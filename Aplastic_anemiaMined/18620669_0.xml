<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experience with this approach from Spanish Working Party for Bone Marrow Transplantation in Children in two sequential time periods (1982-1990 and 1991-2004) is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty two consecutive patients with a median age of 10 years were transplanted; 18 in the 1982-1990 period and 44 in the 1991-2004 period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conditioning regimen consisted mainly of irradiation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> in the first period (72 % of patients) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> +/- anti-thymocyte globulin (62 %) in the second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">Graft versus host disease</z:e> prophylaxis consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> in most patients (57/62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty one patients are alive and disease-free at a median follow-up of 127 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five years probability of event-free survival is 82 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The survival increased from 61 % to 91 % during the two time periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients died from graft failure or rejection (3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (4) or multi-organ failure (4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis identified two significant prognostic factors: interval diagnostic/transplant and time period of transplant (for both p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This experience corroborates that allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is the best treatment for severe acquired aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, with a current disease-free survival of 90 % of patients </plain></SENT>
