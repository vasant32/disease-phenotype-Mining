<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">Chloramphenicol</z:chebi>, an antibiotic associated with reversible bone marrow suppression and fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, was found to increase human bone marrow granulocyte-macrophage colonies (CFU-GM) in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Maximal stimulation was at a concentration of 1.0 micrograms/ml (3.1 microM), with inhibition at concentrations greater than 10 micrograms/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This effect was noted in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors and in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> of various etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stimulation was ablated by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of bone-marrow-adherent cells and was restored by addition of peripheral-blood-adherent mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The stimulatory effect appears to be specific for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi>, as numerous structural analogues of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi>, including its three stereoisomers, did not show stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The stimulation was present at plateau concentrations of colony-stimulating activity, suggesting that the stimulatory effect is not due to elaboration of excess colony-stimulating activity by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that low concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> stimulate CFU-GM by a highly specific interaction with adherent mononuclear cells and elaboration of an undefined growth factor </plain></SENT>
