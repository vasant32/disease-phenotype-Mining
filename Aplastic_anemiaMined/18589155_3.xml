<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this respect, the presence of an active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> prior to transplantation may hinder subsequent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT); which sometimes is the only curative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here the results of 13 consecutive patients transplanted with active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (7 males and 6 females) with a median age of 34 years (range, 16-53 years) underwent 15 HSCT between September 2003 and April 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this group of 15 patients, consisting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> with high risk of relapse or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, 11 (73%) transplants performed in subjects with active invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> (IFI) patients survived 30 days after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients (1 patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> relapse, 1 patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> [GVHD] complicated with fungal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, and 1 patient with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sinusoidal obstruction syndrome</z:e> and GVHD complicated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011951'>aspiration pneumonia</z:hpo>) died on days +66, +74, and +62 posttransplantation, respectively, within the first 100 days of HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up time of 306 days (range, 145-680 days), four of 13 (31%) patients with active IFI were alive and disease free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among a population of HSCT recipients with a dismal prognosis without transplantation, performing the procedure despite active IFI saved a considerable proportion of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of active IFI did not seem to be an absolute contraindication for HSCT, particularly among high-risk patients in whom a treatment delay could be fatal </plain></SENT>
