<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the 32 years between 1955 and 1986 more than 15,000 patients received allogeneic transplants; more than 50% of these were performed in the 3 years, 1984 to 1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transplantation is an effective therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo>; in some instances it is the preferred treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and some genetic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immune deficiency</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005956" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diseases, bone marrow</z:e> transplantation provides the only possibility for cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow transplantation is investigational in other conditions and is associated with substantial problems such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs-host disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006515'>interstitial pneumonitis</z:hpo>, and the requirement for an HLA-identical donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recently an increasing number of transplants have been performed using HLA partially or fully matched related or unrelated donors with some success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The development of AGVHD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006515'>interstitial pneumonitis</z:hpo> can to some extent be predicted by risk factor assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AGVHD can be prevented by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of T cells from the donor bone marrow but this is associated with an increased risk of graft rejection and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0006515'>Interstitial pneumonitis</z:hpo> can be modified by prophylaxis with CMV immune globulin and by the use of CMV-negative blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this report we summarized data from the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry concerning allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
