<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively studied 49 patients in a single institute to evaluate the long-term outcome of total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) conditioning for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients had received transfusions and had undergone previous treatment, with 33 receiving related transplants and 16 receiving unrelated transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conditioning consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (Cy; 200 mg/kg) plus TLI (750 cGy) for related transplantation and Cy plus total body irradiation (TBI; 500 cGy) and TLI (500 cGy) for unrelated transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) was added for 6 of the unrelated transplantations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">Graft-versus-host-disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted mainly of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CSA) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Graft failure developed in 2 patients (4.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 7 years, overall survival (OS) was 81% and was not statistically significantly different between the patients receiving related transplants and those receiving unrelated transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, a history of previous treatment with ATG was the sole factor associated with a worse survival rate, and the interval from diagnosis to treatment was not prognostic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (grade II to IV) GVHD (aGVHD) was 23%, and that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (cGVHD) was 29% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Female-to-male transplantation was the sole factor associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> developed only after the ATG-containing conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0810248" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">other secondary malignancies</z:e> developed after long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that TLI conditioning is feasible and effective for patients with AA </plain></SENT>
