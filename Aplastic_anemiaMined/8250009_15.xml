<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IFN-gamma was not detected in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood plasma (PBP) or bone marrow plasma (BMP) and was present in PBP from only 2 of 22 patients and in BMP from 1 of 14 patients and the levels were low (&lt; 1.5 U/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of TNF-alpha were present in BMP and PBP from patients but not in control (healthy donor) PBP and BMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven of twenty-four patients had elevated levels of TNF-alpha in their PBP and 6 of 13 patients had detectable levels of TNF-alpha in their BMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only one of the 14 healthy control donors had detectable TNF-alpha and the level was very low (7 pg/ml), while 13 of the 27 ApAn patients had detectable TNF-alpha (P = .009, chi-square test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Not surprisingly, the centers of the distributions of TNF-alpha concentrations of the controls and ApAn patients differed significantly (P &lt; .017 for control and patient PBP and P &lt; .056 for control and patient BMP, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha by cultured bone marrow mononuclear cells was observed in four of seven patients but not in the six healthy controls (P = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha by cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients and controls was however similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha by cultured mononuclear cells did not differ significantly between ApAn patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The significance of overproduction of TNF-alpha in the pathophysiology of ApAn is discussed </plain></SENT>
