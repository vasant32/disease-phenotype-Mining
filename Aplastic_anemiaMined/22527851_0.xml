<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The wide variety of clinical courses that lead to the development of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) makes it difficult to speculate whether treatment for AA is required in the early phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to identify a method for predicting the clinical course of AA at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, in healthy adults, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) released per platelet was measured by the activation of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum concentration of VEGF, serum concentration of VEGF corrected for platelet count, and serum concentration of VEGF corrected for both platelet count and hematocrit (corrected VEGF) were then compared to VEGF released per platelet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Corrected VEGF showed the best correlation with VEGF released per platelet by the activation of PRP in healthy subjects (R (2) = in a single 0.806, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Next, corrected VEGF was assayed in 11 pediatric patients with AA at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Corrected VEGF in AA patients was significantly greater than that in age-matched control subjects [1.32 × 10(-6) pg (range 0.36-1.85) vs. 0.18 × 10(-6) pg (range 0.12-0.94)] (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, corrected VEGF in AA patients who did not require treatment for more than 2 years was significantly greater than that in AA patients who required earlier treatment [1.67 × 10(-6) pg (range 1.32-1.85) vs. 0.87 × 10(-6) pg (0.36-1.34)] (p = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that a compensatory mechanism for increasing VEGF and preventing disease progression might play a role in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Corrected VEGF may be useful for predicting the clinical course of AA </plain></SENT>
