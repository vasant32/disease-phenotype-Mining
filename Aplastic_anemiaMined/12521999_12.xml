<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immune resistance by lymphoid and natural killer (NK) populations with "barrier" function is well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-identical marrow allografts were examined to investigate effector pathways in non-NK-mediated resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Barrier function was examined in cytotoxic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and deficient B6 (H-2(b)) recipients primed to donor minor histocompatibility antigen (MiHA) prior to BM transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Host resistance was sensitively evaluated by colony-forming unit (CFU) assays to directly assess for donor progenitor cell (PC) and peripheral chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>B6 host CD8(+) T cells but not CD4(+) or NK1.1(+) cells effected rejection of primitive (CFU-HPP [high-proliferative potential]) and lineage-committed (CFU-IL3/GM [interleukin 3/granulocyte macrophage]) allogeneic donor progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To address complementation by the cytotoxic pathways existing in singly deficient (perforin or FasL) recipients, cytotoxically double (perforin plus FasL) deficient (cdd) recipients were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Resistance in B6-cdd recipients was comparable to that of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> B6 recipients and was also dependent on CD8(+) T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A "triple" cytotoxic deficient model, involving transplantation of TNFR1(-/-) (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor receptor 1) progenitor grafts did not diminish the ability of B6-cdd recipients to reject allografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, injection of anti-TRAIL (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-related <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing ligand) monoclonal antibody (mAb) in B6-cdd recipients also failed to inhibit rejection of TNFR1(-/-) marrow grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In total, these studies demonstrate that CD8(+) host T cells can effectively resist MHC-matched MiHA-mismatched donor PCs via alternative effector pathway(s) independent of perforin-, FasL-, TNFR-1-, and TRAIL-dependent cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, inhibition of these effector pathways in sensitized recipients is unlikely to result in stem cell engraftment following PC allografts </plain></SENT>
