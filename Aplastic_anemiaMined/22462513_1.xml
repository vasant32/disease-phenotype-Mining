<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (median age at diagnosis, 11 yr) with refractory AAA without a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e> underwent HSCT from matched unrelated (n = 6) or haploidentical (n = 1) donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conditioning regimens included CY (n = 7), muromonab-CD3/ATG (n = 7), TT (n = 6), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e> (n = 5), and TLI (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Grafts were either CD34 purified and/or CD3/19 depleted and contained a median of 10.17 × 10(6) /kg CD34 and 5.5 × 10(4) /kg CD3 cells </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median time to leukocyte engraftment was 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 26 (range, 11-153) months, six patients are alive and well with complete donor hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early alternative donor HSCT can help to avoid complications from prolonged IST and presumably improve survival of patients with refractory AAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Administration of high doses of CD34 purified and/or CD3/19 depleted stem cells following novel immunoablative conditioning may prevent graft rejection and GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, a long interval from diagnosis to HSCT seems to be associated with poor outcome </plain></SENT>
