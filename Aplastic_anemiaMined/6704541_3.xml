<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The relationships among <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration (Hb), red cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19324">2,3-diphosphoglycerate</z:chebi> (2,3-DPG), and p50 were studied in 20 chronically hypertransfused patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia major</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the nontransfused control group, which included <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals as well as patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo>, the Hb correlated inversely with both 2,3-DPG concentration and p50, as is well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, however, prior to transfusion, at the nadir of Hb, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia major</z:e> had inappropriately low 2,3-DPG concentrations and p50s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, regardless of whether they had received packed, leukocyte-poor, or frozen-thawed red cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis that the time of blood storage was a factor was excluded by repeatedly transfusing one patient with packed red cells administered within 4 hr of collection in CPDA-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A second hypothesis, that red cell function might be impaired by the iron-overloaded thalassemic environment, was excluded by studying a newly diagnosed, newly transfused patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both cases, the same inability to appropriately increase 2,3-DPG and p50 as the Hb fell during the intertransfusion interval was noticed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that red cells of chronically transfused patients are unable to adapt to the decline in Hb that occurs during the intertransfusion interval </plain></SENT>
