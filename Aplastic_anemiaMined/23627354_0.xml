<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment modalities are complicated by <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is a case report of the successful periodontal and prosthesis treatment in a patient with AA, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0000230'>gingivitis</z:hpo>, excessive tooth <z:hpo ids='HP_0000670'>caries</z:hpo> that interfered with mastication, painful oral lesions, and limited mouth opening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Physiotherapy was performed to improve the mouth opening, and the patient was examined for HBsAg, HBsAb, and HIV; white blood cell and platelet count and coagulation tests were given before every periodontal treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000670'>Caries</z:hpo> removal and root canal therapy were done, hopeless teeth were extracted, and full-mouth crown lengthening was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Free gingival grafts were placed in areas of inadequate keratinized tissue, and full-mouth rehabilitation with fixed prosthesis was completed </plain></SENT>
