<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the stem cell compartment of patients with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) using the long-term culture-initiating cell assay (LTC-IC), in parallel with measurements of CD34+ cells and mature hematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Secondary colonies from cells surviving 5 weeks of long-term bone marrow culture (LTBMC) were determined for the peripheral blood (PB) of 68 AA patients and 13 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and for BM of 49 AA patients and 14 controls; because of low cell numbers, formal limiting dilution analysis could only be performed in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship of cell input in LTBMC and the output of secondary colonies was linear, allowing quantification of LTC-IC number from bulk cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary colony formation was markedly abnormal in severe AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to 7.8 colony-forming cells (CFC)/10(5) mononuclear cells in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM and 0.14 CFC/10(5) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> PB mononuclear cells, patients with severe disease showed 0.024 CFC/10(5) in BM and 0.0068 CFC/10(5) in PB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Under limiting dilution conditions, patients' cells also showed markedly lower colony-forming ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to 4.3 +/- 1 colonies/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LTC-IC, we obtained only 1.27 +/- 0.09 and 2.0 +/- 0.35 colonies from BM of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and recovered cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These values were used to extrapolate LTC-IC numbers from secondary colony formation in suspension cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In PB, calculated LTC-IC were decreased 7.4-fold in new and relapsed severe AA and 2.8-fold in recovered AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In BM, LTC-IC were decreased 10-fold in new and relapsed AA and sixfold in recovered cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared with measurements obtained on presentation, LTC-IC were lower in post-treatment samples from patients who had failed to recover after intensive immunosuppression and relatively higher in cases at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In recovered patients, LTC-IC number increased but remained below the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in 20 of 25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients studied serially for 3 to 12 months after treatment, LTC-IC numbers remained stable but low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LTC-IC number correlated with concurrently determined CD34+ cell number and primary hematopoietic colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that stem cell numbers, as quantitated by the LTC-IC assay, are markedly diminished in number in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> severe AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the function of the stem cell or the stem cell compartment in AA is also abnormal, as inferred from the low clonogenic potential in secondary colony assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Early hematologic improvement in some patients occurs without increasing numbers of LTC-IC, and a minority of recovered cases show apparent repopulation of the LTC-IC compartment years after treatment </plain></SENT>
