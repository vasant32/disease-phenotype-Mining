<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Donors were siblings (four), parents (seven), aunt (one), great aunt (one) or matched unrelated (two) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When compared with transplants using matched sibling donors, survival was not different (51.4 +/- 13.4% vs. 48.1 +/- 9.6%; p = 0.87) but transplant-related complications and morbidity were higher as follows: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) (87% vs. 15%; p less than 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006515'>interstitial pneumonitis</z:hpo> (59% vs. 14%; p less than 0.003), days in hospital (51 vs. 26; p less than 0.001), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> transplant related morbidity 50% vs. 11%; p + 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The age of donors who were closely matched was significantly greater than that of their recipients (29.7 +/- 13.9 years vs. 8.1 +/- 3.1 years; p less than 0.001) and was associated with poorer transplant outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median transplant-related complication-free survival for patients receiving transplants from age non-disparate donors was 53 months (range 18-86 months) compared with 12 months (range 2-42 months) for age disparate donors (p = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transplants from closely matched donors were undertaken in the ratio of one to every three matched donors, indicating the importance of this source of marrow in a transplant program </plain></SENT>
