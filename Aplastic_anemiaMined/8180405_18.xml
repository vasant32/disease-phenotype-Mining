<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of the BM graft has evolved as the most effective method to prevent severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, this beneficial effect is counterbalanced by an increased rate of graft failure and relapse of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To find an approach to T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> that may avoid these extreme risks, we gave BM recipients a fixed low number of 1 x 10(5) donor T cells per kilogram of recipient's body weight in the graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This corresponds with 99% T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> and is achieved by the addition of T cells to the graft that was previously depleted of T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 70 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, including 40 patients with standard-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, received BM grafts, depleted of T cells according to this approach, from HLA-identical siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The preparative regimen consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and total body irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients also received a short course of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Graft failure did not occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> GVHD, only grade I or II, was seen in 70% of the patients and was limited to the skin in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> GVHD occurred in 31% of the patients and, with the exception of 1 patient, was limited to the skin as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Relapse occurred in 3 of 40 (8%) patients with standard-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, resulting in a projected survival at 5 years of 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with standard-risk diseases had a procedure-related mortality of 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Quality of life, determined 1 year after BM transplant, was good in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with standard-risk diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, this approach of T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> may be an approach that avoids the development of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD without damaging the function or antileukemic effect of the graft and that has a low transplant-related morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
