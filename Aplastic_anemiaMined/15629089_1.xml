<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CD8(+) T cells were isolated from peripheral blood of two patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>(SAA) and one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> person by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation and then were purified by immunomagnetic microbead separation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then purified CD8(+) T cells were incubated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27729">digitonin</z:chebi> for 15 min followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-anti-IFN-gamma mAb for 20 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The single cell was detected continuously by CEIA-LIF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The feasibility of the method was confirmed by inverted microscopy and laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The IFN-gamma content in purified CD8(+) T cells was detected under the condition of cell-membrane integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The IFN-gamma level in single CD8(+) T cell from 2 SAA patients was (151.53+/-28.92)zmol and (223.72+/-45.23)zmol, respectively, and much higher that from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control (47.47+/-17.97)zmol ( P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is feasible to quantitate IFN-gamma in single CD8(+) T cell by CEIA-LIF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CEIA-LIF might be useful in the clinical detection of intracellular cytokines </plain></SENT>
