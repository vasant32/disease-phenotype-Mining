<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004387'>enterocolitis</z:hpo> is a devastating bowel wall <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in patients with protracted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The approach for diagnosis and treatment is still controversial, and it is difficult and challenging to decide on what should be the next step in the management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 10-year-old boy who developed neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004387'>enterocolitis</z:hpo> in the course of the conservative treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1568868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Oral mucositis</z:e> and the perianal fissure with an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> were important indicators for what was happening on the colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy and biopsy confirmed the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A fast recovery was achieved with a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Retrospective analysis of the long-term follow-up of our patient suggests that defunctioning the colon by ileostomy breaks the vicious circle between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and bowel wall <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and an early surgical intervention could be considered as an adjunctive approach to the conservative management of persistent cases </plain></SENT>
