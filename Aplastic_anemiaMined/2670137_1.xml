<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latter group was further divided into two subgroups: horse anti-human thymocyte-lymphocyte globulin (ATG-ALG) (2) and high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> (HDMP) (5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 8 males and 8 females, age ranged from 10 to 35 years for the BMT group and 19 to 56 for the immunosuppression group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As of analysis, 9 patients in the BMT group had been followed from 1 to 31 months after transplant (median,24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Graft rejection was noted in 2, both had positive mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven had full recovery of hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival probability at 31 month was 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the immunosuppressive therapy group 2, who received ATG-ALG both failed the treatment, died 7 and 29 months later, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 3 responders in the HDMP subgroup, 1 complete, 2 partial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 1-year survival probability for this group was 42.9% compared with 75% in the BMT group (p greater than 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the hematologic reconstitution and Karnofsky performance were complete in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 transplant survivals vs one of 3 in the immunosuppression group (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This experience supports that for patients with SAA under the age of 40, BMT is the treatment of choice if an HLA-identical MLC-nonreactive marrow donor is available, if not, immunosuppression is an alternative approach.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
