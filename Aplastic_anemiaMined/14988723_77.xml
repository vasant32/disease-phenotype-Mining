<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FA proteins (FANCs) are thought to work in pathway(s) essential for dealing with crosslinked DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FANCs interact with other proteins involved in both DNA repair and S-phase checkpoint such as BRCA1, ATM and the RAD50/MRE11/NBS1 (RMN) complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We deciphered the previously undefined pathway(s) leading to the ICLs-induced S-phase checkpoint and the role of FANCs in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that ICLs activate a branched pathway downstream of the ATR kinase: one branch depending on CHK1 activity and the other on the FANCs-RMN complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The transient slow-down of DNA synthesis was abolished in cells lacking ATR, whereas CHK1-siRNA-treated cells, NBS1 or FA cells showed partial S-phase arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CHK1 RNAi in NBS1 or FA cells abolished the S-phase checkpoint, suggesting that CHK1 and FANCs/NBS1 proteins work on parallel pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that ICLs trigger ATR-dependent FANCD2 phosphorylation and FANCD2/ATR colocalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates a novel relationship between the FA pathway(s) and the ATR kinase </plain></SENT>
