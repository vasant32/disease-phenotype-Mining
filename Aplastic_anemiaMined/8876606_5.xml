<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDD</z:e> and IEM, FLT into postnatal recipients has demonstrated beneficial effects (67%) of the patients were either cured or improved significantly) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 1988, we developed in utero FLT into human fetuses, taking advantage of the immunological tolerance of young fetuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The transplants have involved fetuses suffering from various diseases at 12-28 weeks postfertilization with 2 of the 6 cases eventually resulting in abortion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the 4 other fetuses, a favorable outcome was observed: 3 children are now more than 4 years old, and are alive and well with evidence of engraftment, reconstitution of immunity, and partial correction of beta zero <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the fourth case, the fetus is alive and well and birth is expected soon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In utero transplantation of stem cells is a therapy with remarkable advantages: (a) tolerance induction due to the immune immaturity of the host, (b) lack of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> due to the immaturity of the donor, (c) ideal isolation of the fetus in the maternal uterus, and (d) an optimal environment for donor fetal cell development in the vicinity of host fetal cells and growth factors </plain></SENT>
