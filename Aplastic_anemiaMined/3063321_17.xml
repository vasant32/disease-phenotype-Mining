<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The data were collected in the SAA Registry of the European Bone Marrow Transplant Group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The donors were non-HLA-identical siblings in six cases, parents in 28 cases, a son in one case and unrelated individuals in 11 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen donor-recipient pairs were HLA-A, -B and -DR identical and mutually non-reactive in mixed lymphocyte culture; nine were mismatched at one locus, 17 were mismatched at two or more loci and in five cases data were not available for D/DR determinants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival was predicted by the degree of mismatch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was 45% for phenotypically HLA-identical grafts, 25% for grafts mismatched at one locus and 11% for graft mismatched at more than one locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whether the graft was derived from a family member or an unrelated donor seemed to be less important and results were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age, patient sex and year of transplant had no significant influence on survival </plain></SENT>
