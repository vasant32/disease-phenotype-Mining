<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For SAA patients with complications such as <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, prompt transplantation using either a mismatched related donor or cord blood (CB) becomes necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the former option is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>, whereas the latter option is associated with a more significant risk of graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report a patient with vSAA refractory to IST that was repeatedly complicated by <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> was unavailable for this patient, so we decided on emergent transplantation and successfully performed CB transplantation (CBT) using a low-dose TBI conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although it may be necessary to examine more clinical cases in the future, a conditioning regimen such as that involving low-dose TBI may decrease the risk of graft failure, and CBT may become a treatment option for vSAA in the absence of a suitable donor </plain></SENT>
