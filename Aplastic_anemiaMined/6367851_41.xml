<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We assessed the number of Langerhans cells (LC) before and after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in 27 patients in order to study the fate and behavior of these dendritic antigen-presenting cells following allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LC were identified using monoclonal antibody OKT6 on skin biopsies performed on days - 10, 0, 11, 25, 39, 120, and 365 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a control group composed of 15 healthy adults aged 20-37 yr, the mean number of LC (+/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) was 25.6 +/- 1.17/0.1 sq mm of epidermal surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our study shows that pretransplant, the number of LC in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was lower than that of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The finding of low numbers of LC in patients with untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is suggestive of a medullary origin of LC in man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, during the early posttransplant period, nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients present a severe deficit in LC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This deficit may delay the maturation of their immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of LC reaches nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels 4-12 mo after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, we have noted a significant impairment of LC reconstitution in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD), providing evidence that this defect may be an important mechanism involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
