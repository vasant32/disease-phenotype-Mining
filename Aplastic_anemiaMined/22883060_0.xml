<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The CD8(+)HLA-DR(+) cells were sorted by immunomagnetic separation from the PB of 24 untreated SAA patients and 23 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of perforin, granzyme B, FasL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor β (TNF-β) of sorted cells were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of perforin, granzyme B of CD8(+)HLA-DR(+)T cells in untreated group were higher than those of the controls (0.66 ± 0.25, 0.56 ± 0.26 vs 0.53 ± 0.14, 0.40 ± 0.13, P = 0.042, 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level of FasL in CD8(+)HLA-DR(+) T cells of untreated SAA patients was higher than that of the controls (0.77 ± 0.24 vs 0.61 ± 0.16, P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of TNF-β in CD8(+)HLA-DR(+) T cells of untreated SAA patients was also higher than that of the controls (0.58 ± 0.16 vs 0.46 ± 0.15, P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CD8(+)HLA-DR(+) T cells may damage hematopoiesis through the actions of perforin, granzyme B, TNF-β and FasL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>And it thus contributes to the immunopathogenesis of SAA </plain></SENT>
