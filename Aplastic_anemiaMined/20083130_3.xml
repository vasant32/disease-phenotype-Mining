<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exposures to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> both prenatally and during adulthood are associated with the development of disorders such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> toxicity are unknown; however, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> metabolites may play a role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Little is known regarding the effects of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> metabolites on erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, to determine the effects of in utero exposure to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> on the growth and differentiation of fetal erythroid progenitor cells (CFU-E), pregnant CD-1 mice were exposed to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> and CFU-E numbers were assessed in fetal liver (hematopoietic) tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, to determine the effect of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> metabolite-induced ROS generation on erythropoiesis, HD3 chicken erythroblast cells were exposed to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> followed by stimulation of erythrocyte differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results show that in utero exposure to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> caused significant alterations in female offspring CFU-E numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, exposure to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi>, but not <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi>, significantly reduced the percentage of differentiated HD3 cells, which was associated with an increase in ROS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of HD3 cells with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi>-conjugated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-SOD) prevented <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi>-induced inhibition of erythropoiesis, supporting the hypothesis that ROS generation is involved in the development of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> erythrotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study provided evidence that ROS generated as a result of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> metabolism may significantly alter erythroid differentiation, potentially leading to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Blood Disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
