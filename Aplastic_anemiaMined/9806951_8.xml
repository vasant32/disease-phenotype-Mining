<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Felbamate (FBM) is a novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drug that was approved in 1993 for treatment of several forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After its introduction, toxic reactions (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e>) associated with its use were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is unknown whether FBM or one of its metabolites is responsible for these idiosyncratic adverse reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the metabolism of FBM has not been fully characterized, three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35220">primary metabolites</z:chebi> of FBM have been identified, i.e. 2-hydroxy, p-hydroxy, and monocarbamate metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the monocarbamate metabolite leads to a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33575">carboxylic acid</z:chebi>, which is the major metabolite of FBM in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Formation of the hydroxylated products of FBM involves <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> enzymes, but the enzymes involved in the formation and further metabolism of the monocarbamate have not yet been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recently, mercapturate metabolites of FBM have been identified in human urine, and a metabolic scheme involving reactive <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17478">aldehyde</z:chebi> metabolite formation from the monocarbamate metabolite has been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study confirmed the formation of the proposed metabolites using human liver tissue in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17478">aldehyde</z:chebi> intermediates were trapped as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> derivatives, and the cyclic equilibrium product (proposed as a storage and transport form for the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17478">aldehydes</z:chebi>) was monitored directly by HPLC or GC/MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Formation of putative toxic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17478">aldehyde</z:chebi> intermediates and the major <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33575">carboxylic acid</z:chebi> metabolite of FBM was differentially effected with the cofactors <z:chebi fb="5" ids="25523">NADP</z:chebi>+ and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi>+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the cofactors may influence the relative metabolism via activation and inactivation pathways </plain></SENT>
