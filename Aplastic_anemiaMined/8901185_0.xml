<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It remains still unclear which immunophenotypes of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> must be expected thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here it is reported about two children with quite different immunophenotypes of the leukaemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first one the most common type was found, the constellation of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">c-ALL</z:e>, whereas in the other the precise classification was impossible at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myeloic and T-cell markers were present at the same time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This form of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> was not influenced therapeutically in a sufficient manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient died after recovery phases of only short duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemias</z:hpo> with fast recovery by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> ALL of different constellation has to be expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore the antileukaemic treatment immediately after recovery of the aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> should be taken into consideration </plain></SENT>
