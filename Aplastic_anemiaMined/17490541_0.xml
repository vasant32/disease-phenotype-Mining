<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients were diagnosed as A-PRCA based on bone marrow smear and biopsy, and were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A and glucosidorum tripterygll totorum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The flow cytometry technique was used for analyses of T cells subsets and gammadelta T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, peripheral mononuclear cells (MNC) isolated from A-PRCA patients were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (10(5) cells/ml) containing 10% FCS, phytohemagglutinin (PHA, 10 microg/ml), and recombinant human interleukin-2 (rIL-2, 50 U/ml) for two weeks, then gammadelta T cells were isolated with the TCRgammadelta Microbead Kit from cultured cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The collected gammadelta T cells were incubated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control bone marrow MNC in RPMI 1640 medium (37 degrees C, 5% <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> atmosphere) for CFU-E, CFU-GM, and BFU-E colony assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The result showed that compared with the control group, CD3(+), CD8(+) cells increased significantly in the patient group (P &lt; 0.05), the CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio decreased and reversed, and gammadelta T cells were significantly increased in patient group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A, 9 out of 11 patients got good response, and CD3(+), CD8(+) cells in the responding patient decreased, the ratio of CD4(+)/CD8(+) returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and gammadelta T cells also decreased to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in vitro culture, the gammadelta T cells isolated from A-PRCA patients showed an inhibiting action to CFU-E and BFU-E but not to CFU-GM in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that gammadelta T cells increase in A-PRCA patients, and decrease in parallel to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range with significant improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> symptoms after immune suppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The gammadelta T cells isolated from A-PRCA patients showed an inhibiting action to CFU-E and BFU-E but not to CFU-GM in vitro culture, suggesting that gammadelta T cells may bring an impact on the research of A-PRCA pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi> A demonstrated better therapeutic effect on A-PRCA patients </plain></SENT>
