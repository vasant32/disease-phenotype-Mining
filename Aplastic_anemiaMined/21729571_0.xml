<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was purposed to evaluate the long-term outcome and the safety of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) treated by interleukin 2 (IL-2) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the therapy of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The therapy of 49 patients admitted BG in hospital from April 2001 to December 2007 were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PBMNC were isolated and cultured for 48 hours in presence of IL-2 and GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cells were collected, and 6 × 10(6) - 1 × 10(8) PBMNC were intravenously injected weekly for 4 - 22 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic recovery was evaluated by examinations of peripheral blood, bone marrow aspirates and bone marrow biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry was used to assess the peripheral T cell subsets before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction was performed to observe the clonal diversity of T cell receptor variable β-chain (TCR-Vβ) recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that 37 cases were cured and none of them relapsed during the follow-up, 5 cases were in partial remission, 3 cases got improvement, and 4 cases showed no response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The total efficiency reached up to 91.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ratios of CD4(+)/CD8(+) subsets were abnormal in 39 patients prior to the treatment, and 31 cases restored to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range after cell transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analysis on the clonal diversity of TCR-Vβ recombination in 11 patients showed the transition from monoclonal or biclonal spectratype to polyclonal one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No long-term side effects were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the treatment with PBMNC treated by IL-2 and GM-CSF is generally safe and effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The underlying mechanisms may be in relation to the restoration of cell immunity </plain></SENT>
