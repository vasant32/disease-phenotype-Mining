<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The outcomes for 18 children with AA who underwent allogeneic BMT were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age was 11 yr (range 4-16), and nine were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As conditioning regimens, seven had low-dose irradiation + CY, six had ATG + CY + Flu, and five had ATG + CY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Donors were HLA-matched siblings in 10, HLA-mismatched family in one, HLA-matched unrelated in three, and HLA-mismatched unrelated in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As GVHD prophylaxis, three received CsA alone, nine received CsA + MTX, and six received tacrolimus + MTX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 18 patients showed engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median number of days until the neutrophil count exceeded 500/μL was 16 (range 11-21) post-transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five developed more than grade 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, and three developed extensive cGVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient died because of interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> complicated with cGVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five-yr OS was 94% (95% CI: 83-105) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a strategy of treating patients based on the best-available evidence is acceptable </plain></SENT>
