<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Doses of rhG-CSF ranging from 400 to 2,000 micrograms/m2/d were administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion daily for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 6 of the 10 children, treatment increased the neutrophil count by 10-fold to greater than 60-fold (range, 0.21 to 1.8 x 10(9)/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>Bacterial</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e> that were present at study entry resolved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 responders, who are still alive with a median survival of more than 27 months (range, 15 to 54 months) since the initiation of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of 4 nonresponders died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, whereas 1 nonresponder received a bone marrow transplant and is alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No serious toxicity was attributable to rhG-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was well tolerated at doses up to 2,000 micrograms/m2/d and effectively stimulated granulopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This agent thus offers promise as adjuvant treatment for severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
