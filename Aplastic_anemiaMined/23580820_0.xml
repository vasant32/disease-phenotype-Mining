<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant using human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling or unrelated bone marrow, or related or unrelated cord blood has been performed successfully to treat patients with different types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> and hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immune deficiencies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since 1983, stem cell transplantation has been carried out in different institutes of India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>But, till then, no transplantation was performed in eastern India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our present study is reporting for the first time stem cell transplantation in eastern India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From August 2000 to June 2011 (with a 3-year gap for up-gradation), we have performed a total of 22 transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (M:F:9:4) with indications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassaemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> underwent allogenic transplant, whereas autologous transplant was performed for nine patients (M:F:2:1) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age of the patients was 19.6 years, with a range of 5 years 8 months to 52 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients received myeloablative conditioning regime whereas eight patients received immunosuppressive and less myeloablative protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sources of stem cells in case of allogenic transplant are bone marrow and related or unrelated umbilical cord blood and in case of autologous transplant, these are peripheral blood stem cells or self-bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Standard prophylactic medication was followed prior to transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A disease-free survival of 68.18% and overall survival of 86.3% were seen at the median follow-up period of 4.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Common post-transplant complications were mucositis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948441" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="VOD">venoocclusive disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085692" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhagic cystitis</z:e>, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of cord blood as a source of stem cells has been proved inferior as compared with the bone marrow stem cell source in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassaemia</z:e> in our institute and thus is not recommended for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>But, it has been proved to be a very useful and effective stem cell source (both related and unrelated cord blood) in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and other immunological disorders </plain></SENT>
