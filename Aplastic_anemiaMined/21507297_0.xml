<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the expression of CD4+ CD25int/high CD127low regulatory T cells in peripheral blood (PB) and its relation to the quantity of Hb, WBC and platelet (Plt) in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression of CD4+ CD25int/high CD127low in PB was detected by flow cytometry in 22 children with AA before and after treatment and in 15 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationships between CD4+CD25highCD127low and the quantity of Hb, WBC and Plt were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to controls, the percentages of CD4+ CD25+/CD4+, CD4+CD25high/CD4+, CD4+ CD25+ CD127low/CD4+ and CD4+CD25highCD127low/CD4+ in PB of AA patients decreased markedly at the active phase (P﹤0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By the recovery phase, the percentages of CD4+CD25+/CD4+, CD4+CD25high/CD4+, CD4+ CD25+ CD127low/CD4+ and CD4+CD25highCD127low/CD4+ increased significantly to the levels similar to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were significant positive relationships between the expression of CD4+CD25highCD127low cells and the quantity of Hb, WBC and Plt (r=0.499, 0.526, 0.540 respectively; P﹤0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The decrease of the percentage of CD4+CD25int/highCD127low regulatory T cells might be associated with the development of pediatric AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CD4+CD25int/highCD127low regulatory T cells can serve as a marker for the evaluation of disease severity as well as a target of further study on immune treatment of AA </plain></SENT>
