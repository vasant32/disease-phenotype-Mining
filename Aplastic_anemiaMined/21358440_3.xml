<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> is highly toxic to lymphocytes but spares hematopoietic stem cells because of their abundant levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17478">aldehyde</z:chebi> dehydrogenase, the major mechanism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> therapy induces durable remissions in most patients with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> without hematopoietic stem cell rescue has shown activity in a variety of other severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we review the history of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> as it applies to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We include historical data from early patients treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> as well as data from 140 patients from an observational retrospective study in a single tertiary care hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This latter component was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> therapy without stem cell rescue in patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the 140 patients with severe, progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients discussed here received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, 50 mg/kg per day for 4 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Response, relapse, and overall survival were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Response was defined as a decrease in disease activity in conjunction with a decrease or elimination of immune-modulating drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Relapse was defined as worsening disease activity and/or a requirement for an increase in dose of, or administration of new, immunosuppressive medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Hematologic recovery occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 94%, and 44% of those patients remained progression free with a median follow-up of 36 months (range, 1-120 mo) for the 140 patients analyzed together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The overall actuarial and event-free survival across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diseases at 60 months was 90.7% and 20.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>High-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> without stem cell rescue is well tolerated and induces a high rate of remission in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
