<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) is probably an immune-mediated disorder, and immunosuppressive therapy is recommended for patients with no available donor for bone marrow transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between October 1984 and November 1987, 25 consecutive children and adolescents with SAA with no HLA-compatible marrow donor received equine antithymocyte globulin (ATG) (15 mg kg-1 day-1) for 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were evaluated 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after starting ATG treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, patients were evaluated yearly until July 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median age was 10 years (range, 1.5-20 years), granulocyte counts on referral ranged from 0.032 to 1.4 x 10(9)/l (median 0.256 x 10(9)/l), and 12 patients had granulocyte counts &lt;0.2 x 10(9)/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 9.6 years (range, 8.6-11.8 years), 10 patients (40%) remained alive with good marrow function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No morphologic evidence of hematological clonal disorders has been observed, although two patients probably have acquired clonal chromosomal abnormalities (<z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 and del(6)q21, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Responses to ATG were observed between 6 weeks and 6 months from the start of treatment in 60% of evaluable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The response rate was not different in patients whose granulocyte count at diagnosis was &lt;0.2 x 10(9)/l, or in those who were &lt;10 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study supports the view that, when compared with supportive measures, ATG is an effective treatment for children or adolescents with SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although these results are inferior to those reported for marrow transplantation or more intensive immunosuppressive regimens, these patients who responded to ATG are long-term survivors with stable peripheral blood counts and a low rate of relapse </plain></SENT>
