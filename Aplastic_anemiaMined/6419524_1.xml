<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Healthy adult males had 433 FSC and adult females had 244 FSC in 1 X 10(5) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean numbers of FSC in 1 X 10(5) lymphocyte-enriched fraction were 120 in males and 53 in females, and those in 1 X 10(5) monocyte-enriched fraction were 932 in males and 668 in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that monocytes contain about 8-13 times as many FSC as lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each fraction of PBM from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> contains only about half as many FSC as those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas, in states of increased iron storage such as seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001924'>sideroblastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>, the mean numbers of FSC are markedly increased to about 4-8 times in PBM, about 11-20 times in lymphocytes and about 3-7 times in monocytes, compared with each counterpart of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
