<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to investigate the cytotoxicity as well as the genotoxicity of CAP and six of its metabolites on human bone marrow cells (RiBM cells) and to compare these results with those obtained on human peripheral blood lymphocytes in order to estimate the relative sensitivity of the two types of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three CAP metabolites NO-CAP, DH-CAP and NPAP inhibited 3H <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation in RiBM cells at concentrations ranging from 2.10(-5) M to 2.10(-4) M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NO-CAP appeared as the most potent cytotoxic compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CAP itself and NAPD presented some toxic effect at high concentration (1-2.10(-3) M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CAPG and HAP did not present any cytotoxic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By comparison, the response of human lymphocytes to CAP and its metabolites showed a similar pattern but DH-CAP was the most inhibitory compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concerning the genotoxic potential, NO-CAP and DH-CAP induced DNA single strand breaks in RiBM cells at concentrations of 1 and 2.10(-4) M with a dose response relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CAP and other metabolites were completely devoid of genotoxicity up to 4.10(-3) M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results clearly showed that RiBM cells were much less susceptible to the genotoxic effect of CAP metabolites than human lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
