<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether accelerated senescence of hematopoietic stem cells might underlie the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) occurring as a late complication of AA, we studied mean telomere length (TRF) in peripheral blood leukocytes from 79 patients with AA, Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> in comparison with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TRF lengths in the patient group were significantly shorter for age than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Telomere shortening was apparent in both granulocyte and mononuclear cell fractions, suggesting loss at the level of the hematopoietic stem cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with acquired AA with persistent cytopenias (n = 40), there was significant correlation between telomere loss and disease duration (r = -.685; P &lt; .0001), equivalent to progressive telomere <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> at 216 bp/yr, in addition to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> age-related loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients who had achieved <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> full blood counts (n = 20), the rate of telomere loss had apparently stabilised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no apparent association between telomere loss and secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> (n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, of the 5 patients in the study with TRF less than 5.0 kb, 3 had acquired cytogenetic abnormalities, suggesting that telomere <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> may be relevant to the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
