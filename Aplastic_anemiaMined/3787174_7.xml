<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Serum erythropoietic activity was determined in 32 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">beta thalassemia major</z:e> and intermedia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Quantitation was performed by an in vitro bioassay using rabbit erythroid precursor cells (CFU-E) either by colony assay or by 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>20 polytransfused beta-thalassemic major patients had erythropoietic activity (mean 89.3 +/- 36 milliunits/ml) which was not significantly different (p greater than 0.2) from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals (51.3 +/- 32 milliunits/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>12 untransfused patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0472767" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">beta thalassemia intermedia</z:e> were found to have comparable serum erythropoietic activity (p greater than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These levels were much lower than those found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who had a comparable degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have shown that the low EPO activity in thalassemic patients was not due to experimental conditions (excess of ferritin, low transferrin) nor to specific inhibitors appearing in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the erythropoietic activity and sex or other clinical parameters of the patients such as severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, splenectomy, iron chelation or transfusion therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>4 young thalassemic children (1-2 yr of age) studied had high erythropoietic activity ranging from 661 to 5793 milliunits/ml--significantly different from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children of the same age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is suggested, therefore, that a decrease in serum erythropoietin levels develops during the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
