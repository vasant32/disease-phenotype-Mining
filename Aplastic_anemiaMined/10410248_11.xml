<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Total body irradiation (TBI) is a routine preconditioning procedure for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, prior to bone marrow transplantation (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ionizing radiation generates reactive oxygen derived species (ROS) that can be removed by <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose is to determine the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status of patients undergoing TBI by evaluating the oxidant stress and their <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) the total <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity (<z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi>) in plasma of 14 patients undergoing TBI prior to BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> (AA) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> (UA) were determined by HPLC-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The oxidant stress level was calculated by the ratio [dehydro <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi>]/total <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi>] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi> was reduced by 36% (p &lt; 0.02) but after 4 months recovered to a level 22% higher than before the treatment (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both, AA and UA, decreased following irradiation by 84% (p &lt; 0.02) and 24% (p &lt; 0.05) respectively, but returned to a level of 21% and 320% after 4 months compared to baseline values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The changes in [UA] were affected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">Allopurinol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35634">xanthine oxidase inhibitor</z:chebi>), given as a routine pretransplant therapy until day -1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The [dehydroascorcbic acid]/[total <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi>] (%) was 45% (range of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls = 13.2 +/- 1.5%) and increased by 69% following TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In order to obtain a decrease in the <z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi> of plasma in vitro, comparable to that in vivo, a 1000 fold higher dose of irradiation was required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TBI caused a pronounced decrease in <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity and an excessive increase in oxidant stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We assume that TBI alters <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> homeostasis greatly enhancing the stress damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CV measurements may lead to a better understanding of the balance between oxidant stress and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> utilization, and to a reconsideration of the routine use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">Allopurinol</z:chebi> as pretreatment for TBI, and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> support before and/or after TBI </plain></SENT>
