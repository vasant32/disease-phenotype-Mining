<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a single institution 61 individuals with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) were identified; of these, 33 were followed for at least 3 months, 26 could be treated with immunosuppression (IS), 20 with antithymocyte globulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (ATG + CyA) and 6 with CyA, whereas 7 individuals were given only anabolic <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the patients treated with IS a complete remission was achieved in 12 and a partial remission in 6, the overall response rate being 69% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 5,729-day overall survival (SV) was 54%; it was superior for the patients who received both ATG and CyA (58 vs. 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data contrast with those of the patients who were given only <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi>: 14% SV at 5,510 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the group of patients who received IS, one developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, another <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> and another a primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjögren's syndrome</z:e>-associated low-grade, B cell, non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two individuals who received IS were allografted from HLA-identical siblings and survived 70 and 413 days after the allograft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, we also found that, for several reasons, mainly economic ones, only 41% of individuals with SAA finally benefited from the best immunosuppressive therapeutic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IS was a good therapeutic choice for some patients with SAA, clearly better than <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
