<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Much progress has been made in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (AL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In SAA it was shown that hemopoietic chimerism and apparently permanent cures can be achieved in the majority of patients by conditioning with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> followed by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from an HLA-identical sibling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The previous transfusion history is crucial for failure or success: untransfused patients do very well while graft rejection is an enormous problem in most polytransfused ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have shown that most patients without HLA-identical sibling donors can be adequately helped as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After conditioning with ALG followed by transfusion of haploidentical marrow and low dose <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> there is partial to complete autologous hemopoietic reconstitution in virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This points to the fact that most of these patients have pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells that are intact, but apparently unable to differentiate to mature cells, because they are inhibited by autoimmune mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of BMT in patients with endstage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> are modest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>New pilotstudies with early marrow grafts, i.e. for ANLL in first remission and for ALL in second remission indicate that with this type of approach potentially over 50% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with HLA-identical siblings can be cured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We recommend that HLA-typing should be performed early in families with SAA and AL and that the possibility of a marrow graft should be seriously considered before the patients have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endstage disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Marrow grafts are technically simple but they may pose enormous problems such as graft versus host reaction (GvH), interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, graft rejection and leukemic recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the procedure should only be performed in highly specialized centers with much knowledge and experience in the immunobiology of bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
