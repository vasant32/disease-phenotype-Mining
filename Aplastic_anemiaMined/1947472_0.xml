<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Four males and two females, aged 13 to 57 years (median 22 years), with acquired severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) were treated with intravenous bolus of high doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50366">6-methylprednisolone</z:chebi> (MPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients received MPL within a 30-day period at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day (3 days), 10 mg/kg/day (4 days), 5 mg/kg/day (4 days), 2 mg/kg/day (9 days), and 1 mg/kg/day (10 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within the first 3 months following MPL therapy, a response rate of 83%, assessed by means of increase in reticulocytes, neutrophils or platelets, was recorded in the group: two cases showed partial response and three improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 3-month, and 1-, 2- and 3-year survival of the group was 67%, 50%, 33% and 33%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001896'>reticulocytopenia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> prior MPL therapy, nor age, gender, etiology of AA or time between diagnosis and initiation of MPL influenced survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, neutrophil counts before MPL treatment had a strong prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with less than 0.5 x 10(9)/L neutrophils had a median survival of 4.2 months (range 1.2 to 5.2 months) as compared to the 36.1 months median survival (range 12.1 to 36.8 months) of patients whose neutrophil counts were greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data suggest that the administration of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> two months after MPL therapy did not modify survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that high-dose MPL is useful in the treatment of some patients with acquired severe AA, particularly in those with greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/L neutrophils who are not candidates for bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
