<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients who had an HLA-identical sibling donor underwent bone marrow transplantation after conditioning with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and low-dose total-body radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients who did not have an HLA-identical donor received ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 2-year actuarial survival of patients after transplant is 72% (95%, CI 64% to 80%), versus 45% (95%, CI 29% to 61%) in those given ATG therapy (P = 0.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In those patients surviving 6 months after treatment, return of peripheral blood counts to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values was more common in patients who received marrow transplant compared with those given ATG therapy (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 24 of 26 transplant survivors had Karnofsky performance scores greater than 90%, compared with only five of 13 ATG survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that bone marrow transplantation is the preferred therapy for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in young patients who have an HLA-identical sibling donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ATG should be reversed for those young patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who do not have a histocompatible marrow donor </plain></SENT>
