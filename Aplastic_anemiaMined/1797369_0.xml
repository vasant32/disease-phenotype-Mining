<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To understand the hematological changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0006562'>viral hepatitis</z:hpo>, 324 adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0006562'>viral hepatitis</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of them, 3 were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> A, 91 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B, 99 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-A, non-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> (NANB) and 181 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B (AH on CH-B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 233 males and 91 females; age ranged from 16 to 74 years (mean age 39 years.) The results showed the incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (platelet less than 120,000/cmm), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (Hb less than 12 g% in male and less than 10% in female patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> (WBC greater than 10,000/cmm) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> (WBC less than 4,000/cmm) were 19.3%, 12.6%, 10.8% and 7.4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with AH on CH-B had significantly higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> than those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> B <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>; other than this, there was no significant difference </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, there were 3 cases (0.9%) complicated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two were NANB <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> and the other was AH on CH-B which was seronegative for anti-delta, possibly suggesting NANB virus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these 3 cases, 2 died of complications related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and 1 survived with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematological findings 148 days later </plain></SENT>
