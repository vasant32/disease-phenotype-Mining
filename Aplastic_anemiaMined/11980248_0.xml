<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe the process of obtaining access to the administrative health care utilization data of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan and the ethical issues involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The report focuses on the process of obtaining data for two recent studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first, associations between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> and prior drug use were evaluated, while the second is an examination of anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> drug utilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these studies, data from files containing computerized information on prescription drug use, hospitalizations, physician services and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registrations were linked together and also with information from hospital charts, physician records and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> registrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data on individual patients are available from the Saskatchewan data-files after the removal of identifying variables, and access to external information from hospitals, physicians, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> registrations and the patients themselves is possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, researchers must accept that data considered to be only indirectly relevant to the objectives of the study or which, due to small numbers, may potentially identify either patients or physicians will only be released in aggregate form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Access to the Saskatchewan data-files and to external information from hospitals, physicians and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> registrations is normally straightforward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Restrictions that are applied are discussed </plain></SENT>
