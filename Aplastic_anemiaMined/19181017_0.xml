<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> at any time in the clinical course implies poor prognosis in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This warrants a need for the early detection of chromosomal abnormalities for prognosis and delineation of therapeutic modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and 30 controls were studied with an aim to determine the role of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> as an indicator of chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> analysis was carried out by flow cytometry using Mod Fit-LT V3.0 software, whereas chromosomal analysis was performed by conventional cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DNA <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> was present in 14% of cases and chromosomal abnormalities were found in 4% of cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> at the time of diagnosis before therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, DNA <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> was detected in 36% of cases by flow cytometry, whereas the cytogenetic method revealed chromosomal abnormalities in 14% of cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis showed hypodiploidy in one patient at the time of diagnosis who developed <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with hypodiploidy had short survival and they did not respond to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates the role of flow cytometry in the early detection of chromosomal abnormalities in patients at a time when they remain undetected by conventional cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of DNA <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> may be an early indicator of subsequent overt cytogenetic abnormality, associated with poor response to immunosuppressive therapy and a lower survival </plain></SENT>
