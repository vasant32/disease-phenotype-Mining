<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>Hepatitis</z:hpo>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is a variant of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> follows an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> attack of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, however, is often fatal if untreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To characterize the illness, investigate the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> viruses, and assess the response to immunosuppressive treatment, we studied patients with the syndrome who were referred to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Standard hematologic and biochemical tests and measurements of bone marrow cellularity were used to monitor the patients' response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum was assayed for antibodies and antigens related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> A, B, and C viruses and for the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C and GB virus C by the polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with antithymocyte globulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were referred to the NIH between 1990 and 1996; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had the typical features of this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was evidence of activated CD8 T lymphocytes in the blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serologic tests for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> A, B, and C viruses were negative; <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus was undetectable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, but <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> of GB virus C was detected in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven of the patients responded to intensive immunosuppressive treatment; the three who did not respond <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> died within one year of treatment, two from complications of stem-cell or marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> does not appear to be caused by any of the known <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> viruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We recommend immunosuppressive treatment for patients who do not have an HLA-matched related donor available for bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Several features of the syndrome suggest that it is mediated by immunopathologic mechanism </plain></SENT>
