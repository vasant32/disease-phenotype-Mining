<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 37-year-old woman with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA), who had relapsed 6 years after antilymphocyte globulin therapy, was treated with intravenous recombinant human IL-3 (4 micrograms/kg/d) for 21 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, long-term therapy with subcutaneous rhIL-3 at the highest dose level tested so far (16 micrograms/kg/d) was initiated in order to maintain growth-factor response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therapy was discontinued on day 73 due to progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and increased petechial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both treatment schedules resulted in a transient increase in leukocytes (twofold) due to an increase in monocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RhIL-3 had no effect on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> values or platelet counts and only marginally improved colony formation of bone marrow CFU-GM in response to rhGM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Side effects of both treatment schedules were mild and did not exceed WHO grade II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Steady-state serum concentrations of IL-3, which are able to stimulate hematopoiesis in vitro (i.e. &gt; 1 ng/ml), were achieved by both low- and high-dose treatment, although high-dose treatment resulted in markedly higher serum levels of IL-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On measuring cytokine serum levels (neopterin, IL-1 beta, IL-6, sIL-2R, GM-CSF, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma) we noticed a different cytokine pattern with both treatment modalities, resulting in a moderate induction of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma during low-dose, intravenous treatment, whereas during subcutaneous, high-dose treatment a profound increase of IL-6, sIL-2R, and, to a lesser extent, neopterin was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results in a single patient with SAA indicate that further studies on IL-3 serum levels and IL-3-induced secondary cytokines in a larger group of patients are needed to optimize growth-factor treatment and to better understand the in vivo biological activity of IL-3 </plain></SENT>
