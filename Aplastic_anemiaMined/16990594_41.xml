<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes are heterozygous carriers for hTERC or hTERT mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These sequence variations usually lead to a compromised telomerase function by haploinsufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we provide functional characterization of an additional 8 distinct hTERT sequence variants and 5 hTERC variants that have recently been identified in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009563'>dyskeratosis</z:mp> congenita (DC) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the mutations, 2 are novel telomerase variants that were identified in our cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas most of the sequence variants modulate telomerase function by haploinsufficiency, 2 hTERC variants with sequence changes located within the template region appear to act in a dominant-negative fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inherited telomerase gene mutations, therefore, operate by various mechanisms to shorten telomere lengths, leading to limited marrow stem cell reserve and renewal capacity in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
