<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The phenotypes of lymphocytes, the ratios of Th1/Th2 and Tc1/Tc2, the levels of CD25(+) and CD4(+)CD25(+) T lymphocytes in peripheral blood of <z:mp ids='MP_0004157'>IAA</z:mp> patients were measured at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease by flow cytometry and were compared with that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The influences of those immunological indicators on prognosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0004157'>IAA</z:mp> were also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that there were 40 cases of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) and 12 cases of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of CD3(+) CD8(+) T cells in SAA group and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> group were significantly higher than those in controls (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The levels of CD3(+) and CD3(+) CD4(+) T cells in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> group were lower than that in SAA group (p &lt; 0.05), but there were no difference was compared with control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences of the levels of CD3(-)CD19(+) T cells were between the both SAA and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> groups and the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The levels of CD3(-)CD56(+) T cells in SAA group and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> groups were lower significantly than that in control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As compared to control group, the levels of Th1 and Tc1 in SAA group and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> groups increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05), and the ratios of Th1/Th2 and Tc1/Tc2 in SAA group and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> groups increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The level of Th2 increased in SAA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As compared to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> group, the levels of Th1 and Tc1 and the ratios of Th1/Th2 and Tc1/Tc2 in SAA group increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The levels of CD25(+) T lymphocyte in SAA group and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> group increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05), and were higher than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, but levels of CD4(+)CD25(+) T lymphocyte and ratio of CD4(+)CD25(+)/CD4(+) in SAA group and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> group had no significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the abnormal lymphocyte immune function exist in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of childhood <z:mp ids='MP_0004157'>IAA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The polarization of Th1/Th2 and Tc1/Tc2 shifts to Th1 and Tc1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These changes closely relate to severity of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There is high level of CD25(+) T lymphocyte in children <z:mp ids='MP_0004157'>IAA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These changes reveal that abnormality of immune function plays an important role at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of childhood idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
