<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of two different regimens with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) combined with intensified immunosuppressive therapy (IIST) in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospectively analyzed 176 SAA treated with IIST and rhG-CSF in our hospital from March 1994 to December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regimen A (Group A, n = 96), rhG-CSF 300 µg/d was initiated on day 31 after IIST and subcutaneously administered 1-3 days a week for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regimen B (Group B, n = 80), rhG-CSF was initiated at 5 µg·kg(-1)·d(-1) before IIST until hematologic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) The early response rate of Group B (67.5%) was significantly higher than that of Group A (37.5%) (P &lt; 0.01), the interval from IIST to response in Group B was shorter than that in Group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> during first 4 months after IIST were significantly reduced in Group B (6.3%) when compared with Group A (16.7%) (P = 0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of survival at 4 years in Groups B [(77.7 ± 4.9)%] was also significantly higher than that in Group A [(57.2 ± 5.1)%] (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(2) With regard to 93 refractory patients with no response 4 months after IIST, rhG-CSF therapy was continued in Group B meanwhile stopped in Group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between two groups in terms of survival and the response rates (P = 0.288, 0.066), but there was an increasing risk of evolving into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in Group B (22.3%) when compared with Group A (3.71%) (P = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(3) By multivariate analysis, the severity of disease (P = 0.010, RR = 1.922) and the early response (P &lt; 0.01, RR = 5.749) were associated with the overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the number of days of rhG-CSF therapy was the only significant risk factor for SAA evolving into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (P = 0.017, RR = 1.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The early initiation of rhG-CSF therapy with proper dose might contribute to a desirable early response and reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate, but extended administration of rhG-CSF did not improve the long-term outcome of refractory SAA and may further facilitate the progression of SAA into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
