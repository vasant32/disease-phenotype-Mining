<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The major inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes associated with development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> include Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0009563'>dyskeratosis</z:mp> congenita, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Shwachman-Diamond syndrome</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004859'>amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
