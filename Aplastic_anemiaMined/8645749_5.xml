<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After 2 years of the therapy, <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 was detected during cytogenetic analysis of his bone marrow, which evolved during a period of 5 months into <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An in vitro proliferation assay of cytokine responses showed that leukemic blasts were sensitive only to G-CSF, and not to EPO or IL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-matched unrelated donor was carried out in the non-remission stage, the patient died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0553576" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic fungal infection</z:e> on day 25, without any evidence of hematological engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As long-term use of cytokines and immunomo-suppressants in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> may induce or hasten the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e>, careful attention must be paid to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Due to the poor prognosis of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for such patients must be carried out early in the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
