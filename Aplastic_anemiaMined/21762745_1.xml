<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the frequency of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DRB1 alleles in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients from 2 genetically similar aboriginal groups, the Kadazan and the Dusun, and compared them with genetically matched community and hospital controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HLA-DRB1*15 was significantly higher in the patients compared with controls (p = 0.005), confirming similar findings in Japanese and Caucasian studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further testing indicated a significantly higher frequency of HLA-DRB1*1501 in patients compared with controls (p = 0.0004) but no significant difference in the frequency of HLA-DRB1*1502 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The high frequency of HLA-DRB1*15 in the Kadazan and Dusun population combined with the wide variety of environmental factors associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> could be the reason for the elevated incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in the Kadazan and Dusun in Sabah </plain></SENT>
