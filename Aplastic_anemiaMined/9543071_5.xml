<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264005" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Shulman's syndrome</z:e> (ShS) (eosinophilic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100537'>fasciitis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This auto-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune disease</z:e> involved not only the skin and muscles, but the bone marrow as well - thereby fulfilling the criteria of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As the disease was steroid-resistant, the patient underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Remission of ShS was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight months later <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD developed and relapse of ShS (probably induced by GVHD) occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He was successfully treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and the disappearance of GVHD was followed by cessation of the symptoms of ShS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At present (34 months following BMT) he is doing well and displays no signs of ShS or GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This case suggests that an aggressive immunoablative preparative regimen with subsequent allogeneic BMT can result in long-lasting clinical remission of a severe auto-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
