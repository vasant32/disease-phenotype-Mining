<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of these patients appeared to have <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>-syndrome with serious rheological shifts </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With AA progression the severity and frequency of hemorrhagic complications increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination revealed in 9 of 12 AA patients organic affections of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system with EEG evidence of bioelectrical shifts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In some patients neurological complications were registered prior to hemorrhagic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, to diagnose hemorrhagic complications in AA patients it is necessary to assess in details their hemocoagulation, blood rheology and neurological status </plain></SENT>
