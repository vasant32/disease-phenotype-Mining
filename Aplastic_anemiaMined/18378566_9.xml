<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Previous studies have evaluated practice variation in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) among transplant centers and countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are no studies investigating individual physician practice variation in HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An international Internet-based survey of transplant physicians collected data on medical decisions made by adult and pediatric HCT physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analyses identified practitioner and transplant center characteristics predictive of medical decision making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analysis of 526 assessable respondents showed a wide variation in management approaches to specific clinical scenarios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pediatric and adult transplant physicians differed significantly in their management strategies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>, and choice of graft source for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among adult transplant physicians, there was little agreement on the patient factors favoring reduced intensity conditioning or myeloablative conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results emphasize the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of worldwide transplant practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Local preferences or biases likely result in similar patients being offered different transplant and treatment procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The degree of practice variation also highlights the need for clinical trials to clarify areas of controversy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Where clinical trials are not feasible, data from observational studies may be the best available evidence to guide practice </plain></SENT>
