<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Korean Society of Pediatric Hematology <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> investigated retrospectively the incidence, survival, and transfusion independency according to treatment strategies in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the questionnaires were sent to members for medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We collected and analyzed 702 available data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The male and female ratio was 1.2, and the median age at diagnosis was 9.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence of Korean children with AA was 5.16 per million per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Constitutional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 44 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In acquired AA, causes were identified in 39 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Severe AA (SAA) at initial diagnosis was more common than nonsevere AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall survival was 47.8% with supportive care, 68.1% with immunosuppressive therapy (IST), and 81.8% with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In IST, response rate was 65.7%, and relapse rate after response was 54.4% within a median of 23.0 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The factors with overall survival were severity of disease in supportive care, severity and response in IST, donor type, graft failure, and posttransplant events in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term outcome in AA was dependent on treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These Korean results may help research and prospective international clinical trials for childhood AA </plain></SENT>
