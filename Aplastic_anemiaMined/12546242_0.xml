<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Wilford Hall Medical Center at Lackland Air Force Base is the only military medical center in the United States at which allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) are performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through May 2001, 367 patients, including 163 active duty service members, have received allogeneic HSCT from related donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective review of the outcomes of allogeneic HSCT in active duty members to determine what proportion was returned to full-time military service after HSCT and to delineate the factors associated with successful return to military service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one percent of service members who received allogeneic HSCT were returned to active duty at some point after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, branch of service, and rank had no significant influence on return to duty status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When adjusted for age and rank, the only significant predictor of successful return to active duty was a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although individuals with good risk diseases such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, paroxymal nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003641'>hemoglobinuria</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> in first complete remission have also been returned active duty after HSCT, these diagnoses were not statistically predictive of a return to active duty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that it may be possible to predict which service members will return to active duty after allogeneic HSCT based on the disease for which HSCT is being performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, active duty service members need not be a priori medically retired after HSCT, and each return to duty decision must be individualized </plain></SENT>
