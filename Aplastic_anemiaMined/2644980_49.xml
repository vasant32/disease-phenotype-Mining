<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight (11%) had no or only transient engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Second bone marrow transplants were successful in achieving extended survival in 16 of 27 patients with transient initial engraftment but in none of ten patients with no sign of engraftment after the first transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The major factors associated with a reduced risk of graft failure were use of radiation for pretransplant immunosuppression and use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> rather than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> or T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of the donor bone marrow for prophylaxis against graft-v-host disease (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 266 patients prepared for transplantation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> alone, the risk of graft failure was increased in patients who received previous transfusions and reduced in those who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> for previous therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither cell dose nor administration of donor buffy coat cells affected the probability of engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although use of radiation in conditioning reduced graft failure, survival was not improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Posttransplant treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and avoidance of pretransplant blood transfusions were associated with improved survival </plain></SENT>
