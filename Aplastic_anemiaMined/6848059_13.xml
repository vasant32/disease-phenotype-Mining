<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four cases of this previously unreported association are described here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A syndrome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, watery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, and generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> and tenderness occurred in close temporal relationship to development of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (less than 50 neutrophils per cu mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had received antibiotics, nor had a history of previous episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three had cultures positive for colonic organisms during the episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In only one instance was the correct diagnosis made without operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gross evidence of disease was found in the cecum, the transverse colon, and rectosigmoid in three patients, but the true extent of disease was underestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microscopic examination of the two resected specimens showed extensive mucosal and variable submucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> with invasion of the colonic wall by bacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> inflammatory changes were absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, the colon wall lacks resistance to invasion by the resident microflora </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The condition is probably best treated without operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>If first recognized at laparotomy, resection should be avoided </plain></SENT>
