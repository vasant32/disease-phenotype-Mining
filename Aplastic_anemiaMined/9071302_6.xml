<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Twelve patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and six <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers were examined with a 1.5 T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T1-weighted SE, fast STIR, and opposed-phase T1-weighted RF-spoiled GE images (op-SPGR) were acquired with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images, while <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy was performed with a stimulated echo acquisition mode without water suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three bone marrow patterns were determined in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images: marrow a with low intensity on fast STIR and high intensity on T1-weighted imaging and op-SPGR, marrow b with low intensity on T1-weighted imaging and op-SPGR and high intensity on fast STIR, and marrow c with low intensity on T1-weighted imaging and high intensity on fast STIR and op-SPGR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy quantitatively showed that the ratio of water to fat of marrow a significantly decreased (mean 0.41) and that of marrow c increased (mean 3.40) compared with those of marrow b (mean 1.09) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow (mean 1.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences of the types of fat signals between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and spectroscopy were noninvasive methods of classifying bone marrow patterns and quantifying bone marrow content in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, which may improve the results currently obtained with biopsy </plain></SENT>
