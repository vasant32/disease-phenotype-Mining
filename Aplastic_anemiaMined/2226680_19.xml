<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recombinant human EPO was administered i.v. with an initial dose of 50 U/kg body weight (BW) three times per week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dose was increased by steps of 25 or 50 U/kg bW with intervals of 1-4 weeks up to a maximum dose of 500 U/kg BW three times per week </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one patient r-HuEPO was discontinued after 20 weeks because of relapse of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No major side effects were observed even at the maximum dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> showed an increase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> from 89 to 139 g/liter that permitted monthly phlebotomies to reduce his <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In one patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> the reticulocyte count increased from 2.5 to 50 x 10(9)/liter, and the transfusion requirement decreased to 2 U every 3-4 weeks instead of every 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients did not complete the whole treatment period and showed no rise in reticulocyte count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that high dose r-HuEPO therapy is feasible in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>High-dose r-HuEPO appears to have some effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0010972'>ineffective erythropoiesis</z:hpo> in a subgroup of patients </plain></SENT>
