<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most significant variable at diagnosis was reticulocyte count, followed in order by percent bone marrow lymphocyte, red cell turnover rate, T-score severity grade, iron utilization and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> study group (AASG) severity grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reticulocyte count was the single significant variable in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three months after diagnosis, the most significant variable was still the reticulocyte count, followed by AASG severity grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes of variables during the 3 months were not correlated to prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our result reconfirmed that reticulocyte count was the most important variable related to prognosis </plain></SENT>
