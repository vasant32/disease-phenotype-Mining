<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Control patients received no <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> but were otherwise similarily treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>31 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> could be evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found between <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> treated control cases in respect to bone marrow cellularity, improvement of peripheral blood cell counts or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a group of 14 patients not being hemodialyzed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, 3 of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> treated and none of the control patients showed progressive and significant improvement of erythropoiesis; however, this was not a statistically significant difference when the both groups of patients were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results do not suggest that the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> mesterolone is of therapeutic value in the majority of adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
