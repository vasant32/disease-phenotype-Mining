<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is currently used to treat patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the use of an HLA identical sibling donor, however, the survival after BMT is reduced by the occurrence of two major immunologic complications: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs-host disease</z:e> and a long-lasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immune deficiency</z:hpo> responsible for late <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immune deficiency</z:hpo> could be explained by an imbalance of lymphocyte subpopulations reconstituted after transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present work was to study the helper function by measuring the production of interleukin 2 (IL 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This lymphokine is responsible for the amplification of the effector phase of immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A consecutive series of 34 patients was tested for IL 2 production after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This production was absent or low in 32 of 34 patients for at least 2 yr after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of this low IL 2 production was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Irradiation of patients' lymphocytes in vitro with low dose gamma-rays partially restored the IL 2 production after 6 mo of evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The IL 2 production was not restored or was slightly affected by irradiation early after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the lack of immune reconstitution after BMT may be caused by the lack of IL 2-producing cells and/or the increased activity of suppressor cells of the helper function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suppression is radiosensitive </plain></SENT>
