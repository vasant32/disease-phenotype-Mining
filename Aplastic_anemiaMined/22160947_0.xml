<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the prognostic factors for very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (VSAA) patients treated mainly with Chinese Kidney (Shen)-invigorating drugs (CKID) combined with anti-lymphocyte globulin (ALG) or anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-seven VSAA patients were treated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CSID</z:e>+ALG/ATG therapy in conjunction with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi>, hemopoietic growth factor, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship of the effectiveness and some factors (age of patients, course of illness, blood and bone marrow figures, etc.) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the 25 evaluated VSAA patients who had been followed up for over 1 year, 9 patients (36.0%) were basically cured, 5 (20.0%) remitted, 6 (24.0%) were markedly improved, and 5 (20.0%) were treated in vain, with the total effective rate of treatment being 80.0% (20/25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Better clinical therapeutic effects were shown in patients newly diagnosed with VSAA, of male sex (P=0.037), &gt;20 years old (P=0.045), with an illness course [Symbol: see text] month (P=0.048), with peripheral neutrophil count &gt;0.1 × 10(9)/L (P=0.023), and with reticulocyte count &gt;10 × 10(9)/L (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Platelet count (P=0.620) and bone marrow lymphocyte percentage (P=0.736) showed no correlation with the therapeutic effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multi-factor analysis by the Kaplan-Meier procedure on the factors influencing survival showed that rather longer survival times occurred in patients &gt; 20 years old, with peripheral neutrophil count [Symbol: see text] 0.1 × 10(9)/L, reticulocyte count [Symbol: see text]10 × 10(9)/L, and platelet count &gt; 10 × 10(9)/L (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow lymphocyte percentage and the initiation time of ALG/ATG application (from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the illness) showed no significant influence on patients' survival time (P=0.085 and P=0.935, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CSKD+ALG/ATG therapy for treatment of VSAA could enhance the current clinical therapeutic effects and elevate patients' survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conditions including male sex, age &gt;20 years, illness course [Symbol: see text]1 month, neutrophil count &gt;0.1 × 10(9)/L, and reticulocyte count &gt;10 × 10(9)/L are the likely effective indices for predicting favorable therapeutic effectiveness in newly diagnosed VSAA patients </plain></SENT>
