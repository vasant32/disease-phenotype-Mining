<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two of the patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> and 3 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Donors and patients were matched at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> HLA loci tested serologically in 29 cases; 19 of these patients had mutually non-reactive mixed leukocyte cultures (MLC's) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients had some degree of serologic mismatch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stable engraftment occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 3 evaluable patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, only two relapses have occurred, and the 1-year actuarial event-free survival for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients is 40% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 24-55%) with a follow-up of 0.8 to 2.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> survivors are out of the hospital and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> save 1 have a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> performance status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study has confirmed the utility of unrelated donors for allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although more complications are seen than with HLA-matched sibling donors, these patients did not have such donors available and virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were incurable without transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies, especially those using new methods to prevent transplant-related complications, are needed </plain></SENT>
