<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the expression of CD11a and CD49d in MNC of BM and CD11a in MNC of PB increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) after SSL/C therapy, and there was no significant change of CD49d in MNC of PB in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the decrease of CAMs of CD11a and CD49d participated in the pathogenesis of CAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of CAMs increases with effective treatment, so the restoration or improvement of altered CAMs of CAA might be beneficial to the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cell, and improvement of hematopoiesis in CAA </plain></SENT>
