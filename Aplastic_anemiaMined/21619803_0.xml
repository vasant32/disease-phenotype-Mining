<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 56 benzolism cases were divided into mild poisoning group, midrange poisoning group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> group and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases progressed bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> and smear, and counted hundred karyocytes by Wright-Giemsa tinct bone marrow smear to classification and observe the cells' feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The megakaryocytes and the extent of bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> were decreased by turns of mild poisoning group, midrange poisoning group and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The archaeocytes and juvenile cells proliferation in mild poisoning group and midrange poisoning group were inhibited and occurred cell paramorphia which related to intoxication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparing with the other groups and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> reference value, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> group's percentage of bone marrow cells in karyocytes was significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05) and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> group's percentage of bone marrow cells in karyocytes was significantly increased (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of cell paramorphia and nucleus malformation of granulocytes and red blood cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> group and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> group were increased, especially in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We saw the inhibition of archaeocytes and juvenile cells proliferation and some cell paramorphia appearances in mild poisoning and midrange poisoning cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> benzolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The abnormality changes which can be seen in bone marrow of severe benzolism cases were corresponding with the clinical classification </plain></SENT>
