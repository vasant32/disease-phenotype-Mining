<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies of their long term immunoregulatory effects, particularly in humans, have been limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the long term effects of therapy with ATG given for 2-4 weeks and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> for 2 months in 4 patients with newly diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002056'>insulin dependent diabetes</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three matched newly-diagnosed untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDD</z:e> patients and 17 healthy volunteers served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No differences in total lymphocyte count, percentage of B cells, percentage of total T cells (CD3), helper-inducer T cells (CD4) or cytotoxic-suppressor cells (CD8), lymphocyte blastogenesis assays, or pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-induced IgG secretion in T &amp; B cell co-cultures were detected before therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> following ATG administration was the only immunological defect found in the first month of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 2 months, however, patients treated with ATG and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> had diminished immunoregulatory T cell function demonstrated by production of only 28 +/- 3% IgG expected in T &amp; B co-culture, compared to 205 +/- 35% for untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDD</z:e> patients and 107 +/- 13% for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This diminished IgG production resulted from excessive suppressor function, since co-cultures of T cells from treated patients with T and B cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers suppressed the latter's IgG production by 76 +/- 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This enhanced suppressor activity persisted for 3-6 months following therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other immunological functions were not statistically different from those present at the inception of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and ATG produces long-term enhanced suppressor activity, a finding which suggests that treatment with combination ATG and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">Prednisone</z:chebi> is a rational form of immunomodulation in conditions associated with decreased suppressor function </plain></SENT>
