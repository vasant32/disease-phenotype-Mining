<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reported incidence of these diseases seems to vary between different geographic regions, and few data on their incidence are available for Latin American countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work is to determine the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Incidence study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven centers took part in the pilot phase, so as to represent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Brazilian regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Each center conducted an active search for new cases in a defined region by means of regular contacts with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hematologists, main clinical laboratories and clinicians in hospitals of the region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 74 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and 16 with <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> had a median age of 31 years (interquartile range, IQR: 12.5-48.2); 32.2% were male and 81.2% were white </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median age of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients was 21 years (IQR 15.0-35.2); 62.2% were male, 50.0% were white and 39.2% mulatto </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> was estimated to be 0.5 cases per million individuals per year, ranging from 0.0 to 1.1 cases per million per year between regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was 2.7 cases per million per year, ranging from 1.1 to 7.1 cases per million per year between regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> are <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare diseases</z:e> in Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, there is considerable variability in their incidences between different regions </plain></SENT>
