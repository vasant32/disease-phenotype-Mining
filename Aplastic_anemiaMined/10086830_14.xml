<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified epidemiologic studies, published from January 1970 to December 1995, that investigated the association of serious adverse effects with aspirin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47381">diclofenac</z:chebi>, acetaminophen, and dipyrone to determine and compare the excess mortality associated with short-term drug use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The estimated excess mortality due to community-acquired <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002531'>anaphylaxis</z:mp>, and serious upper gastrointestinal complications was 185 per 100 million for aspirin, 592 per 100 million for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47381">diclofenac</z:chebi>, 20 per 100 million for acetaminophen, and 25 per 100 million for dipyrone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The estimates were largely influenced by the excess mortality associated with upper gastrointestinal complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A relative risk estimate of 300 or more for the association of dipyrone with <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> would have been necessary for the excess mortality of dipyrone to be comparable to that of aspirin or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47381">diclofenac</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on published epidemiologic evidence used to determine the excess mortality associated with short-term use of these four <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35481">non-narcotic analgesics</z:chebi>, the current regulatory ranking of the drugs appears inappropriate </plain></SENT>
