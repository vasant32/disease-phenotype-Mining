<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is believed that clonal expansion of PIGA- blood cells is due to a survival advantage in the hostile marrow environment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated the effects of inhibitory cytokines in mice genetically engineered to have blood cells deficient in GPI-linked proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of inhibitory cytokines (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha [TNF-alpha], interferon-gamma [IFN-gamma], macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha [MIP-1alpha], and transforming growth factor-beta1 [TGF-beta1]) was investigated, using clonogenic assays, competitive repopulation, and in vivo induction of proinflammatory cytokines by double-stranded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of Fas on progenitor cells and its up-regulation by inhibitory cytokines were analyzed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, MIP-1alpha, and TGF-beta1 suppressed colony formation in a dose-dependent fashion that was similar for PIGA+ and PIGA- blood bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Competitive repopulation of bone marrow cells cultured in IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha resulted in a comparable ability of PIGA+ and PIGA- hematopoietic stem cells to reconstitute hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fas expression was minimal on PIGA+ and PIGA- progenitor cells and was up-regulated to the same extent in response to IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha as assessed by Fas antibody-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in vivo induction of proinflammatory cytokines by double-stranded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> had no effect on the proportion of circulating PIGA- blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that PIGA+ and PIGA- hematopoietic progenitor cells respond similarly to inhibitory cytokines, suggesting that other factors are responsible for the clonal expansion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
