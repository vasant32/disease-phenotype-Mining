<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical features at initial diagnosis and datas in follow up of mAA hospitalized from January 2000 to October 2011 were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) Of 153/568 (26.9%) cases of mAA at initial diagnosis, 114(74.5%)were non-severe AA (NSAA), 39(25.5%)severe AA (SAA) and 0 very severe AA (VSAA), while the proportion was 16.2%, 45.2%, and 38.6% in 376 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001897'>normocytic anemia</z:hpo> AA (nAA), and the difference is statistically significant(χ(2) = 181.390; P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age of mAA was significantly higher than that of nAA \[30(4 - 70)years vs 19 (3 - 68) years, P = 0.001\] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) There were no statistical difference in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), platelet count (PLT), response rate after 6 months treatment and overall survival (OS) between mAA and nAA grouped in SAA and NSAA respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In SAA, the reticulocyte count (Ret) of mAA was significantly higher than that of nAA \[23.90(2.99 - 61.00)×10(9)/L vs 13.1(0 - 70.60)×10(9)/L, P = 0.000\] and the proportion of erythroid cells in bone marrow of mAA was also higher \[23.5 (0 - 58) vs 14.5 (0 - 65), P = 0.043\], while they did not differ significantly in NSAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(3) The proportion of AA with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clones or abnormal cytogenetics did not differ significantly in mAA and nAA groups before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidences of AA evolved to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> in mAA and nAA was not statistically significant (7/153 vs 9/376, χ(2) = 1.099, P = 0.294) and so was the incidence of evolution to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>(3/153 vs 13/376, χ(2) = 0.399, P = 0.528) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001972'>macrocytic anemia</z:hpo> at initial diagnosis of AA, higher proportion of NSAA, elderly age, higher Ret and proportion of erythroid cells are features, but being no statistical difference in the response rate, OS, and proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> </plain></SENT>
