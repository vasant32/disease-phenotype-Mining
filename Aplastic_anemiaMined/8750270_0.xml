<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These studies have been performed mostly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report DNA-based chimerism studies in three patients transplanted for advanced CLL from a histocompatible sibling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following conditioning with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and TBI <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three successfully engrafted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One has remained in continuous complete remission (CR) with a complete donor chimerism (CDC) for 110 months post-BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another was in mixed chimerism (MC) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) at 3 months post-BMT but was in CR and in CDC at 6 months, suggesting that the persistent CLL cells has disappeared between these two studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The third patient has been in persistent MC since BMT (24 months follow-up), although he is in CR with no evidence of persistent CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We postulate that this patient's MC status is due to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> residual recipient lymphohematopoietic cells that survived the conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, various patterns of chimerism can be observed in CLL patients after BMT while remaining in CR and with no evidence of residual CLL </plain></SENT>
