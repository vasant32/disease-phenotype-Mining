<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is also a rare cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These toxicities are thought to be related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction, since <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> inhibits <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> impairment alters the synthesis of ferritin and the transferrin receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After treating K562 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> cells with a therapeutic dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> (10 microg/ml) for 4 days, there was a marked decrease in cell surface transferrin receptor expression and de novo ferritin synthesis associated with significant decreases in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> oxidase activity, ATP levels, respiratory activity, and cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Decreases in the transferrin receptor and ferritin were associated with reduced and unchanged message levels, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction alters these important proteins in iron homeostasis is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A global decrease in synthetic processes seems unlikely, since the expression of the cellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> proteins VLA4 and CD58 was not significantly decreased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi>, nor were the message levels of beta-actin or ferritin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The alterations were not accompanied by changes in binding of the iron response protein (IRP) to the iron-responsive element (IRE), although cytosolic aconitase activity was reduced by 27% in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi>-treated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A disturbance in iron homeostasis due to alterations in the transferrin receptor and ferritin may explain the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004840'>hypochromic-microcytic anemia</z:hpo> and the accumulation of nonferritin iron in the mitochondria in some individuals after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Also, these studies provide evidence of a link between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> impairment and iron metabolism in K562 cells </plain></SENT>
