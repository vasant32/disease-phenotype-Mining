<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty three (17M: 6F) patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (11 very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (VSAA) and 12 severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA), were administered antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age of patents was 8 years (range 6-12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients died within 2 months of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty children (11 SAA and 9 VSAA) were finally analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six months after the start of treatment, 8/20 (40%) patients responded-2 complete (CR) and 6 partial responses (PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the end of 1 year; 2 patients maintained CR and seven patients continued PR (overall responders 45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The response was better in SAA (54.5%) with 2 CR and 4 PR; than in VSAA (33%) with 3 PR  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eleven (55%) children were alive without response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> 13 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporin combination is an effective treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients who are ineligible for bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
