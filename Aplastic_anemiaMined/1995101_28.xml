<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty children (aged 1 to 17 years) with severe or moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were treated with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) at a dose of 400 micrograms/m2 per day administered as a 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion daily for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This treatment increased the neutrophil counts (2.7- to 28.0-fold) in 12 of the 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increasing doses (800 or 1,200 micrograms/m2 per day) were administered to five patients who had not responded to the initial dose, and three showed an increase in neutrophil count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Differential counts of bone marrow (BM) aspirates showed an increase in the myeloid/erythroid ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The response was transient, however, and the neutrophil count returned to baseline within 2 to 10 days of discontinuing treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No severe toxicity attributable to rhG-CSF was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that this agent is effective in stimulating granulopoiesis in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study also indicates that rhG-CSF will be particularly useful in managing patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> complicated by <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
