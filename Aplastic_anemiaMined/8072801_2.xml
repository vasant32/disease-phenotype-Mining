<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some differences such as a higher number of cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypocellular bone marrow</z:e> (45.6%) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between patients that developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or not, when some bone marrow parameters such as cellularity, abnormality in reticulin fibers presence of atypically located immature precursors (ALIP), quantitative and qualitative changes of erythroblastic, granulocytic and megakaryocitic series were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation either between ALIP and excess of blasts in cytology, or between FAB classification and bone marrow histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypocellular marrow</z:e> presented lower frequency of atypic megakaryocitc than patients with normo or hypercellular bone marrow and a shorter, although not statistically significant survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The survival of patients with ALIP was significantly lower than of those without ALIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> had a worse prognosis when compared to RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow histology had an important role in the differential diagnosis between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoplastic marrow</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
