<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35358">sulfonamide</z:chebi>-containing drug with commonly reported adverse effects that include electrolyte abnormalities, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000992'>photosensitivity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A few reports have described rare but serious drug complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0006515'>interstitial pneumonitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100665'>angioedema</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient who experienced a serious HCTZ-induced adverse event that, to our knowledge, has not yet been reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 78-year-old woman came to the emergency department with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> and severe <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>; her signs and symptoms were suggestive of septic shock from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She was treated accordingly, her condition improved, and she was discharged home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the next 2 months, the patient returned to the emergency department 2 more times and was hospitalized each time with the same diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During her third admission, it was discovered that the patient's primary care physician had restarted her HCTZ for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> after it had been discontinued during each of the first two hospitalizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient's symptoms began within hours of the first and second hospitalizations and almost immediately after taking a dose of HCTZ on the day of the third hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Her medical history revealed documented allergic reactions to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35358">sulfonamide</z:chebi> drugs and <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi>; thus a hypersensitivity reaction to HCTZ was suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated a probable relationship between the patient's hypersensitivity reactions and HCTZ therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because of a lack of evidence showing cross-reactivity among the different classes of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35358">sulfonamides</z:chebi>, the mechanism of the allergic reaction to HCTZ was unlikely to be cross-sensitivity between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35358">sulfonamide</z:chebi> antibiotics and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35358">sulfonamide</z:chebi> nonantibiotic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanism is not clear, evidence shows that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0869403,C0700625,C0020517" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">allergy</z:e> to the HCTZ (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35358">sulfonamide</z:chebi> nonantibiotic) may be due to a predisposition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013182" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">drug allergies</z:e> rather than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35358">sulfonamide</z:chebi> cross-sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinicians should be aware of the potential for these types of allergic reactions </plain></SENT>
