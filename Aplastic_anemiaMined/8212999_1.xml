<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Administration of rhGM-CSF resulted in a dose-dependent increase in circulating granulocyte counts, which was statistically significant in patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were no consistent changes in monocyte and lymphocyte counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although no increase in both thrombocyte and erythrocyte counts was detected in the majority of the patients, a response of both lineages to rhGM-CSF, in addition to granulocyte lineage, was observed in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Drug-associated adverse events developed in 28 patients (51%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most frequent adverse event was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In general, the treatment with rhGM-CSF was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that rhGM-CSF is effective for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and AA </plain></SENT>
