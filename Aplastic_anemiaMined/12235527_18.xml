<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> (PRCA) is a well-known although infrequent hematologic complication after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PRCA occurs in cases of major ABO-mismatch between donor and recipient and is believed to be due to inhibition of donor erythroid progenitors by residual host isohemagglutinins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a 10-year-old boy with post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) who developed PRCA after HLA-matched familial peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (SCT) following conditioning with Cph 200 mg/kg + ATG 90 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte engraftment occurred on day +18, platelet engrafted on day +40, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0001896'>reticulocytopenia</z:hpo> at 0% persisted until day +118, and erythroid precursors were totally absent from bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a single dose of rituximab 200 mg/m(2)administered on day +118 PRCA resolved and on day +132 the reticulocytes rose to 5.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On day +139 the Hb reached 137 g/l and the erythroid lineage in BM increased to 21% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that due to the rapid recovery from PRCA and lack of side effects, rituximab should be tried as first-line treatment of PRCA after allo-SCT </plain></SENT>
