<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inoculation at one day old with either IBDV or IBHV significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced levels of serum gamma-globulins at 4 weeks postinoculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This response was not elicited by inoculation of IBDV together with IBHV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Birds with experimentally induced or naturally occurring hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> syndrome (HAS) had serum proteins quantitatively and qualitatively changed from those of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum protein profiles did not coincide, however, in experimentally infected and naturally infected chickens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among naturally infected chickens, those that were IBHV-positive upon culture had significantly (P less than 0.05) lower hematocrit values </plain></SENT>
