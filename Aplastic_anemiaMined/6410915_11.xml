<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed chromosome breaks in 8 patients with Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (FA), 42 with "idiopathic" aplastic anema (AA), 15 first-degree relatives of FA patients, and 13 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their lymphocytes were treated in culture with three concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin-C</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 60-fold increase in breaks was observed in FA patients as compared to AA patients, regardless of severity of clinical signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>-stress test was standardized to clearly differentiate FA from other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenias</z:hpo> in doubtful cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, the effect of storage of <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> in solution was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data on SCEs of 12 subjects tested, 10 mo apart, showed an inverse relationship between length of storage of <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> and chromosome damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 10-month-old solution induced only one half as many SCEs as it induced at 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, the usefulness and power of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23704">diepoxybutane</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi>) in detection of FA heterozygotes was investigated in 12 first-degree relatives of patients with Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and 12 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean number of chromosome breaks per mitosis by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi> stress in obligate heterozygotes was 0.08 in comparison to 0.06 in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four of twelve control subjects showed proportions of breaks almost identical to or higher than those of FA heterozygotes, ie, 0.12, 0.10, 0.10, and 0.11 breaks per mitosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The responses of healthy controls to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi> could be separated into two groups: one with mean chromosome breaks of 0.11 per mitosis, and a second with mean breaks of 0.04 per mitosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, it appears that heterozygote detection by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi> stress of cultured lymphocytes is not unequivocal </plain></SENT>
