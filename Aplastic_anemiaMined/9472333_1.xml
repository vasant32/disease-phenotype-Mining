<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Much progress has been made in assessing the relative potency of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> metabolites but specific pathways to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> remain to be determined </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This may serve to clarify the array of metabolite effects and consequent disparate effects </plain></SENT>
