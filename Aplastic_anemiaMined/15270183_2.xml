<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the frequency of HLA DR2 status of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and their response to immunosuppressive therapy at a tertiary care hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty eight consecutive patients of acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were evaluated with respect to demographic features, severity of HLA DR2 status and response outcome to immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 24.6 years + 16.4 with a male to female ratio of 2.8:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Positivity of HLA DR2 was markedly high in acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty four (65%) out of 38 patients as compared to 45 (15%) of 300 healthy controls (p&lt;0.0001) were positive for HLA DR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Response to immunosuppressive therapy, which included antilymphocyte globulin, cyclosporin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>, was available in sixteen HLA DR2 positive patients and was found satisfactory in 12/16 (75%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HLA DR2 was significantly higher in patients with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and favourable response to immunosuppressive therapy was also associated with HLA DR2 positivity </plain></SENT>
