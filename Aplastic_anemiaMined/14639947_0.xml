<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>His liver function improved with rest, but worsened 2 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He developed a high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum level of cytokines including TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-6, and M-CSF was elevated, and hemophagocytes were seen in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_654'>hemophagocytic syndrome</z:mpath>-like state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>, gamma-globulin, and G-CSF, the high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> disappeared and the patient's liver function gradually recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow became acellular with a small number of hemophagocytes, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After immunosuppressive therapy with ATG, CyA and G-CSF was started, and the patient showed hematopoietic reconstitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio recovered to within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, and the serum cytokines including TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The increase in serum cytokines, particularly TNF-alpha and INF-gamma, as well as the presence of activated T cells associated with the preceding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_654'>hemophagocytic syndrome</z:mpath>-like state may have predisposed this patient to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
