<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-five subjects of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were treated with ATG/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALD</z:e> plus KNCM between 1992 and 2009, and the clinical data before and after treatment were collected and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 25 patients, 9 were nearly cured, 6 were improved, 5 were in remission, and 5 failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall effective rate was 80.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 3-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year survival rate were respectively 98.6%, 97.3%, 97.3%, 67.5%, and median survival time was 180 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to the conditions before administering the medication of ATG/ ALG plus KNCM, after 2 weeks, reticulocyte was first improved (P = 0.001); one month later, followed by palette (P = 0.037); two months later, by neutrophil cell in peripheral blood (P = 0.001); three months later, then by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By conducting 1-year follow-up, 1 case of complication--<z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) was identified and the patient still alive today </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ATG/ALG plus KNCM had better effect on SAA and could improve patients' survival rate </plain></SENT>
