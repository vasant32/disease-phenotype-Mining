<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intensification efforts includes addition of radiation or biologic agents such as antithymocyte globulin (ATG), procarbazine or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> has often been advocated to combat this problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With this approach engraftment rate has improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However the incidence of transplant related complications are also increased, resulting in little change in the overall outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the use of combination of fludarabine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> as a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen in a patient who was refractory to multiple <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> and transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He received peripheral blood stem cells from his HLA-identical sibling donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With a follow up of eighteen months, the patient is alive with complete and durable hematopoietic engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fludarabine-based conditioning regimen therefore has the potential to be successfully and safely used in patients with SAA undergoing transplant </plain></SENT>
