<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study asked whether the homozygous gene deletions of GSTM1 and GSTT1 affect the likelihood of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene deletions was significantly higher for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients (odds ratio [OR]: 3.1, P =.01 and OR: 3.1, P =.004, respectively) than for healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients, 17.5% (10:57) had chromosomal abnormalities at the time of diagnosis, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients with chromosomal abnormalities showed GSTT1 gene deletions (P =.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Individuals with GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene deletions may have greater susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is possible that genetic instability or chromosomal damage due to abnormal detoxification of environmental toxins might have worked as an important pathophysiologic mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> for patients with GSTT1 gene deletions </plain></SENT>
