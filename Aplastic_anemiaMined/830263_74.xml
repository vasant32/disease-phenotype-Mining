<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To explore the possible role of cell-mediated suppression of erythropoiesis in acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, we studied the effect of peripheral blood lymphocytes from seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> on erythroid-colony formation by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human bone marrow in an in vitro plasma clot-culture system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Varying numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes (0.5 to 6 X 10(5) cells) were cocultured with 6 X 10(5) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone-marrow cells in the presence of 2 IU of erythropoietin for seven days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood lymphocytes from five of the seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> caused a 79 to 94 per cent reduction of erythroid-colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, at a peripheral blood lymphocyte concentration of 2 X 10(5) cells, the numbers of erythroid colonies formed (control vs. experimental) were 374 +/- 16 (S.E.M.) vs. 22 +/- 6, 48 +/- 4, 50 +/- 16, 80 +/- 4 and 27 +/- 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> possess a population of lymphocytes capable of suppressing in vitro erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
