<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed the clinical course of patients with AA or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (neutrophil count &lt; 500/µl) for more than 25 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 46 patients, 11 with AA and 35 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients had infectious events (IE), and the cumulative incidence of IE was 30% at 6 months and 51% at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of IE was 67% at 1 year in 30 patients who experienced very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> of less than 200/µl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall survival in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 76% at 6 months and 65% at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, male sex, underlying diseases, and a neutrophil count of less than 200/µl as a time-dependent covariate significantly affected IE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In analyses that excluded patients with AA, male sex was the only factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> was significantly associated with IE in patients with AA or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and IE might be lethal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When we only considered patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the neutrophil count alone could not be used to predict the prognosis </plain></SENT>
