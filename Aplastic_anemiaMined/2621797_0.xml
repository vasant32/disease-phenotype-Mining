<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypocellularity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Granulocytes 104/microliter, reticulocytes 4,290/microliter and platelets 5,000/microliter were compatible with the diagnosis of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> based on the criteria of the Ministry of Public Welfare in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">Prednisolone</z:chebi> (PDN) was initially indicated and bolus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>, metenolone and ALG therapy followed with no hematological improvement </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a week from administration of CyA, 1 mg/kg/day of PDN was given because his <z:hpo ids='HP_0001892'>bleeding tendency</z:hpo> became worse </plain></SENT>
