<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Engraftment occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients but rejection was noted in 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mixed leukocyte culture (MLC) tests undertaken before grafting to determine donor-recipient histocompatibility were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The response of patient cells to sibling cells in mixed culture was compared to the response of patient cells to cells of an unrelated individual and expressed as a relative response index (RRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 12 patients who showed positive RRI to donor leukocytes in pregraft MLCs, 9 rejected their grafts, wheras of 23 patients with negative RRI only three rejected their grafts (P LESS THAN 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the MLC test can detect individuals who are most likely to reject their HLA identical sibling graft </plain></SENT>
