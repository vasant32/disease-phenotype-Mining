<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment failures are rare and mostly caused by graft rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increasing mixed chimerism represents a stage at the very beginning of graft rejection, where immunological intervention might be an effective prophylactic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To substantiate this, we: (1) monitored peripheral blood cells from children with SAA after allo-SCT and performed pre-emptive immunotherapy in patients with increasing MC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 23/34 courses of 32 children with SAA after allo-SCT showed a complete chimerism (CC) throughout and 10/34 developed different types of mixed chimerism (MC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Altogether, 4/10 with MC spontaneously developed decreasing MC, 2/10 courses persisted with low proportions of autologous cells below 30% (stable-MC), 4/10 developed increasing MC and one patient showed an autologous recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with CC, decreasing MC or stable MC remained in continuous complete remission (CCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 2/4 patients with increasing MC developed graft rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on these observations, 2/4 new patients with increasing MC received low-dose DLIs prophylactically, and remained in CCR without any GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results substantiate that low-dose DLI in children with SAA and increasing MC can prevent graft rejection with a calculable risk to induce severe GVHD </plain></SENT>
