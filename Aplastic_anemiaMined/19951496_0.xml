<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data of 56 consecutive children cases with SAA who had received rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (R-ATG) [3-5 mg/( kg x d) x 5 d] and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CSA) from January 2000 to June 2006 were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No repeated courses of R-ATG were given for nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients also received stanozolol or <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17272">propionate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dose of CSA was adjusted to maintain trough drug levels above 100 microg/L and peak drug levels above 300 microg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response rate to the immunosuppressive therapy (IST) was 62.5% and the complete remission rate was 37.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall survival for IST regimens was 66.27% +/- 6.84%, patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> when using ATG had significantly lower response and higher mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients whose nucleated erythrocyte population in bone marrow was &gt; or =10% had good prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients whose granulocytes population in bone marrow was &gt; or =10% had lower mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> when using ATG had significantly lower response and higher mortality </plain></SENT>
