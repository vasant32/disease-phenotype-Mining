<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Severe acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) is an uncommon disease of childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with SAA receive supportive care with transfusions and timely treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">opportunistic infections</z:e>, along with specific therapies, which may be allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) from a matched sibling or immunosuppressive therapy (IT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To report the experience in the management of SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty five children with acquired SAA were treated from July 1992 to September 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with full matched sibling donors received allogenic SCT after conditioning with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> containing regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other patients received immune suppression with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> (n= 18) plus ATG (n=17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> received supportive care until recovery of hematopoietic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those who had severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">opportunistic infections</z:e> at diagnosis or did not respond to two cycles of ATG were evaluated for unrelated donor SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven patients received sibling donor SCT and 18 IT, which was repeated in six </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients received mismatched related (1) or unrelated (2) SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients survived with a median follow up time of 4 years, 14 with full hematologic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six patients died: four due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> after IT or SCT, one due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> and one with secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> 12 years after IT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most children with SAA can be treated successfully with sibling donor SCT or IT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients without a histocompatible sibling who fail to respond to IS have a worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
