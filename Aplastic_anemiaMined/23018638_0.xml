<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Particularly intriguing are the findings that specialized assemblies of BAF complexes are required for establishing and maintaining pluripotent and multipotent states in cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known on the importance of these complexes in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and leukemic hemopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we provide the first evidence that the actin-related protein BAF53a, a subunit of BAF complexes preferentially expressed in long-term repopulating stem cells, is essential for adult hemopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conditional deletion of BAF53a resulted in multilineage BM failure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and rapid <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These severe hemopoietic defects originate from a proliferative impairment of BM <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> and progenitors and decreased progenitor survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using hemopoietic chimeras, we show that the impaired function of BAF53a-deficient <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> is cell-autonomous and independent of the BM microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Altogether, our studies highlight an unsuspected role for BAF chromatin remodeling complexes in the maintenance of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> and progenitor cell properties </plain></SENT>
