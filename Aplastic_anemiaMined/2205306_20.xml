<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nine pediatric patients (median age, 8 years; range, 0.7 to 19 years), eight with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and one with newly diagnosed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>, were enrolled in a phase I/II trial of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) administered via continuous intravenous infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Doses ranged from 8 to 32 micrograms/kg/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six of eight evaluable patients responded with a significant rise in neutrophil count (median fourfold increase; range, 2.5- to 31-fold) during the 28-day induction period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five patients completed 2 further months of therapy (maintenance) with persistent or improved neutrophil responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients had bone marrow aspirates suggestive of increased erythropoiesis, although only one patient had improvement in peripheral hematocrit and platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the five patients completing maintenance, three experienced a rapid return to baseline counts after rhGM-CSF was discontinued, one maintained a neutrophil response for 2 months after drug discontinuation, and one has maintained a trilineage response for greater than 1 year off study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Drug therapy was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was minimal at doses from 8 to 16 micrograms/kg/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>Fever</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> were more commonly seen at 32 micrograms/kg/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patient developed an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> during the course of rhGM-CSF administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that rhGM-CSF increases peripheral neutrophil counts in children with refractory and newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and may be able to stimulate a multilineage response in a more limited number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Randomized, prospective trials are necessary to determine if rhGM-CSF administration will impact favorably on the morbidity and mortality of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
