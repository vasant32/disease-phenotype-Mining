<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy revealed that small amount of microtubules were running along in the cytoplasmic bridge but mid-body was not seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma membrane about the middle of the bridge bulged to form "bulging ring" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Erythroblasts in various differentiating stages were connected by the cytoplasmic bridge and the stage of each pair was almost the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of the cytoplasmic bridge between erythroblasts was evaluated in the smear preparations of human bone marrow with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological diseases</z:e> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow, the mean value was 8.1 +/- 3.6% (n = 33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, it was 4.3 +/- 2.3% (n = 12), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, 3.2 +/- 2.1% (n = 6) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo>, 5.0 +/- 1.4% (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> the occurrence was very low showing 0.2 +/- 0.1% (n = 3) of total erythroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> (2.5 +/- 2.4%) and RA (2.9 +/- 2.2+%) showed statistically significant lower occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow the occurrence was higher, so the formation of cytoplasmic bridge could be essential for a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> proliferation of erythroblasts </plain></SENT>
