<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about other human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles affecting therapy response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated 37 Korean patients with severe AA for the association of HLA class II alleles with response to IST: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A combined with antithymocyte globulin or antilymphocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Molecular or serologic typing of HLA-DR and HLA-DQ alleles was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In responders (13/37, 35.1%), the frequency of HLA-DR15 was increased (69.2% vs 8.3%, p = 0.0002) and that of DR4 was decreased (7.7% vs 66.7%, p = 0.0007) compared with nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The response rate was significantly higher in DR15(+) than in DR15(-) (81.8% vs 15.4%, p = 0.0002) and in DR4(-) than in DR4(+) patients (60.0% vs 5.9%, p = 0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The response rates in the best (DR15(+)/DR4(-)), intermediate, and poor response groups (DR15(-)/DR4(+)) were 88.9, 38.5, and 0%, respectively (p = 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the allelic level, DRB1*1501 and closely linked DQB1*0602 were associated with a good response and DRB1*0405 and closely linked DQB1*0401 with a poor response to IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HLA-DR typing may be useful for predicting a response to IST in AA patients </plain></SENT>
