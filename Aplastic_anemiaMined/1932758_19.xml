<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> received conditioning with Cytoxan (150 mg/kg) and thoraco-abdominal irradiation (6 Gy) from an HLA-identical sibling donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 19 years (5 to 46 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine pts had less than 0.2 x 10(9)/L PMN and 53 failed to respond to previous immunosuppressive therapy before BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">Graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (22 pts), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (52 pts), or both (33 pts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 45 months (12 to 120 months), overall actuarial survival was 68% (confidence interval 95%:9.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 16 factors tested, five were shown to adversely influence survival by multivariate analysis: grade greater than or equal to 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (relative risk [RR]: 5.5), prior immunosuppressive therapy (RR: 3.5), female as donor (RR: 2.4), nonidiopathic SAA (RR: 2), and more than 0.2 x 10(9)/L PMN AA (RR: 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was the most potent factor for survival, we analysed risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, 2 of 14 factors tested were independent: male as recipient (RR: 3) and previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> of the donor (RR: 4.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On long-term follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was observed in 49 pts of 89 surviving more than 100 days (55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> before transplant (RR: 1.3) and previous history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (RR: 1.8) were associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
