<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>When human marrow cells were cultured in a medium containing alpha-medium, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi>, fetal calf serum, bovine serum albumin, erythropoietin, and leucocyte-conditioned medium, mixed colonies composed of erythrocytic cells and granulocytes were formed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clonal nature of the mixed colonies was confirmed by the linear relationship between the numbers of cells plated and the number of colonies, and the absence or presence of Y-chromatin in the mixed colonies in a co-culture experiment with male and female cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> cell culture techniques, the pluripotent hemopoietic precursors (CFUMIX) in marrow cells from 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the control subjects of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron-deficiency anemia</z:hpo>, lymphoadenitis, reactive leucocytosis or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, 8 X 10(5) marrow cells in 4 dishes produced 12.7 +/- 6.9 (mean +/- SD) mixed colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, 8 X 10(5) marrow cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> formed only 2.1 +/- 5.5 (mean +/- SD) mixed colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the marrow cells from 5 patients who were repeatedly receiving transfusions contained no CFUMIX which give rise to mixed colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present results provided the first direct evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> in most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> results from a reduced influx into the compartment of maturing hemopoietic cells from the compartment of pluripotent hemopoietic precursors </plain></SENT>
