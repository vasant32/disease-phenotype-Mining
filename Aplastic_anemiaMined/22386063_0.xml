<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We described a 7-year-old girl with reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome associated with brain parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She initially presented with high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, leading to a diagnosis of most severe type <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We treated her with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> and anti-thymocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thereafter she recurrently complained of a very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> called as thunderclap, and finally exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain imaging revealed massive parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> between the left occipital and parietal lobes on computed tomography, and diffuse cerebral vasoconstriction on magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cerebral vasoconstriction resolved within two months, and thus we diagnosed her as having reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome associated with brain parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This syndrome has been frequently reported in adult females, but rarely in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, even in children, a so called thunderclap <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> may become a clue for the diagnosis of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, especially in cases taking <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immediate magnetic resonance angiography is essential to diagnose this syndrome, and a prompt application of calcium channel inhibitors should be considered to resolve constriction of the vessels and to prevent subsequent brain damage </plain></SENT>
