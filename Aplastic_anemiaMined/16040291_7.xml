<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively studied 1,003 consecutive serum samples submitted for routine protein electrophoresis and/or immunofixation electrophoresis by CZE and FLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Samples from patients previously characterized as having M proteins were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protein electrophoresis was read by a pathologist unaware of the FLC results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen cases revealed an abnormal free kappa/lambda ratio in which CZE did not demonstrate an M protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine cases of B-lymphocyte or plasma cell proliferative processes were detected by an abnormal free kappa/lambda ratio in which CZE did not demonstrate an M protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cases with low free kappa/lambda ratios included 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), 1 IgM lambda with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and 1 lambda light chain <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cases with high free kappa/lambda ratios included 2 CLL, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo> (possibly early CLL), 1 kappa light chain <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp>, 1 atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, and 1 nonsecretory <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Addition of the free kappa/lambda ratio to CZE increases the yield of lymphocyte and plasma cell proliferative processes detected by 56% </plain></SENT>
