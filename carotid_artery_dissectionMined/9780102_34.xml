<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred forty-six consecutive patients with extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> were evaluted; 29 were studied retrospectively from 1972 to 1984 and 117 prospectively from 1985 to 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-two percent of patients (91/146) with extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> had ophthalmologic symptoms or signs that were the presenting symptoms or signs of dissection in 52% (76/146) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-four percent (65/146) had painful <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo>, which remained isolated in half the cases (32/65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight percent (41/146) had transient monocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo>, which was painful in 31 cases, associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo> in 13 cases, and described as "scintillations" or "flashing lights"-often related to postural changes or exposure to bright lights-suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> choroidal hypoperfusion in 23 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients had ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo>; one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 76 patients with ophthalmologic symptoms or signs as the presenting features of carotid dissection, a nonreversible ocular or hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> later occurred in 27, within a mean of 6.2 days (range, 1 hour to 31 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within the first week after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of neuro-ophthalmic symptoms and signs, and 24 had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within the first 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ophthalmologic symptoms or signs are frequently associated with and are often the presenting features in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Painful <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo> or transient monocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> should prompt investigations to diagnose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> and begin early treatment to prevent a devastating ocular or hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
