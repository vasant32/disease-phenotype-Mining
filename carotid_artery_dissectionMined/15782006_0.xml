<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Right carotid angiography demonstrated almost total occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) and severe stenosis of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), presumably caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Local arterial injection of urokinase was performed 2 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ICA became patent, but the M2 portion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was still occluded, and the left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> did not improve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Superficial temporal artery-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis was immediately performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> disappeared completely 6 days after this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiography 2 weeks after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> revealed occlusion of the ICA, and maintenance of blood flow to the right cerebral hemisphere via the anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging showed small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the right cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Repeat angiography after 5 months showed recanalization of the right ICA and the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combination of thrombolytic therapy and bypass surgery may be a useful treatment option for patients with sudden occlusion of the intracranial artery caused by dissection </plain></SENT>
