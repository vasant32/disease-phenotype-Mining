<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fibromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (FMD) is a significant cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001920'>renal artery stenosis</z:hpo>, especially in young females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A rare association between FMD and alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT) deficiency has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the alpha 1-AT phenotype distribution in 83 patients with renal arterial FMD with those published for Australian populations. alpha 1-AT phenotyping was performed by isoelectric focusing between pH 4.2 and pH 4.9 on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gels with PiM1M2, PiFM (non-deficiency alleles), PiMS and PiMZ (deficiency alleles) markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following phenotyping, alpha 1-AT genotyping was performed in 10 patients to confirm the presence of S and/or Z alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The phenotype distribution and allele frequencies were similar to those reported for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects from two Australian populations (72 (86.7%) PiMM phenotype, one (1.2%) PiFM, seven (8.4%) PiMS, two (2.4%) PiMZ and one (1.2%) PiSZ), suggesting that alpha 1-AT deficiency is not a common aetiological factor in renal arterial FMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, despite FMD being three times less common in males than females, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> being a rare occurrence, a male with PiMS deficiency phenotype presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> and had bilateral renal artery FMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, a patient with PiSZ deficiency phenotype was one of two sisters with FMD and was more severely affected than her PiMM <z:mp ids='MP_0002873'>normal phenotype</z:mp> sibling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These two patients from the present series together with nine culled from the literature with alpha 1-AT deficiency phenotype and FMD suggest that the chance combination of alpha 1-AT deficiency and FMD may predispose to severe manifestations of FMD </plain></SENT>
