<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>B-flow imaging (BFI), conversely, is a newer method of vascular ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy and efficacy of BFI for the diagnosis of low cervical ICA dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen consecutive patients with 18 angiographically confirmed low cervical ICA dissections and 16 nondissected ICAs were studied with BFI and color Doppler ultrasonography (CDU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with those of digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of BFI in diagnosis of low ICA dissection were 94%, 94%, 94%, 94%, and 95%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Corresponding results for CDU were 83%, 94%, 94%, 83%, and 88% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>B-flow imaging more precisely showed the intimal flap and the visualization of flow within the true and false lumens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In dissected carotid arteries, 6 intimal flaps were diagnosed with CDU, and 15 intimal flaps were diagnosed with BFI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The agreement between the observers in determining low cervical ICA dissection by BFI was found to be excellent (kappa = 0.80 for intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>; kappa = 0.93 for intimal flap) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: B-flow imaging seems to be a new reliable vascular ultrasonographic technique for evaluation of low cervical ICA dissection </plain></SENT>
