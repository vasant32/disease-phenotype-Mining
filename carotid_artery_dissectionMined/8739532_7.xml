<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During a 2-year period, 12 cases (11 males and 1 female), aged between 16 and 60 years, were submitted to our Hospital with the symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsies</z:hpo> and the suspicion of carotid dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transfemoral angiograms were done in other Institutions, while the MRI and MRA were performed in our diagnostic center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blind interpretation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and angiography images was made by two independent radiologists </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Respective sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 100% for MRI with MRA and 91.6% and 100% for conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From the analysis of this small series, we can conclude that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography in combination with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging is a reliable noninvasive method for use in diagnosis of extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
