<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A patient with cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> and a mydriatic pupil that resolved after angioplasty and stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 49-year-old woman presented with a unilateral dilated <z:hpo ids='HP_0012074'>tonic pupil</z:hpo> and transient monocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> and subsequently developed speech disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed a left cervical ICA dissection with significant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ophthalmic artery filled retrograde through external carotid artery branches and reconstituted the supraclinoid ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Computed tomographic perfusion showed significant hypoperfusion of the left hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging showed punctate boundary zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: The patient experienced pressure-dependent left hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and pressure-dependent ocular findings despite anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>She underwent uncomplicated left ICA angioplasty and stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The flow through the ophthalmic artery became anterograde </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0012074'>tonic pupil</z:hpo> returned to symmetry with the contralateral pupil, and the patient's symptoms resolved completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cervical ICA dissection can manifest with a tonic mydriatic pupil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment with angioplasty and stenting of the dissected segment can restore flow and resolve the pupillary abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A pathophysiological mechanism for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011499'>mydriasis</z:hpo> is proposed </plain></SENT>
