<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The postmortem pathological examination of cerebral blood vessels is therefore necessary to establish or confirm the presence of a dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of the described cases showed no significant underlying vascular pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we present the case of a 24-year-old women who died 5 days after admission to the hospital for a rapidly developing right-sided hemisyndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuroradiological examination had revealed ill-defined bifrontal hypodense lesions and angiographic findings were compatible with a dissection of the left extracranial internal carotid artery with embolic subocclusion of both anterior cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pathological evaluation ruled out a thromboembolic occlusion of cerebral arteries and an extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> but showed an extended dissecting process of variable age in the anterior circulation of the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dissected vessels showed pathological changes characteristic of segmental mediolytic "<z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo>" [Slavin and Gonzalez-Vitale 1976] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge this is the first report on intracranial arteries being affected by this pathologic entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our case illustrates the importance of a postmortem examination of dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Careful serial section studies of dissected intracranial arteries in young subjects should be performed and may allow for a better understanding of the vascular pathology underlying the dissection processus </plain></SENT>
