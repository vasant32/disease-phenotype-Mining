<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dissection of extracranial and intracranial vessels may lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> through thromboembolic or hemodynamic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Major blunt trauma or rapid acceleration-deceleration may cause dissection, but in patients with inherent arterial wall <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, dissection can occur spontaneously or as a result of minor neck movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cocaine use has been associated with dissection of the aortic arch and coronary and renal arteries through cocaine-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent preclinical studies have suggested, however, that cocaine may cause <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of cells in the vascular wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this article, we postulate that cocaine may cause <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of vascular endothelial and/or smooth muscle cells, thus weakening the vascular wall and resulting in a dissection-prone state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We review the literature and propose a biological basis for vasculopathy, vascular dissection, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the setting of cocaine use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further research studies on vascular cells, as well as focused analysis of human pathological material, will be important in providing evidence for or against our hypotheses </plain></SENT>
