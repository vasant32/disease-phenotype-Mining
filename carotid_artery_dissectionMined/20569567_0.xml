<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 61-year-old woman was strangled by an apron strap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She was admitted to our hospital with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>tetraparesis</z:hpo>, because of spinal cord injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the next day, her left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> aggravated and left <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>facial palsy</z:hpo> newly appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed new ischemic lesions in the right cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aortography revealed bilateral common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> or intimal flap was recognized in the right common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The right common carotid dissection was fixed with deployment of self expanding stents to prevent the aggravation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> at that time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The contralateral lesion was also treated ten days later because small ischemic lesions were newly recognized in the left hemisphere on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No new neurological deficit appeared after bilateral carotid artery stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Her <z:hpo ids='HP_0002385'>paraparesis</z:hpo> completely improved two months after the spinal cord injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Carotid artery stenting using self expanding stents was especially effective as the treatment for bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
