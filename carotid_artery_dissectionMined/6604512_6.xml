<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients had preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Carotid arteriography showed stenosis (greater than 70%) in 38 subjects and extensive ulcerated lesions in two, and two emergency patients were not studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Carotid artery dissection</z:e> and sternotomy were simultaneously performed and the patients were cannulated for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We undertook CE (22 left and 24 right) using EEG monitoring prior to CPB in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average carotid occlusion time was 25 minutes without a shunt in 23 patients and 5.5 minutes with a shunt in 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After CE, CABG was performed with an average aortic clamp time of 39 minutes and an average CPB time of 87 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The operative mortality was 5% (2/42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> or perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neurologic morbidity consisted of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in one patient, transient upper-extremity <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in two patients, and transient facial <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average length of postoperative hospitalization was ten days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Currently, patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and concomitant carotid bruits with positive noninvasive testing and arteriography should have simultaneous repair of these lesions </plain></SENT>
