<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to report our experience with endovascular treatment of internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection with the use of stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Carotid dissection is an important cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in young and middle-aged patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are some patients in whom invasive management is recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve patients (eight females, four males), mean age of 50 years (range 35-80 years) with ICA dissection, were treated with the endovascular approach during a 24-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients included in this study underwent magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over this time period, 162 patients with ICA dissections were seen at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indications for endovascular treatment were: recurrent ischemic events despite adequate <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment in seven cases, contraindication to anticoagulation in four cases, and one case with significant mismatch between diffusion and perfusion weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven dissections were spontaneous and one was traumatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The follow-up was performed clinically with Doppler ultrasound (US) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> at 6, 12, and 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Stent deployment was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> symptoms were resolved in 66.7% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patients deteriorated their neurological status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no new clinical events, stent stenosis or occlusion on 24 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results showed an excellent clinical outcome of the treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This suggests promising results with the use of endovascular treatment in selected patients </plain></SENT>
