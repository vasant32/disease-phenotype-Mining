<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The recognized incidence of extra- and intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> has increased concomitantly with the progress and development of diagnostic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, management for this condition is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report in the present study the management and long-term follow-up results of 15 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean age of the patients at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 47.8 years old, and male/female ratio was 12:3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients were considered to be traumatic dissections and the other 13 patients were spontaneous dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dissection occurred in 10 patients at the extracranial carotid artery, in 4 at the intracranial carotid artery and in 1 at the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine of 15 patients demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and 5 complained of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> or facial pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, it was not possible to identify a characteristic symptom of dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Final diagnosis of dissection was made by cerebral angiography in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serial angiography was carried out in 10 of those, and 5 of the 10 patients showed some improvements of dissection in the cerebral angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment for those patients was selected according to the neurological and angiographical changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five patients were managed conservatively and 10 patients underwent surgical revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period (mean 77.6 months), none of them showed any symptoms of reattack, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one, who died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> 193 months after revascularization surgery, have lived independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although diagnosis of dissection was difficult because of the lack of characteristic symptom, serial angiography was a useful method for diagnosis and adequate management has led to a good clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
