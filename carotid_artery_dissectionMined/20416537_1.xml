<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the relevance of 5 different imaging signs in the evaluation of carotid artery invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Between September 2001 and September 2008, 22 patients (20 men and 2 women) presented with lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> of a head and neck <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> that invaded the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients received either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> (CAD, group 1 [n = 17]) or carotid resection (group 2 [n = 5]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preoperative images using CT (n = 18) and/or MRI (n = 14) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 1 of 17 cases in group 1 and in 5 of 5 cases in group 2, encasement of more than 180 degrees of the artery was present (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Segmental obliteration of the fat between the lymph node and the carotid artery was noted in 7 of 17 cases in group 1 and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases in group 2 (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deformation of the carotid artery was reported in no cases in group 1 and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases in group 2 (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The combination of deformation of the carotid artery, encasement of more than 180 degrees of the carotid perimeter, and segmental obliteration of the fat between the <z:mp ids='MP_0000702'>adenopathy</z:mp> and the carotid artery was highly predictive of massive invasion of the carotid artery, which would require a resection en bloc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparison, the isolated existence of encasement of more than 180 degrees or segmental obliteration of fat could not strictly indicate massive invasion of the carotid artery; thus, CAD could be planned </plain></SENT>
