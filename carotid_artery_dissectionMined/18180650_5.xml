<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mainly publications of the last 3 years have been considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: The discovery of photosensitive <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> ganglion cells not serving vision, but serving circadian rhythm and the pupil initiated many studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that pupil reaction to light might be preserved even if <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rods and cones are lost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous pupillary contractions in darkness occur in sleepy subjects and have been used to quantify the state of alertness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Apraclonidine eye drops have been suggested to diagnose <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Iatrogenic cause and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> are the most frequently reported underlying causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anti-Hu antibodies may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012074'>tonic pupils</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: Pupil studies in blind patients may give new insights into the function of the pupillary system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Testing for sleepiness by means of pupillography might be used more frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Testing for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo> still needs to be done with cocaine eye drops </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluation has to be focused on detecting additional signs and symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Unknown <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> is very rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0012074'>tonic pupil</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001519" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Adie syndrome</z:e>) autoantibodies may play a role, in exceptional cases it might represent a paraneoplastic disorder </plain></SENT>
