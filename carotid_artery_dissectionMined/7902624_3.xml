<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Aortic arch dissection is usually lethal unless emergency surgery is performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The dissection rarely may have a benign outcome or may occur without pain and be revealed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is then likely to be seen primarily by a neurologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In such cases, the value of new noninvasive diagnostic testing has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 51-year-old man had a sudden left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> due to hemorrhagic capsular and caudate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on the right side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cervical ultrasound examination with color flow imaging showed a bilateral common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> extending up to the bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography showed an aortic arch dissection, involving the innominate and left common carotid artery origins, which was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and aortography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient spontaneously fully recovered and is still alive 24 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This case emphasizes the usefulness of new noninvasive techniques such as transesophageal echocardiography and color-coded Doppler echocardiography in the diagnosis and follow-up of painless dissection of aortic and common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may be underestimated </plain></SENT>
