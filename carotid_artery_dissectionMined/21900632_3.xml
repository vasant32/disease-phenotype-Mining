<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed 982 consecutive patients with CEAD included in the Cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Artery Dissection</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic Stroke</z:hpo> Patients observational study (n = 619 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> [ICAD], n = 327 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> [VAD], n = 36 with ICAD and VAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with ICAD were older (p &lt; 0.0001), more often men (p = 0.006), more frequently had a recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (odds ratio [OR] = 1.59 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-2.31]), and tended to report less often a minor neck trauma in the previous month (OR = 0.75 [0.56-1.007]) compared to patients with VAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinically, patients with ICAD more often presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> at admission (OR = 1.36 [1.01-1.84]) but less frequently complained of cervical pain (OR = 0.36 [0.27-0.48]) or had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (OR = 0.32 [0.21-0.49]) than patients with VAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among patients with CEAD who sustained an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, the NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score at admission was higher in patients with ICAD than patients with VAD (OR = 1.17 [1.12-1.22]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> was more common (OR = 1.80 [1.13-2.87]) and bilateral dissection less frequent (OR = 0.63 [0.42-0.95]) in patients with ICAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple concomitant dissections tended to cluster on the same artery type rather than involving both a vertebral and carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with ICAD had a less favorable 3-month functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score &gt;2, OR = 3.99 [2.32-6.88]), but this was no longer significant after adjusting for baseline NIHSS score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the largest published series of patients with CEAD, we observed significant differences between VAD and ICAD in terms of risk factors, baseline features, and functional outcome </plain></SENT>
