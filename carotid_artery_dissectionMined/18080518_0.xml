<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 14-year-old, previously healthy, girl developed left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> after jogging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI sh owed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the right basal ganglia and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (MRA) revealed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing of the right ICA as well as pseudolumen at the origin of the right ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She was treated with antithrombotic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up MRA demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> signal in the right ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 23-year-old woman admitted to the hospital because of minor facial injury due to a traffic accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although she had no apparent symptom, follow-up CT, one day after presentation,. showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the right basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiography showed diminished <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter of the right ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>She was treated with antithrombotic therapy and follow-up angiography showed reconstitution of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lumina of the right ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A 34-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> following swimming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and MRI did not show any ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MRA revealed diminished signal in the left ICA as well as string and pearl sign at the origin of the left ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>She was treated with antithrombotic therapy, and follow-up angiography showed normalization of the left ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Cervical ICA dissection due to trivial trauma usually appears as an eccentric tapered stenosis arising at the origin of the ICA and resolves with complete or excellent recovery in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Surgical or endovascular treatment should be reserved for patients who have persistent symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> despite adequate antithrombotic treatment </plain></SENT>
