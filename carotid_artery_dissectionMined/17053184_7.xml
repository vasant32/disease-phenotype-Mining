<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Genetic risk factors are thought to play a role in the etiology of spontaneous cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissections</z:e> (CAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, familial CAD is extremely rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we analyzed patients with familial CAD and asked the question whether familial CAD has particular features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven families with 15 CAD patients were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were carefully investigated by a neurologist, a neuroradiologist, and a dermatologist for clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From 11 patients a skin biopsy was performed to study the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the connective tissue and to analyze the coding sequences of COL3A1, COL5A1, COL5A2, and part of COL1A1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of the patients (n=15, 9 women) at their first dissection was 36.2 years (median age 32 years, range 18 to 59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients had bilateral CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient had a right and a left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> in successive weeks, another patient had 5 dissections over a period of 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A high intrafamilial correlation was found between the affected vessels (ie, the carotid and the vertebral arteries) and between ages at the first dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient we found clear and reproducible ultrastructural abnormalities in the skin biopsy, but the second patient from the family was not studied, because he died as a result of CAD before this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The dermal connective tissue aberrations in the examined patient were similar to mild findings in patients with vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> (EDS type IV), but might be iatrogenic and related to long-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> inhalation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other analyzed patients showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> connective tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In patients from 6 families we analyzed the whole coding sequence of COL3A1, COL5A1, and COL5A2, and from part of COL1A1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A missense mutation in the COL3A1 gene (leading to a G157S substitution in type III procollagen) was detected in both patients from 1e family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Two patients from another family carried a rare nonsynonymous coding polymorphism in COL5A1 (D192N); 1 of them carried also a rare variant in COL5A2 (T12337) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Familial CAD patients are young and probably are at high risk for recurrent or multiple CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural alterations of the dermal connective tissue might not be an important risk factor for familial CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, the finding of a COL3A1 mutation revealed the presence of an inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> in 1 family </plain></SENT>
