<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient with carotid dissection and ipsilateral ageusia in the anterior two thirds of the tongue, presumably from a lesion of the chorda tympani </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ageusia in carotid dissection is explained by the close anatomic relation of the internal carotid artery and the chorda tympani in the short petrous bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, since extension of the space-occupying, dissecting intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> into the carotid channel as in our patient occurs infrequently--a probable precondition for the chorda tympani lesion--loss of taste is accordingly very rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reduced perfusion of the vasa nervorum can be excluded as another cause, because the chorda tympani is supplied only from branches of the external carotid artery </plain></SENT>
