<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the right internal carotid artery was found in a 22-year-old man, who rapidly became unconscious and hemiparetic after an accident occurring during sport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The dissection was limited to the intima and internal elastic lamina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patterns of cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> with mucoid degeneration were present in the right internal carotid artery proximal to the site of dissection, in the thoracic aorta, and in several visceral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the region of the right internal carotid artery affected with cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, calcification and also splitting of the internal elastic lamina was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such calcification was also present at the site of the dissection, at the tip of the ruptured and recoiled elastic lamina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These changes, dissection as well as cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, were associated with an elevated elastase content, a decrease of desmin and an increase of vimentin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructurally, in areas affected by cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> a corresponding transformation of medial smooth muscle <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> from the contractile to the metabolic state was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The topographical relation of dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, and an increased elastase content is suggestive of a causal relation, and the possibility of common etiological factors is discussed </plain></SENT>
