<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An animal model for ICA dissection has not been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>New Zealand White rabbits were anaesthetized and surgical microdissection performed to expose the right internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A small arteriotomy was performed and a subadventitial plane of dissection created using blunt dissection and injected heparinized saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The adventitia was sutured and the animals were recovered after closure of the wound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The procedure was repeated on the left ICA after 7 days with removal of the left ICA for control samples and removal of the right ICA to obtain sample specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The brain was also removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 11 control specimens and 9 sample specimens were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean length of these specimens (n = 20) was 5.5 mm (range 5-6 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean length of dissection of the control specimens (n = 11) was 2.2 mm (range 2-3 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean length of dissection on sample specimens (n = 9) was 2 mm (range 1-3 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no extension of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no intraluminal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This model was able to induce arterial wall dissection in a rabbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was no extension of the induced dissection over 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No local arterial or cerebral ischemic complications developed from the dissection </plain></SENT>
