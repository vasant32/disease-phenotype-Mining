<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: No randomized study has yet compared efficacy and safety of aspirin and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> in patients with spontaneous dissection of the cervical carotid artery (sICAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospectively collected data from 298 consecutive patients with sICAD (56% men; mean age 46 +/- 10 years) treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> alone (n = 202) or aspirin alone (n = 96) were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Admission diagnosis was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in 165, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> in 37, <z:mp ids='MP_0006190'>retinal ischemia</z:mp> in 8, and local symptoms and signs (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, neck pain, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsy</z:hpo>) in 80 patients, while 8 patients were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up was obtained after 3 months by neurologic examination (97% of patients) or structured telephone interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were 1) new cerebral ischemic events, defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, or <z:mp ids='MP_0006190'>retinal ischemia</z:mp>, 2) symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and 3) major extracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During follow-up, ischemic events were rare (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, 0.3%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, 3.4%; <z:mp ids='MP_0006190'>retinal ischemia</z:mp>, 1%); their frequency did not significantly differ between patients treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (5.9%) and those treated with aspirin (2.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same was true for hemorrhagic adverse events (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, 2%; aspirin, 1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>New ischemic events were significantly more frequent in patients with ischemic events at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (6.2%) than in patients with local symptoms or asymptomatic patients (1.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of a nonrandomized study, our data suggest that frequency of new cerebral and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> ischemic events in patients with spontaneous dissection of the cervical carotid artery is low and probably independent of the type of antithrombotic treatment (aspirin or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
