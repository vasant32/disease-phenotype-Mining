<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assessed the safety and efficacy of endovascular stent angioplasty in the treatment of SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven consecutive patients with SCD underwent endovascular stent angioplasty of a total of 12 vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indications included the presence of a large or enlarging pseudoaneurysm, a contraindication to anticoagulation, failure of anticoagulation, and compromised cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five patients had fibromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients tolerated the procedure well, with no adverse clinical events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed symptomatic improvement on clinical follow-up except for one patient, who had hemorrhagic conversion of a pre-existing large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> 13 days after intervention; he made an eventual recovery to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> stents have remained patent on radiologic follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides additional evidence that endovascular stent angioplasty is a safe and effective treatment for SCD in patients for whom medical treatment is not adequate </plain></SENT>
