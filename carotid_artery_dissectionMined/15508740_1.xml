<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recurrence of spontaneous cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection is not rare (1%/year) but bilateral recurrence affecting the same cervical ICA is rare, especially after a 12-year-interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 41-year-old man exhibited left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and angiography revealed tapered stenosis of his right cervical ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within 2 days, his <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 21 days, repeated angiography showed complete resolution of the once-stenosed right cervical ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He was discharged with slight left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The follow-up angiography performed after 18 months disclosed not only the recanalization of the right cervical ICA but also a new concentric stenosis of his left cervical ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since he presented no new neurological deficit, he was treated with an antiplatelet agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The angiography performed 14 months later revealed normalization of bilateral cervical ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 12 years, at the age of 53, he presented with worsening of his left motor <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also on this occasion, angiography revealed bilateral cervical ICA dissection and their spontaneous resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The anamnesis revealed that he had experienced the same ischemic symptoms, that is, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> and their spontaneous resolution, when he was 24 and 37 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These 4 episodes had some characteristics in common: occurrence in winter (from December to March), being preceded by moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and upper <z:hpo ids='HP_0011947'>respiratory tract infection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of spontaneous cervical ICA dissection is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>From experience with this patient, we propose that the occurrence of spontaneous cervical ICA dissection might depend on a genetic predisposition and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> might play the role of a trigger </plain></SENT>
