<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The early diagnosis of traumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> (TICAD) is essential for initiating appropriate treatment and improving outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We searched for criteria from transcranial Doppler (TCD) measurements on admission that could be associated with subsequent TICAD diagnosis in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective 1:4 matched (age, mean arterial blood pressure) cohort study of 11 TBI patients with TICAD and absent or mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> on initial CT scan, 22 TBI controls with comparable brain CT scan lesions (controls 1), and 22 TBI controls with more severe brain CT scan lesions (controls 2) on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TCD measurements were obtained on admission from both middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had subsequent CT angiography to diagnose TICAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A &gt;25% asymmetry in the systolic blood flow velocity between the two <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was found in 9/11 patients with TICAD versus 0/22 in controls 1 and 5/22 in controls 2 (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combination of this asymmetry with an ipsilateral pulsatility index &lt; or =0.80 was found in 9/11 patients with TICAD versus none in the two groups of controls (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that significant asymmetry in the systolic blood flow velocity between the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> and a reduced ipsilateral pulsatility index could be criteria from TCD measurements associated with the occurrence of TICAD in head-injured patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If prospectively validated, these findings could be incorporated in screening protocols for TICAD in patients with TBI </plain></SENT>
