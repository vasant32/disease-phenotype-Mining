<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A subject with dissection of the internal carotid artery (ICA) may present with a variety of symptoms, from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus far, it has not been possible to identify the subset of patients at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because the majority of these ischemic events are secondary to embolic phenomena, we used transcranial Doppler (TCD) evaluation with emboli monitoring to study 17 consecutive patients with ICA dissection treated at Harborview Medical Center, Seattle, Wash, during a 2-year period from 1992 until 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients with ICA dissection secondary to trauma and seven with spontaneous ICA dissection were diagnosed by carotid angiography and studied by TCD from the time of diagnosis through initiation of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Emboli monitoring was performed in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) ipsilateral to the dissection at the initial evaluation and intermittently thereafter to ensure that the emboli stopped with treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Emboli were detected in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> distal to the dissection in 10 of 17 patients (59%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with microemboli detected by TCD presented with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (70%) much more frequently than those without emboli (14%) (P=.0498) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of a pseudoaneurysm did not increase the risk of either microemboli or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated a high incidence of intracranial microemboli in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> distal to carotid dissections and a significant correlation between the presence of emboli and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TCD can therefore be used as an adjunctive tool to manage patients with suspected carotid dissection and may prove useful in evaluating the efficacy of treatment in reducing microemboli and subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
