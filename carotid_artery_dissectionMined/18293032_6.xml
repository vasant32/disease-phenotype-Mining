<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We encountered seven patients with symptomatic extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e>, three cases of which occurred after carotid endarterectomy, two after carotid angioplasty and stenting, and two after trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Balloon-expandable and self-expanding stents were placed using a transfemoral approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Success in restoring the carotid lumen was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No procedure-related complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients experienced significant clinical improvement while in the hospital and achieved complete long-term recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At follow-up (mean, 22.4 months), good <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> patency of the stented segments was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in this small series, primary stent-supported angioplasty seems to be a safe and effective strategy in the treatment of selected patients having <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> traumatic extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e>, with excellent early and midterm results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Larger series and longer-term follow-up are required before definitive recommendations can be made </plain></SENT>
