<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dissection of the carotid artery can, in certain cases, lead to significant stenosis, occlusion, or pseudoaneurysm formation, with subsequent hemodynamic and embolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, despite <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the therapeutic value of stent-supported angioplasty retrospectively in this subset of patients who are poor candidates for medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five men and five women (age range, 37-83 years; mean age, 51.2 years) with dissection of the internal (n=9) and common (n=1) carotid artery were successfully treated with percutaneous endovascular balloon angioplasty and stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The etiology was spontaneous in five, iatrogenic in three, and traumatic in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven of the treated lesions were left-sided and three were right-sided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The treatment significantly improved dissection-related stenosis from 74+/-5.5% to 5.5+/-2.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two occlusive dissections were successfully recanalized using microcatheter techniques during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple overlapping stents were needed in four patients to eliminate the inflow zone and false lumen and establish an angiographically smooth outline within the true lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was one case of retroperitoneal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, but there were no procedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>), minor or major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome at latest follow-up (16.5+/-1.9 months) showed significant improvements compared with pretreatment modified Rankin score (0.7+/-0.3 vs 1.8+/-0.44) and Barthel index (99.5+/-0.5 vs 80.5+/-8.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in a treated patient with contralateral carotid occlusion following a hypotensive <z:mp ids='MP_0004898'>uterine hemorrhage</z:mp> at 8 months; the remaining nine patients have remained free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In select cases of carotid dissection associated with critical hemodynamic insufficiency or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> that occur despite medical therapy, endovascular stent placement appears to be a safe and effective method of restoring vessel lumen integrity, with good clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
