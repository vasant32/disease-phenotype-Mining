<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> (CCAD) is associated with anatomic characteristics of the styloid process of the temporal bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CT angiograms from 38 case patients with CCAD and 38 age- and sex-matched control subjects without dissection were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Styloid process length, angulation in the axial and rostral-caudal planes, and proximity to the carotid artery were measured bilaterally by raters blinded to radiology reports and clinical information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In control subjects, there was substantial variation in styloid process length (range 4.6-42.9 mm), medial angulation (range 16-89°), caudal angulation (range 31-80°), and proximity to the carotid (range 0.7-15.4 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control subjects also demonstrated marked symmetry between sides (correlation coefficients 0.80 for length, 0.34 for proximity, 0.81 for medial angulation, and 0.87 for caudal angulation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In case patients, the mean styloid length on the side of the dissection was not significantly longer than that on the contralateral side (mean 30.3 vs 29.7 mm, p = 0.30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The styloid process was significantly longer ipsilateral to the dissection in case patients compared with the side-matched process in control subjects (mean 30.3 vs 26.6 mm, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Carotid dissection was associated with increasing styloid process length (OR [OR] 1.08/mm, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.002-1.17, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The OR of dissection in the highest quartile of length compared with that in the lower 3 quartiles was 4.0 (95% CI 1.3-14.2, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CCAD is associated with a longer styloid process, suggesting that mechanical injury from the styloid may contribute to the pathogenesis of CCAD </plain></SENT>
