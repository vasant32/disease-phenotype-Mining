<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Standard transfemoral cervical carotid and cerebral angiography was the principal diagnostic modality used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The angiographic results were compared to the CT images and to the gross and microscopic endarterectomy pathological specimens, when available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Examples of the various types of abnormalities that can be visualized using CT scans are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CT scan was useful for determining the presence of degenerative atheromatous changes including carotid artery calcification, subintimal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, carotid occlusion, carotid segmental occlusion, and carotid pseudoocclusion, as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The scans were particularly useful for identification of atheromatous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> when the carotid angiogram appeared nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and for identifying the cause of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CT scanning allows visualization of the carotid artery wall and lumen rather than just the lumen and, consequently, can sometimes add helpful information about the pathological processes affecting this artery </plain></SENT>
