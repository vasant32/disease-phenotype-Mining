<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTIONS: An anesthetist stretched the neck of a 44-year-old man by anchoring an anesthesia mask posterior to the angle of the jaw with overlying fingers as the patient struggled during an insufficient inhalational mask <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 33-year-old man received an endotracheal <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> without struggle, but as he was turned from a supine to a prone position, his head and neck were not immobilized to rotate with his torso during the move </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The next day both patients suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> secondary to ICA dissections and occlusions (angiographically demonstrated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stretching the soft neck tissues of anesthetized patients can cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
