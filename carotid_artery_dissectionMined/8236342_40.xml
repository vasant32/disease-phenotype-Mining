<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissections</z:e> are diagnosed with an increasing frequency, but reliable epidemiologic data are not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the incidence rate of spontaneous cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> in a defined population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using the medical record linkage system used for epidemiologic studies in Rochester, Minn, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with spontaneous cervical ICA dissection for 1987 through 1992 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 10 patients with spontaneous cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> (6 women and 4 men; mean age, 44 years) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the period 1987 through 1992, the average annual incidence rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages was 2.6 per 100,000 (95% confidence intervals, 0.9 to 4.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study, for the first time, provides incidence rates for spontaneous cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No diagnoses were made before 1987, probably reflecting an increased awareness of the disorder among physicians </plain></SENT>
