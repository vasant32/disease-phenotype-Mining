<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> developed during extracranial ICA dissection are detected angiographically in 5 to 40% of cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical and radiologic course of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> is not known, and it is not known how they should be treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-eight consecutive patients with extracranial ICA dissection were reviewed, and those with radiographically detectable dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage or during early follow-up were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had regular clinical and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (27.5%) with a total of 20 ICA dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were followed for a mean period of 36.9+/-21 months (range, 10 to 93 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No clinical symptoms suggestive of aneurysmal rupture or embolization from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extracranial ICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> remained unchanged in 65% of patients, were resolved in 5% of patients, and decreased in size in 30% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clinical course of dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was benign, although spontaneous radiologic resolution occurred rarely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Medical management with antiplatelet therapy alone (after early anticoagulation) is generally sufficient, and surgical management was seldom required </plain></SENT>
