<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes of endovascular carotid repair with regard to vessel patency and retreatment rates.METHODS AND METHODS:We retrospectively reviewed records of patients who underwent endovascular treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> traumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> with or without pseudoaneurysm formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Biffl classification of blunt carotid arterial injuries with an additional modification to stratify grade 2 and 3 injuries into no-flow-limiting (2a/3a) and flow-limiting (2b/3b) was used to classify injuries.RESULTS:Forty-seven patients underwent 50 endovascular interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-four were treated with stents alone, 4 required both stent and coil treatments, and 2 were treated with coils alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initial treatment resulted in complete restoration of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vessel lumen diameter in 25 (50%) treated vessels and good-to-acceptable restoration in 25 (50%) vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A single patient had complete stent occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients required stent and/or coil retreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no mortality or permanent morbidity relating to endovascular carotid artery repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients initially treated with medical management ultimately required endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eighteen (87.5%) of these injuries were initially classified as grade 3a and 3 (14.3%) were initially grade 2a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Injury progression necessitating treatment was identified, on average, within 5 weeks of the initial injury.CONCLUSIONS:In our series, endovascular therapy was a safe and effective option for restoring <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> caliber and eliminating flow within pseudoaneurysms related to traumatic injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Imaging follow-up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cervicocerebral vascular injuries is especially important within the first 45 days, a critical interval during which most lesions demonstrate healing or progression </plain></SENT>
