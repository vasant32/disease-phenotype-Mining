<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo> without associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsies</z:hpo> or ischemic symptoms is an important presentation of spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> (sICAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound is often used as a screening method in these patients because cervical MRI is not always available on an emergency basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Current knowledge on ultrasound findings in patients with sICAD presenting with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo> is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were recruited from prospective cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e> databases of 3 tertiary care centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of sICAD was confirmed by cervical MRI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography or digital subtraction angiography in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data on Doppler sonography and color duplex sonography examinations performed within 30 days of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 88 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo> as the only sign of sICAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Initial ultrasound examination was performed in 72 patients after a mean time interval from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to examination of 11 (SD 8) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall frequency of false-negative ultrasound findings was 31% (22 of 72 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It showed stenosis &gt;or=80% or occlusion in 34 (47%) patients, and stenosis &lt;or=80% in 16 (22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It visualized mural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> in 7 patients and intimal flap in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ultrasound were less frequently smokers (9% versus 28%, P=0.034), and had less frequently <z:hpo ids='HP_0002083'>migraine without aura</z:hpo> (9% versus 43%, P=0.012) or neck pain (18% versus 62%, P=0.003) than those with pathological ultrasound findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one third of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo> as the only sign of sICAD presented with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ultrasound findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that ultrasound is not a reliable method to diagnose sICAD in patients with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
