<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A series of 33 consecutive patients (mean age, 40.21 years; 29 men and 4 women) who underwent angioplasty and stent placement for symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> (sCAD) from May 2005 to December 2010 in the Nanjing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Registry Program (NSRP) was retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the included patients had been diagnosed definitively based on catheter angiography, and had failed to respond to medical therapy during the course of initial hospital admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The baseline and followed up data of these patients were collected and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 33 included patients, 32 patients had achieved technical success without any intraoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients manifested ipsilateral Horner sign on the next day after stenting, and one of them suffered from recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) during the course of follow up, but completely remission via antithrombotic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endovascular stenting is a feasible and safe therapeutic strategy of CAD patients who have failed medical therapy </plain></SENT>
