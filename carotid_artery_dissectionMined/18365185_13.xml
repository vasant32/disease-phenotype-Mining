<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: We report our experience with endovascular treatment (EVT) of circumferential and fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> by a reconstructive approach with self-expandable stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of our prospectively maintained database identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> circumferential and fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated by a reconstructive endovascular approach over a 3-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical charts, procedural data, and angiographic results were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From April 2004 to May 2007, 13 patients were identified, of whom 12 were asymptomatic and 1 presented with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> &lt;or=2 mm were treated by stent-within-stent placement without coiling (group 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 11 patients with a larger <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, stenting with subsequent coiling was performed (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this latter approach, a balloon was temporarily inflated within the stent to ensure safe coil delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed an excellent clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic procedural complications occurred in three patients, two with cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> and one with retroperitoneal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients of group 1, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> had completely disappeared at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients of group 2, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occlusion was complete in three and incomplete in eight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Follow-up angiography in 12 patients showed four with further <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, six with stable results, and two with minor recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Circumferential and fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> may be treated by a reconstructive endovascular approach with self-expandable stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, a stent-within-stent technique is effective, whereas stenting and subsequent coiling is indicated in larger <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This therapeutic protocol is associated with good clinical and anatomical results </plain></SENT>
