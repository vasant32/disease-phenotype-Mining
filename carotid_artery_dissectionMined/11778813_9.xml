<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To highlight that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> is a common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo> and that it is important to diagnose dissection as anticoagulation can prevent carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five case reports are presented of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo> secondary to carotid dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient had carotid dissection secondary to trauma, two had spontaneous dissections and two had dissections in the settings of other illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A literature search was performed on carotid dissection as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo> and its diagnosis and management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The case reports and literature highlight that dissection is under-recognized as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo> and can be missed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The investigation of choice is a magnetic resonance imaging and angiography scan of the head and neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The treatment advocated is anticoagulation for 3-6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Carotid dissection should be suspected in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo>, particularly if head or neck pain is present </plain></SENT>
