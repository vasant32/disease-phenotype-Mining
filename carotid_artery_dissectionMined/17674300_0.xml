<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rapid diagnosis and proper treatments are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 48-year-old woman presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> and pulsating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> of the left ear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An angiography showed a carotid cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> (CCF) and dissection of the extra-cranial internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To treat the dissection, a self-expanding endovascular stent was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She has been followed for 6 years without any event and the ICA is patent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prompt diagnosis without delay and intimate follow-up is the key for the treatment of a carotid injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those patients who exhibit cervical bruits and/or seat-belt signs should be examined aggressively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty with stents is amenable for patients with traumatic carotid dissections requiring vascular reconstruction in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
