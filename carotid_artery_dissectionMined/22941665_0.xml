<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A male patient, presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000622'>blurred vision</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and numbness of the right side of his body, was diagnosed with common carotid artery (CCA) dissection and severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery and CCA by digital subtraction arteriography and color Doppler ultrasonography (CDU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two stents were separately implanted into the left internal carotid artery and CCA to restore blood flow and seal the opening of the dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> inside the CCA dissection was transcutaneously aspirated under CDU guidance after thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three days after the operation, the dissection was still sealed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient was discharged 1 week later without any signs or symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up examination at 70 days confirmed complete healing of the CCA dissection </plain></SENT>
