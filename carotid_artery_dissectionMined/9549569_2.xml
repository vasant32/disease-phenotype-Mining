<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He did not suffer symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, or during the following 2 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo> persisted unchanged throughout follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial magnetic resonance angiograms showed some regression of the focal stenosis at 12 mo, with no further change over the next 10 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The literature suggests that the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of dissection is usually in the first month, and the risk of recurrence of dissection is about 1% per year after the first year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our patient was prescribed aspirin 300 mg.d-1, and certified to fly as or with a co-pilot commencing 1 yr after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of his symptoms </plain></SENT>
