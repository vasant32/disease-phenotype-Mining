<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Non-invasive diagnostic devices (ultrasound, nuclear magnetic resonance) have greatly improved the ability to suspect and identify it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our clinical experience with 5 patients affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> and 2 patients affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vessel dissection generally occurred spontaneously; it was preceded by head or cervical trauma in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was commonly associated, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was always present together with other focal neurological signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical suspicion was confirmed by ultrasound duplex scanning: although never conclusive, it always showed typical Doppler patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nuclear magnetic resonance has become an acknowledged means of definitive diagnosis although angiography remains the gold standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In any case, diagnosis requires clinical suspicion and the accurate correlation of clinical data and instrumental results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therapy consisted in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and antiplatelet drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinical course of our patients was favorable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, and no recurrences were recorded </plain></SENT>
