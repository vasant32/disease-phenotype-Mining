<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become generally accepted as a non-invasive method to provide the definitive diagnosis of cervicocerebral vessel dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The finding of an intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> on axial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images is the characteristic sign of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there has been no previous report of the characteristic magnetic resonance angiographic (MRA) findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The authors retrospectively reviewed MRI and MRA findings of patients with spontaneous extracranial carotid dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most striking finding on MRA was the straightness of the affected artery when compared to the non-affected side of the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For quantitative measurement, "Carotid Straightness Index (CSI)" was developed to measure the straightness of the arteries and compared the indices of both extracranial internal carotid arteries in the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients' age range was from 21-55 years (mean 38 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 6 males and 3 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had the classical "Straight artery sign" on the MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The carotid straightness index was significantly higher in the affected artery when compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> side of the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The straight artery sign and the carotid straightness index can be very useful for early detection of the extracranial carotid dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It can be found in early stage disease or in less severe forms of carotid dissection where significant narrowing is not demonstrated </plain></SENT>
