<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e> is an important cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, particularly in young patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis can be made with invasive catheter angiography or non-invasive imaging, either with MRI in conjunction with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (MRA) or CT angiography (CTA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both modalities have been shown to have a high specificity and sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>New developments such as multi-slice CTA (MSCTA) are emerging as an alternative methods for imaging the cervical and intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the contribution of modern MSCTA to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We present a retrospective series of seven patients in whom both MSCTA and cervical axial T1 MRI and MRA were performed in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> setting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Carotid artery dissection</z:e> was identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven patients by MSCTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combination of MRI and MRA identified dissection in five of the seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a pseudoaneurysm was identified by MSCTA that was missed by MRI and MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm that MSCTA is a complementary technique in comparison to cervical axial T1 MRI and cervical MRA for diagnosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e>, and at times may provide additional information that can impact patient management </plain></SENT>
