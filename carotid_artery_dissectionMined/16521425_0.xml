<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Color Doppler sonography of the internal carotid artery with transcranial duplex sonography showed decreased blood flow velocity and increased impedance of flow in the left internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flow velocity in the left middle cerebral artery was moderately decreased whereas flow in the proximal segment of the anterior cerebral artery and in the posterior communicans artery was re-directed towards the left internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings indicated the need for cerebral angiography which revealed that a vast section of the distal segment of the left internal carotid artery was dissected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological treatment with low molecule heparine brought prompt resolution of the signs and symptoms as well as normalization of the blood flow parameters, as examined with Doppler ultrasonography Color Doppler ultrasonography would appear to have high utility in the initial diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> and the usefulness of this method in the monitoring of treatment </plain></SENT>
