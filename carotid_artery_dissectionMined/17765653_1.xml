<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aortic branch occlusion occurs in up to one third of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and is associated with increased risk for early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and serious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 67-year-old man without history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> was referred to our center for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> aortic type A dissection and was treated with a 28-mm Vasculteck prosthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the early postoperative period, he felt left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, and an angio-computed tomography showed a progression of the dissection to the right common carotid artery and left brachiocephalic trunk: the abdominal aorta with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">celiac</z:e> trunk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We felt that the patient should receive conservative management, except for the carotid involvement, for which an endovascular approach was planned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After carefully engaging the carotid ostia with a modified no-touch technique, a self-expandable stent and a balloon-expandable stent were deployed to seal the left common and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e>, whereas two self-expandable stents were implanted within the right internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiographic control demonstrated complete sealing of the carotid dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient recovered quickly after the intervention and was discharged after 2 days without any neurologic or vascular complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient did extremely well at two 3-month follow-ups, and coverage of the descending thoracic aorta dissection was scheduled to be performed in the next 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This case suggests that endovascular techniques may offer a reliable and effective answer to extended dissections, helping decrease the risk for neurologic or visceral complications and reducing the operative risk for further complete surgical or endovascular aortic repair </plain></SENT>
