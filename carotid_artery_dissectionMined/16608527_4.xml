<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissections</z:e> have been rarely reported in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis has traditionally been confirmed by catheter arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More recently diagnosis has been made by magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography; however the sensitivity of these techniques has yet to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors are unaware of reports of carotid dissection confirmed by dynamic computed tomography (computerized tomographic arteriography) in the young </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: We recently evaluated a fourteen year-old male following the development of transient neurologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no antecedent illness or trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dynamic computed tomography revealed an intracranial dissection involving the supraclinoid segment of the left internal carotid artery (confirmed by catheter arteriography) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Studies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, pro-thrombotic states, and defects of collagen were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> is a potential cause of transient neurological symptoms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the pediatric population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dynamic computed tomography appears to be a reliable diagnostic tool which can lead to early diagnosis </plain></SENT>
