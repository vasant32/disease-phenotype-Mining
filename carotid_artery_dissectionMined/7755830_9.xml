<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two cases of blunt trauma resulting in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial recognition by clinicians is often difficult because of the diverse clinical manifestations, the delay in presentation, and the associated multi-organ system injuries that accompany <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because the diagnosis of carotid injury is rarely suspected in patients with neurological deficits, the first diagnostic test performed is usually computed tomography (CT) of the head </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography should be strongly considered when the following occur: (a) Neurologic deficits are incompatible with CT findings; (b) there is monoparesis or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mental status examination; (c) there is severe cervical trauma with an abnormal neurological exam; or (d) a basilar skull fracture is present in a patient with an abnormal mental status exam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Once diagnosed, the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> is complex and no generalized guidelines have been established </plain></SENT>
