<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Carotid stenting with or without angioplasty is usually the preferred treatment for symptomatic patients who have failed medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a case of a symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> at the petrous segment of the ICA initially treated conservatively with anticoagulation and antiplatlet agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Due to early clinical deterioration from near complete carotid occlusion without adequate cross over flow, the patient underwent emergency stenting of the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Post procedure angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis of the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient progressively improved and at six months followup, the patient had no further symptoms, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neurological examination and improvement in the imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The successful clinical result in our case of ICA stenting for dissection as a 'hemispheric rescue' contributes to the growing literature of endovascular management of carotid dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The excellent mid term follow-up confirms the efficacy of this treatment for a dominant ICA </plain></SENT>
