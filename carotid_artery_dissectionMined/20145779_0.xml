<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Laboratory studies confirm that constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) improves upper-extremity (UE) function after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to strict patient criteria and the intensive resources required, CIMT has been slow to become part of rehabilitation practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of an adapted experimental protocol within an outpatient clinical setting for a patient with moderate to severe UE impairment who did not meet traditional CIMT criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT DESCRIPTION: AJ, a 16-year-old male, experienced a left middle cerebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> one year before beginning CIMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He demonstrated some proximal movement but no wrist or finger extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He had received intensive rehabilitation for 12 months prior to beginning CIMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Two occupational therapists and two physiotherapists collaborated to provide CIMT task training for 6 hours daily for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A knitted mitten extending to the elbow restrained the less-involved UE during 90% of waking hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tasks were tailored to AJ's interests, with the goal of integrating his affected UE into his behavioural repertoire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MEASURES AND OUTCOMES: After 2 weeks of CIMT, AJ improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measures (grip and lateral pinch strength, Action Research Arm Test [ARAT], and Box and Block Test) except the Chedoke McMaster Impairment Inventory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Greatest gains were seen at 6 months in the ARAT and Box and Block Test, which coincided with patient and family reports of AJ's using his arm in everyday functional tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS: Shared workload, emphasis on relevant functional tasks, and complete family participation likely influenced the success of CIMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the strict CIMT criteria used in previous studies may exclude patients who might benefit from the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Controlled trials should be undertaken to examine the effects of CIMT in patients with moderate to severe UE impairment </plain></SENT>
