<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, hospital-based analysis on the prognostic factors and association of CAD with vascular risk factors in 301 consecutive Finnish patients, diagnosed from 1994 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two thirds of the patients were men (68%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Women were younger than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>Migraine</z:hpo> (36% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients), especially with visual aura (63% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> migraineurs), and smoking were more common in patients with CAD compared with the general Finnish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, 247 (83%) patients reached a favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of the dissected artery, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> (ICAD), and recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in infarction patients were associated with a poorer outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ICAD patients had less often <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, but the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> they had were more severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven (2.3%) patients died during the follow-up (mean 4.0 years, 1186 patient years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six (2%) patients had verified CAD recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for the association of CAD with male sex, and possible association with smoking and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of the dissected artery, ICAD, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> appear to be associated with poorer outcome </plain></SENT>
