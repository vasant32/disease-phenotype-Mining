<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: High in-stent restenosis (ISR) rates have been reported after treatment of intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Balloon-mounted drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation has led to an ISR reduction in coronary vessels and may provide a solution to overcome this obstacle in the intracranial circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present our initial experience with the everolimus-eluting stent (EES; Abbott Vascular, Abbott Park, Illinois, USA), a second-generation balloon-mounted DES, for ICAS treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of prospectively collected endovascular data at our institution resulted in the identification of six patients with ICAS treated with EES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data collected included patient demographics, presentation, comorbidities and lesion, intervention and follow-up details </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: These six patients had &gt;70% angiographic ICAS and history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, despite aspirin therapy and medical management of comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lesions were located in the V4-vertebral artery segment (n=2), M1 middle cerebral artery segment (n=1), proximal basilar artery (n=1), supraclinoid internal carotid artery (n=1) and petrous internal carotid artery (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Average stenosis severity was 82.8±6.6% (median, 80%); average lesion length was 10.2±2.2 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stent placement was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Average postintervention stenosis was 5.5±4.4% (median, 7.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient had postintervention reperfusion <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> that required urgent decompressive craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the five patients with angiographic follow-up (5-6 months) had ISR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The six patients had 4-10 months of clinical follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Only the patient with reperfusion <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> had decreased functional status after treatment (modified Rankin scale score=4) and is making a slow recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study confirms feasibility of use of a second-generation DES for ICAS and provides short-term follow-up results </plain></SENT>
