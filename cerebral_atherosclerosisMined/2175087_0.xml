<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these, 93% of the patients also had lesions of the other main arteries of the head </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been established that in concomitant lesions of the main arteries of the brain, the role of the ophthalmic artery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>) rises as to the compensation for the blood flow in the damaged hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Involvement of the ophthalmic anastomosis into blood supply of the damaged hemisphere was found to inversely correlated to EICMA function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Active functioning of EICMA brings about a decrease of the retrograde blood flow in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> and in some cases, alteration in the direction of the blood flow in that artery, namely from retrograde to antegrade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless additional blood flow via EICMA promotes elevation of the level of the cerebral blood flow in the regions of the middle cerebral artery basin, supplied via the microarterial anastomosis </plain></SENT>
