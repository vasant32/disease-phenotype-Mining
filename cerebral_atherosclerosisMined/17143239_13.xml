<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report the 1-month and intermediate-term results of treatment of symptomatic intracranial stenosis using drug-eluting stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with intracranial stenosis who are at high risk because of either high-grade stenosis or medication failure may have an annual risk of recurrent ischemic events in excess of 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Drug-eluting stents may reduce the rate of ischemic events in patients with a low restenosis rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We determined rates of technical success (defined as reduction of target lesion to stenosis &lt;30%) and 1-month major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis (&gt; or =70% and/or medication failure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients' clinical and follow-up information during a mean period of 14.3 +/- 7 months were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to determine the rate of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free survival during 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 18 patients (mean age, 58 +/- 16 yr; 12 were men) treated with either a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi>-eluting stent (n = 14) or a paclitaxel-eluting stent (n = 4) for stenosis located in the: intracranial internal carotid artery (n = 6), proximal middle cerebral artery (n = 4), intracranial vertebral artery (n = 4), vertebrobasilar junction (n = 2), or basilar artery (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was one major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> observed in the 1-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the 6-month follow-up examination, no major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free survival was 86% (+/-standard error of 9%) at 12 months after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One symptomatic angiographic restenosis was observed during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A low rate of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was observed after treatment of symptomatic intracranial stenosis using drug-eluting stents in high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
