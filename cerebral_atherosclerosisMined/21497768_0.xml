<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Gender is known to be one of the factors linked to differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little information is available regarding gender differences in the risk factors for intracranial cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (ICAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the risk factors for ICAS separately by gender in an asymptomatic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We collected data from a consecutive series of 935 subjects who had no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and who had undergone transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For each subject, their medical history was documented and tests for biochemical markers were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analyses were separately conducted to assess the risk factors associated with ICAS by gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The risk factors for asymptomatic ICAS were determined for every 10-year increase in age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23-2.46), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) (OR = 3.45, 95% CI = 1.49-7.95), smoking (OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.01-4.32), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> (OR = 3.31, 95% CI = 1.15-9.50) for male subjects; risk factors female subjects included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.40-3.15) and DM (OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.11-5.44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An additional stratified analysis indicated that there was no significant risk factor for male subjects aged &lt;50 years, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR = 2.90, 95% CI = 1.57-5.37) was the significant risk factor for female subjects aged &lt;50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For male subjects aged ≥50 years, DM (OR = 6.00, 95% CI = 1.87-19.20), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> (OR = 4.72, 95% CI = 1.05-21.19), and every 10-year increase in age (OR = 4.33, 95% CI = 2.02-9.28) were significant risk factors for asymptomatic ICAS, whereas DM (OR = 2.93, 95% CI = 1.14-7.48) was significant for female subjects aged ≥50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the risk factors for asymptomatic ICAS differ between sexes, indicating a possible role of sex hormones in the development of ICAS </plain></SENT>
