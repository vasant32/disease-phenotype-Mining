<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To search for a potential role of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor and presumably neurotoxic 21-amino acid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, for dysfunction of brain signal processing and cerebrovascular morbidity in nondemented patients with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional study with longitudinal follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University-affiliated teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: A total of 106 nondemented patients with significant stenosis of either the internal carotid (cAD, cases; n = 63, mean age +/- SD, 62 +/- 7 years) or peripheral arteries (pAD, disease controls; n = 43, 60 +/- 11 years) were investigated before carotid endarterectomy and bypass surgery, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of about 19 months, cerebrovascular morbidity of the cAD and pAD patients was evaluated by phone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Brain signal processing functions by event-related visual P300 potentials; cerebrovascular events by a structured telephone interview; the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> by venous ET-1 concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Venous ET-1 levels were elevated in both cAD and pAD patient groups, but to the same degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these patients, ET-1 concentration was correlated slightly with diastolic blood pressure (r = .334, P = .0326, stepwise regression) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only in cAD patients with ET-1 levels above the 75th percentile were P300 latencies markedly prolonged compared with their lower ET-1 level counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the P300 latencies of the cAD patients, but not of the pAD patients, correlated positively with venous ET-1 concentration and inversely with pack years of smoking (r = .728, P = .0002; stepwise regression) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast to base-line P300 abnormalities and classical risk factors (e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>), high ET-1 levels predicted an increased cerebrovascular morbidity of cAD, but not of pAD, patients (P = .0044; Mantel Cox test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In nondemented patients with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>, endothelin-1 is associated with P300 abnormalities reflecting subclinical dysfunction of brain signal processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the long-term, high venous ET-1 levels also appear to predict a higher cerebrovascular morbidity of cAD patients even after carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
