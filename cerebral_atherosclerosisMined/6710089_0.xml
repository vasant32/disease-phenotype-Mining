<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied and compared 120 cases with an infarction in the superficial area of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) or the posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the patients with an infarction of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> area, 8% had a capsular involvement and 3% a delayed contralateral sylvian infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the patients with an infarction of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> area, 35% had a thalamo-mesencephalic involvement and 23% a delayed contralateral occipital infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, multifocal infarction was significantly more frequent in the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> area than in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No particular vascular risk factor could explain this difference, which may be related to general constitutional factors, such as the type of collateral supply or the vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> area only, we found a significant association between the severity of risk factors and occurrence of multifocal infarction </plain></SENT>
