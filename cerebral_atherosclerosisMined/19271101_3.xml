<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statins</z:chebi> have been demonstrated to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and to slow or halt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to observe the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> on the progression of IAS, explore the factors associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> regression and the recurrent rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A hospital-base observation study enrolled 40 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) or/and basilar artery (BA) stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> and were given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> 40 mg per day for at least six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IAS was assessed by magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) at the time of enrollment and then at least six months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was the progression of IAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were also given antiplatelet agents for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the end of the study, 23 (58 %), 15 (38 %) and 2 (4 %) patients had regressed, stationary and progressed IAS, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Females were likely to have regressed IAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 18 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among the 54 stenotic vessels, 29 (54 %) vessels were assessed as improvement in stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Compared with other studies, more regressed, stationary IAS and less progressed IAS were found in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Female gender was likely to have regressed IAS after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further clinical outcome trials are required to assess the effects of such therapy on morbidity and mortality in this particular group of patients </plain></SENT>
