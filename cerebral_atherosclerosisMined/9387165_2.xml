<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgical results have remained unsatisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We review 22 cases of large or giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and/or atherosclerotic thickening of the aneurysmal neck that have received direct surgical management in our department during the period from 1984 to 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As initial symptoms, ten patients presented with mass effect, five with ischemic attack, and three with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were supratentorial and six were in the posterior fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Direct neck clipping was attempted in sixteen cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two giant basilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> among them were clipped under deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Simple trapping of the parent artery was performed in three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and trapping with bypass graft was also carried out in three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten patients made an excellent clinical recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients suffered mild to severe disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> resulted from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e>, not directly related with surgical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Appropriate preoperative assessment and intraoperative management of the associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and atherosclerotic change of the aneurysmal neck are essential for obtaining acceptable surgical results of large or giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
