<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebral revascularization in the deep surgical field is technically challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Especially, side-to-side anastomosis like A3-A3 could be technically more difficult compared with end-to-side anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To improve surgeon's dexterity and maneuverability in the deep surgical field, the authors developed an easily accessible and well-simulating training system using prosthetic tubes and a box </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two prosthetic tubes (silicon tube, 1.2 mm in diameter) are mounted in parallel on the bottom of 6.5-cm-deep emptied 'tissue paper box.' The orifice of the box is restricted to 2 x 2 cm to simulate a deep and narrow surgical corridor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using bayonet-shaped micro needle holder and forceps, the side-to-side anastomosis of the tubes is performed with 10-0 nylon under operative microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prosthetic tubes well simulated real A3-A3 anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From the standpoint of technical difficulty, this training system needed slightly higher level of dexterity compared with real A3-A3 anastomosis because of narrower and deeper surgical corridor, and the wall of prosthetic tube was slightly thicker and more inflexible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After this training, the surgical technique in real A3-A3 anastomosis was improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This training system worked well to ease the transition from anastomosis in shallow surgical field to deep and narrow surgical field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prosthetic tube we used approximates real A3 relatively well, and the ease in setting up this system enabled repeated practice, which resulted in steep learning curve of the technique </plain></SENT>
