<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the associations between PON polymorphisms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the associations between PON polymorphisms and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 350 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and 242 control subjects in Korean population were genotyped for the PON1M55 L, PON1Q192R, PON2A148 G and PON2S311C polymorphisms using melting point analysis with LightCycler real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences in genotype and allele distribution of the PON polymorphisms between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concentration of total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> was significantly different in the PON1M55 L polymorphism (P = 0.047), and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (Apo)B concentration was significantly different in the PON1Q192R polymorphism (P = 0.02) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol and ApoB were significantly different between the PON2A148 G (P = 0.011, P = 0.000, respectively) and PON2S311C polymorphisms (P = 0.046, P = 0.003, respectively) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study did not provide association between PON gene polymorphisms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, it confirmed that the PON1L55 L allele is associated with plasma concentration of total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> and that the PON2G148 G and PON2S311S allele is associated with plasma concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and ApoB </plain></SENT>
