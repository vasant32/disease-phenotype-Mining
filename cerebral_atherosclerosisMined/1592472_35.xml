<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Rotterdam Elderly Study is a recently started single-center prospective follow-up study of a cohort of 11,854 elderly people aged 55 years or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 1990, 954 participants of the Rotterdam Elderly Study underwent ultrasonic duplex examination of the right internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A reduction of the lumen diameter of 16-49% was found in 29 people (3.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severe stenosis (50% or more) was observed in 13 people (1.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With differences in age, sex, and body mass index taken into account, subjects with moderate-to-severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> had, compared with participants without stenosis, lower mean <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> levels (mean difference, 0.10 mmol/l; 95% confidence interval, 0, 0.20) and higher mean fibrinogen levels (difference, 0.24 g/l; 0.04, 0.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among them were more people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (mean difference, 16%) and more current smokers (mean difference, 13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Factor VIIc and factor VIIIc activity was higher in subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e>, without, however, reaching statistical significance (mean difference, 0.06 IU/ml [-0.01, 0.12] and 0.21 IU/ml [-0.05, 0.47], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, smoking, and reduced serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> levels, combined with unfavorable increases in hemostatic factors, may be related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> in the elderly </plain></SENT>
