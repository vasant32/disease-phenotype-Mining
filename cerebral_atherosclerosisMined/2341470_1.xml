<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report the late results of 44 surgically and 40 non-surgically treated patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> documented by angiography in 1974-1976 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The groups were similar with respect to sex-distribution, age, length of follow-up time (median 123.0 and 130.0 months in the surgical and non-surgical groups, respectively) and the occurrence of risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was more frequent (p less than 0.05) in the surgical group, as was medical treatment, mostly <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (p less than 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The angiographic findings were also more severe in this group (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period the occurrence of cerebrovascular complications (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) was more frequent in the nonoperated than in the operated group; however, survival of the patients was similar, as the cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were an equalizing factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The quality of life in patients alive examined for clinical and neurologic status and by neuropsychological tests and interview was similar, except that the operated patients were more satisfied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the carotid artery assessed by Duplex scanning was more frequent in the nonoperated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differences in medical treatment did not explain the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus it is concluded that the late results were better in the operated patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> than in the nonoperated ones </plain></SENT>
