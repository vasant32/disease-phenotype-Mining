<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (ICAS) is one of the major risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, particularly in Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the prevalence and risk factors of ICAS in asymptomatic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 835 asymptomatic Korean adults who voluntarily visited a tertiary referral hospital for a health screening examination that included brain magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects had no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>; those who had potential cardiac sources of emboli were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ICAS and extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were defined as a reduction in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter of at least 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vascular risk factors were screened through questionnaires, interviews, and examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ICAS was found in 25 subjects (3.0%) and extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was found in 4 patients (0.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient had combined lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ICAS was distributed in 31 arteries in 25 subjects: anterior cerebral arteries (5 subjects, 16%), middle cerebral arteries (16 subjects, 52%), posterior cerebral arteries (8 subjects, 26%), and distal internal carotid arteries (2 subjects, 7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ratio of ICAS of the anterior circulation (23 of 31 arteries with ICAS, 74%) to that of the posterior circulation (8 of 31 arteries with ICAS, 26%) was 3:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ratio of ICAS (23 of 27 arteries with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the anterior circulation, 85%) to extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (4 of 27 arteries with therosclerosis in the anterior circulation, 15%) was 6:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An older age [odds ratio (OR)=1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.00-1.10] and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR=2.41, 95% CI=1.01-5.72) were independent risk factors for ICAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ICAS is more prevalent than extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> among neurologically asymptomatic Korean adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Subjects with ICAS are significantly older and have an increased frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> compared to those subjects without atherosclerotic stenosis </plain></SENT>
