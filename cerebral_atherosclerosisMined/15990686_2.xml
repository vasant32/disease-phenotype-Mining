<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The C282Y and H63D mutations in the <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> (HFE) gene are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003452'>increased serum iron</z:hpo> levels and net iron accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene are risk factors for ACI in a Slovene population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: The C282Y and H63D HFE gene mutations were tested in 96 Caucasian patients who had suffered an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, later confirmed as ACI, and 115 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotypes were determined by electrophoresis of the DNA digestion products from RsaI (C282Y) and MboI (H63D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We failed to demonstrate that the C282Y and H63D mutations were risk factors for ACI in Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of C282Y and H63D genotypes (dominant model) in ACI-cases (C282Y: 7.3%, n=7; H63D: 28.1%, n=27) did not differ significantly (P=0.9 and P=0.7 respectively) from that of the controls (C282Y: 7.0%, n=8; H63D: 26.1%, n=30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis revealed that arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and cigarette smoking are independent risk factors for ACI, whereas the C282Y and H63D HFE gene mutations are not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We provided evidence that the C282Y and H63D HFE gene mutations were not risk factors for ACI in this Slovene population </plain></SENT>
