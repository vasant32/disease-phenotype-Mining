<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experimental evidence suggests that genetic determinants do contribute a large part to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The identification of phosphodiesterase 4D gene as a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> caused a great deal of interest in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> genetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many of the studies of PDE4D gene have focused on the original Icelandic findings but the association between specific SNPs and haplotypes has been inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of three SNPs 32 (rs 456009), 83 (rs 966221) and 87 (rs 2910829), originally described by deCODE group; with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a South Indian population from Andhra Pradesh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and fifty <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients and two hundred and fifty controls were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were sub typed according to TOAST classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SNP 83 showed significant association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the population under study while SNPs 87 and 32 were monomorphic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further SNP 83 was found to be significantly associated with two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes, intracranial large artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (the most frequent subtype in the population) and small <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association with other subtypes was found to be insignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further, SNP 83 was found to be associated significantly with some conventional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors like <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and smoking </plain></SENT>
