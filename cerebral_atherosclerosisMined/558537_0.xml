<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 65 year old male had left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> with sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> since 8 years ago, which gradually aggravated for these 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On Sept </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>27, 1973, he was admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery, Kitano Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was left spastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> with hemisensory disturbance and he could not walk without help for the maked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left carotid angiogram revealed the complete occlusion of the internal carotid artery and marked stenosis of the external carotid artery at the common carotid bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>External carotid endarterectomy was performed on Nov </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>19, 1973, which was followed by STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis 2 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo> of extremities and left hemisparesis were gradually improved and he was able to walk without help </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Case 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On Apr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>14, 1974, a 63 year old female developed complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and speech disturbance after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> of 5 days duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On Aug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>9, he was admitted and had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142234" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional incontinence</z:e>, right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017494" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Gerstmann's syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002427'>motor aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Left carotid angiogram revealed a saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the middle cerebral artery and the occlusion of the distal middle cerebral arterys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that the occlusion was caused by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> from the middle <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo>, and the combined surgery with STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis and operation for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was planned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>On Aug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>30, 1974, under left frontotemporal craniotomy, aneurysmal neck clipping and aneurysmectomy were performed and thereafter, STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> double anastomosis was done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>One week after operation, the gradual improvement of pre-operative symptomes was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Recently, STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anatomosis is well known to be one of the effective operative methods for the occlusive methods for the occlusive cerebrovascular diseases and in addition, we found that the combination of STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis with other operations was effective for unusual cases presenting in this report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, except for the occlusive cerebrovascular diseases, we usually plan STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis for the cases of 1) carotid ligation or trapping for carotid-cavernous sinus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> and some internal carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 2) some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527390" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intracranial tumors</z:e> with the danger involving the main cerebral arteries by operation to protect the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241832" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular insufficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
