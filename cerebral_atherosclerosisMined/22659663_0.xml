<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We selected 50 patients with early cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> as the disease group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the same time we selected another 50 patients as a control group with no significant symptoms in the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By 2 MHz pulse Doppler probe through double-temporal windows and pillow windows Basilar artery (BA), the bilateral middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the TCD spectrum, we selected the spectrum of a single-family cardiac cycle, identified the starting point (ts), pulse-incisure point (ti), end point (te), and the peak velocity (tp), measured the time of the spectrum starting point to the peak velocity (Tp) and calculated the time required for the peak velocity in the share of ventricular systolic (Tp/Ti), the time required for the peak velocity in the share of the whole cardiac cycle (Tp/T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tp, Tp/Ti and Tp/T were respectively named as time to peak velocity (<z:mp ids='MP_0010601'>TPV</z:mp>), peak-time index-1 (PTI-1) and peak-time index-2 (PTI-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> data were analyzed by SPSS13.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in blood vessel velocity, PI, RI and S/D of BA and RMCA (P&gt;0.05) between the control group and the disease group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with the control group, <z:mp ids='MP_0010601'>TPV</z:mp> of the BA, LMCA and RMCA significantly extended, PTI-1 and PTI-2 of BA, LMCA and RMCA increased significantly in the disease group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the disease group, there was no significant correlation between peak time index and PI, S/D (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mp ids='MP_0010601'>TPV</z:mp>, PTI-1 and PTI-2 are sensitive indicators of early stage cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
