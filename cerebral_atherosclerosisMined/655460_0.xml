<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease's rate of progress has been studied anatomically, clinically, radiologically, and plethysmographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> is usually associated with other diseases such as <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, high blood cholesterol, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Heart disease</z:e> in particular is often the cause of the patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, rather than the peripheral arteriosclerotic disease itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The usually slow development and course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> indicate that its treatment is largely a medical problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It seems important to control the various risk factors and to utilize surgical therapy to attack specific lesions which threaten the tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A thorough cardiovascular profile of the patient should be compiled and should include a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> phenotyping </plain></SENT>
