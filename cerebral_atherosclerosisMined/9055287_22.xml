<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the occurrence of periventricular lesions (PVLs) and deep white matter lesions (DWMLs) in elderly patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>) and in an age-matched control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PVLs and DWMLs were evaluated using T2-weighted magnetic resonance scans of 37 patients with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> and 35 participants from an age-matched control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> included in this study improved after shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of 16 healthy elderly persons and 19 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To allow quantitative assessment and comparison, scores for PVLs and DWMLs were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, possible correlations between white matter lesion scores, ventricular width, and age were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significantly higher incidence of PVLs and DWMLs in patients with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean total PVL was 12.1 (range, 2-24) in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> group and 3.9 (range, 0-10) in the control group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean total DWML score was 12.9 (range, 3-24) in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> group and 4.5 (range, 0-16) in the control group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were significant correlations between the severity of PVL and DWML scores in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only a weak positive correlation between the severity of DWMLs and age was found in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> group, whereas this correlation was significant in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a significant negative correlation between the width of the anterior horns and the severity of both PVLs and DWMLs in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e>; however, positive correlations were found in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Elderly patients with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> have more frequent and more severe PVLs and DWMLs than people in age-matched control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest a frequent co-occurrence of idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> and vascular subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>; however, they do not support a direct causal relationship </plain></SENT>
