<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Baseline cerebral angiograms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiograms were used to determine AIS (50% to 99%) coexistent to symptomatic intracranial stenosis for patients enrolled in the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi>-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Coexisting AIS were detected in 18.9% (n=14/74) of patients undergoing 4-vessel cerebral angiography and 27.3% (n=65/238) of patients undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up period of 1.8 years, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> were attributable to an AIS on cerebral angiography and 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> (5.9%, 95% CI: 2.1% to 12.3%) occurred in the AIS territory on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiogram (risk at 1 year=3.5%, 95% CI: 0.8% to 9.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Whereas the prevalence of coexisting AIS (50% to 99%) in patients with symptomatic stenosis is high, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from these asymptomatic stenoses is low </plain></SENT>
