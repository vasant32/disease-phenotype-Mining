<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of ubiquitin conjugates and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) was assessed and found significantly higher in plaques than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue and higher in unstable plaques than in stable plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ubiquitin conjugates and NF-κB were positively correlated with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that the ubiquitin proteasome system and NF-κB possibly play a role in the development of atherosclerotic plaques in intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
