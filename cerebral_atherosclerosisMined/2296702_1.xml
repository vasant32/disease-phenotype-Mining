<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>When an obstruction of a cerebral vessel is hemodynamically relevant and insufficiently collateralized--and when the mechanisms of compensation are exhausted--it can lead to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The second and more common way a vascular obstructive lesion can become symptomatic is the shedding of emboli to the periphery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The extra-/intracranial arterial bypass (EIAB), most often constructed as an anastomosis between the superficial temporal artery (STA) and a cortical branch of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), increases cerebral blood flow when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the mechanisms of compensation are exhausted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When not, it augments the cerebral perfusion reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is due to embolism, the therapy of choice is elimination of the embolic source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When using the EIAB in hemodynamically caused <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, there are two indications: a therapeutic and a prophylactic one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differentiation between functional and structural damage of neurons is difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because reversible longlasting functional loss is rare, we reject it as a therapeutic indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prophylactic EIAB has to overcome the hemodynamic consequences of an intentional or spontaneous obstruction of extra- or intracranial cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Currently, neither the asymmetry of cerebral perfusion nor a decrease of the the cerebral perfusion reserve are established as risk factors for future ischemic cerebral events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> is to be occluded, a prophylactic EIAB is indicated: When the intention is to occlude the ICA with its extensive collateral system, the necessity for a bypass has to be evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most often, spontaneous occlusion of cerebral vessels is of atherosclerotic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because no reliable method exists to differentiate between embolic (arterio-arterial) and hemodynamic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>; and since the spontaneous course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is not predictable, the prophylactic indications for EIAB are unresolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, many uncontrolled studies have shown a good prophylactic effect after the EIAB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The randomized international EC/IC Bypass Study, which is not accepted without reservation, denies any advantage of the EIAB in treating atherosclerotic vessel lesions when compared to medication with aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our experience leads us to believe that a prophylactic effect of the EIAB, even with atherosclerotic vessel obstruction, cannot be denied point blank </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, our experience also confirms that the EIAB should not be the standard treatment for atherosclerotic vessel obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Considering the broad differences in the individual architecture of the cerebral vascular system and its varied amounts of acquired vascular lesions and through the spontaneous development of collaterals, the indications for EIAB, which in some circumstances is very effective, must be assessed for each individual patient </plain></SENT>
