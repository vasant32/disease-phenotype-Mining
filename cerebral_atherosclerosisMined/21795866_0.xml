<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the periprocedural complication rates and mid-term restenosis rates in patients treated with balloon-expandable stents (BESs) compared with self-expanding stents (SESs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of consecutive patients treated with intracranial stents at 5 institutions was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Predictors of 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as well as mid-term restenosis rates were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 670 lesions were treated in 637 patients with a mean age of 57 Â± 13 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 454 lesions (68%) were treated with BESs and 216 lesions (32%) with SESs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall 30-day periprocedural complication rate was 6.1%, without any difference noted between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients treated within 24 hours of the index event were significantly more likely to have experienced a periprocedural complication (odds ratio [OR], 4.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7-6.7; P &lt; .007), whereas focal lesions were less likely to have a complication (OR, 0.31; 95% CI: 0.13-0.72; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Midterm restenosis was less likely in patients with a lower percentage of posttreatment stenosis (OR, 0.97; 95% CI: 0.95-0.99; P &lt; .006), which was more common in <z:chebi fb="114" ids="39041,39043">BES</z:chebi>-treated patients and focal concentric lesions (OR, 0.33; 95% CI: 0.23-0.55; P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BESs have periprocedural complication rates similar to those of SESs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Less posttreatment stenosis was associated with lower rates of mid-term restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future randomized trials comparing BESs and SESs may help to identify the stent type that is safest and most durable </plain></SENT>
