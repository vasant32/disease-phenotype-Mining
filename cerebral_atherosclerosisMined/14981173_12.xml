<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors prospectively studied 22 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infratentorial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They used a blinded comparison of DWI features (number, distribution, and volume of lesions) with clinical characteristics, namely, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiology (Trial of ORG 10172 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Treatment [TOAST] classification), severity (NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale [NIHSS]), length of stay (LOS), and functional 3-month outcome using modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index, and a dichotomized outcome status (living at home vs institutionalization or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> infratentorial DWI lesions were detected in 95% (21/22) of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number (p = 0.01) and the distribution (p &lt; 0.001) of DWI lesions were correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (n = 5) had more DWI lesions (8.0 +/- 6.0) than those with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiologies (n = 17; 1.3 +/- 0.9; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their lesion distribution differed from that of patients with noncardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinically silent, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> DWI lesions in the anterior circulation in addition to their infratentorial lesions were visualized in 3 of 5 patients with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and in none of 17 patients without sources of cardioembolism (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pure infratentorial lesions were present in 15 of 17 patients with noncardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and in none of 5 cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DWI lesion volume was not correlated with NIHSS score, LOS, outcome scores, or outcome status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In infratentorial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, multiple DWI lesions and a distribution of subsidiary, clinically silent DWI lesions in the anterior circulation suggest a cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, DWI lesion volume did not correlate with the NIHSS score and was no predictor of outcome </plain></SENT>
