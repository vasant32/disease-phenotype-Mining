<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An autopsy study of cerebral vessels in 310 Ghanaian adults showed an incidence of macro(berry)<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of 16.6% among 181 hypertensives and 8.5% among 129 normotensives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> increased the formation and development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (Grade 3) was not a common association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and there was no increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation in subjects dying from cerebral haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This may be a reflection of the observed low incidence of severe cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in Ghanaians compared to whites and an indication of differences between ethnic groups in the relative importance of the factors that contribute to the formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mortality from ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> could not be determined from this study, perhaps because the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> seen were small in size (less than 10 mm diameter) and less likely to rupture and bleed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were an uncommon finding compared to figures quoted in other studies, but in agreement with them the sites of predilection were in the anterior parts of the Circle of Willis; notably the anterior cerebral and anterior communicating arteries </plain></SENT>
