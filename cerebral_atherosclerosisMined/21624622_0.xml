<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: There has been limited attention to pathological features of basilar artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been assumed that pathology of basilar artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> mimics that of other vascular beds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To define the nature of the basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp>, we analyzed postmortem intracranial artery samples from eight subjects with history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>Atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> were present in 7/8 arteries examined, with a mean estimated stenosis of 34% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lumen <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> with a disrupted fibrous cap was seen in 1 lesion; the remaining 6 lesions revealed a thick fibrous cap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neovascularity and calcification were seen in 1 lesion and mild to moderate <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was seen in 3 lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Necrotic core was present in 4/7 lesions, and was associated with plaque rupture in the only disrupted lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> were relatively benign in this series of patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While confirmation is needed with larger sample size, the relative paucity of neovascularity suggests a possibly distinctive histopathological profile </plain></SENT>
