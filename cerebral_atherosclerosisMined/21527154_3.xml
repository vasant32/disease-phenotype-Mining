<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We aimed to define the relationship between cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> may play a crucial role in the advent of post-CABG <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, only extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> has been extensively studied, and the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> on the mechanisms underlying post-CABG <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pre-operative magnetic resonance angiography was performed on 1,367 consecutive CABG patients to assess intracranial and extracranial cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disease severity was evaluated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> score, as determined by the number of steno-occlusions of cerebral arteries and the degree thereof </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Post-CABG <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (within 14 days) were classified as atherosclerotic (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> attributable to pre-defined <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>) or other (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> caused by other mechanisms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations between post-CABG <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and each type of atherosclerotic disease (extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e>, intracranial, extracranial, or extracranial and/or intracranial cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>), differentiated according to the involved arteries, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> occurred in 33 patients, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> score was independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> development (odds ratio: 1.35; 95% confidence interval: 1.16 to 1.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was defined in 15 (45%), and constituted &gt;40% of both immediate (within 24 h) and delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intracranial, extracranial, and extracranial and/or intracranial cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was closely related to the occurrence of post-CABG <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, being both an independent risk factor for and the cause of a significant proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pre-operative evaluation of intracranial and extracranial cerebral arteries, apart from the extracranial carotid artery, may be useful to predict the likelihood of post-CABG <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
