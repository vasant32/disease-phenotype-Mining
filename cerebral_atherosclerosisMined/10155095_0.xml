<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Randomized studies have proven the efficacy and safety of stent placement to treat de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242231" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary stenosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the poor radio-opacity and the use of an additional high-pressure balloon to fully expand the stent are the major limitations of the currently clinically-approved stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the safety, efficacy, angiographic and histologic effect of a new <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> balloon expandable stent mounted on a high-pressure balloon in Yucatan miniature swine fed high cholesterol diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen Angiostents (NuMED, Inc., Hopkinton, NY and Angiodynamics, Glens <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>Falls</z:hpo>, NY) (coronary stent was 3, 3.5, or 4 mm in diameter and 12 mm long; renal and carotid stents were 5 mm in diameter and 13 mm long) mounted on a high-pressure balloon were placed percutaneously in blood vessels of 10 pigs [5 in circumflex (CX), 2 in left anterior descending (LAD), 5 in renal and 3 in carotid arteries] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The stent was 10-20% larger than the native vessel diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals received 5000 I.U. of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> during the procedure and were maintained on 325 mg aspirin daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up angiography and histology in the animals was performed at 2, 4, 12, 20, 26 and 52 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The stents were easily visualized with fluoroscopy and placed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals without episodes of balloon rupture or embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up angiography in the animals revealed patency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> renal and carotid stents, however, 2/7 coronary stents in the animals revealed angiographic lumen narrowing (&gt; 20%) at 20 and 52 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histologic examination revealed neointimal formation at the stent site with an average neointimal thickness ranging from 325-650 microns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This stent was safe in this animal model, easily deployed, had excellent radio-opacity and with good short-term patency without anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials and experience is underway </plain></SENT>
