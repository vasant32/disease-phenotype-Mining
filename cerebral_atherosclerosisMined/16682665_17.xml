<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors evaluated the prevalence and prognosis of the MetS among individuals with symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients enrolled in the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi>-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease trial were evaluated in this post-hoc analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics and outcome were compared in patients with the MetS vs patients without the MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 476 patients, the prevalence of the MetS was 43% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MetS patients were more likely to be younger, female, and white </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up period of 1.8 years, time to the first of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was shorter among patients with the MetS with a hazard ratio (syndrome/no syndrome) of 1.6 (95% CI = 1.1 to 2.4, p = 0.0097) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> alone was also shorter among patients with the MetS with a hazard ratio (syndrome/no syndrome) of 1.7 (95% CI = 1.1 to 2.6, p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When controlling for individual factors of the definition, MetS was not significant (combined outcome: p = 0.14; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>: p = 0.074) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> is present in about half of individuals with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease and is associated with a substantially higher risk of major vascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> may not provide additional ability to predict outcomes beyond the individual factors for patients with intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
