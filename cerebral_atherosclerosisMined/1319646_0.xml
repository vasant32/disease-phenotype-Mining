<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Use was made of an approach with the use of autonomic and psychological techniques as well as of a polygraphic recording of the electrophysiological parameters of nocturnal sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been established that both groups patients manifest <z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi> dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, its qualitative characteristics were found to differ noticeably in IMBBSI and AE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients with DE demonstrate more remarkable inhibition of the synchronous mechanisms that regulate both phases of nocturnal sleep and reciprocal enhancement of the activity of the systems of the ascending nonspecific brain activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The autonomic and psychological data agree with the electrophysiological data obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The conclusion is drawn that in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241832" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular insufficiency</z:e>, the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi> systems are first of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> involved in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is of importance for both the diagnosis and further studies into the pathogenesis of different forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241832" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular insufficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
