<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lead and copper were capable of deposition in some tissues in vitro in the presence of iron and/or calcium but not when these minerals were removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon may be of importance in certain pathological conditions, e.g. <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp>, where on preexisting tissue-iron-complexes there is a secondary deposition of copper </plain></SENT>
