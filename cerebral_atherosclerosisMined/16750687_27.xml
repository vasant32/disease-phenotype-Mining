<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this work was to determine the predictive value of oxidized <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> (OxPLs) present on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B-100 particles (apoB) in carotid and femoral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The OxPLs are pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic and may be detected using the antibody E06 (OxPL/apoB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Bruneck study is a prospective population-based survey of 40- to 79-year-old men and women initiated in 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of OxPL/apoB and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a) [Lp(a)] were measured in 765 of 826 (92.6%) and 671 of 684 (98.1%) subjects alive in 1995 and 2000, respectively, and correlated with ultrasound measures of carotid and femoral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The distribution of the OxPL/apoB levels was skewed to lower levels and nearly identical to Lp(a) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The OxPL/apoB and Lp(a) levels were highly correlated (r = 0.87, p &lt; 0.001), and displayed long-term stability and lacked correlations with most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and lifestyle variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (a) kringle IV-2 repeats was inversely related to Lp(a) mass (r = -0.48, p &lt; 0.001) and OxPL/apoB levels (r = -0.46, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, OxPL/apoB levels were strongly and significantly associated with the presence, extent, and development (1995 to 2000) of carotid and femoral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and predicted the presence of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both OxPL/apoB and Lp(a) levels showed similar associations with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> severity and progression, suggesting a common biological influence on atherogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that pro-inflammatory oxidized <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, present primarily on Lp(a), are significant predictors of the presence and extent of carotid and femoral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, development of new lesions, and increased risk of cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The OxPL biomarkers may provide valuable insights into diagnosing and monitoring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
