<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A series of 9 patients over 70 years of age with saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, operated on by a direct surgery is reviewed in order to discuss the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery in the older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median age of the patients was 74 years, and median interval from the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> to surgery was 18 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality was 11% and morbidity was 33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery in the older patients depends on the surgical technique for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> neck must be abandoned when a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> exists around it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequent to exposure of the whole <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, a complete reinforcement of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> wall should be undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Especially gentle manipulation of the brain is necessary since small arteries are easily pulled out from the sclerotic artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cerebral veins must be preserved as well as possible to avoid the venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath>, which easily causes an intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> following brain retraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The frequency of pre and postoperative complications is high, but through vigorous care, they are kept under control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is best not to judge the surgical indication simply by the chronological age, but rather to consider the physical age including the laboratory findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Therefore, other than cases of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>, the same principles for surgical indication in younger patients should be used for older patients </plain></SENT>
