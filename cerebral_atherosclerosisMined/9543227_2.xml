<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cultured vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells actively produce adrenomedullin, a novel <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> discovered in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This present study was designed to determine whether the plasma level of adrenomedullin is a useful indicator for estimating the degree of endothelial injury in patients with atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used a radioimmunoassay to measure plasma adrenomedullin concentrations in 51 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cerebrovascular disease (34 infarctions and 17 haemorrhages) and in 10 subjects without symptomatic cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also measured the plasma concentrations of thrombomodulin and endothelin as markers of endothelial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into three groups (A, B, and C) on the basis of the number of risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL-cholesterol</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group A (68.7+/-2.7 years) consisted of patients with 0 or 1 risk factors; B (68.3+/-4.2 years) those with 2 risk factors; and C (69.2+/-3.6 years) those with 3 or more risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The plasma concentration of adrenomedullin in these patients showed a significant positive correlation with age (r=0.33, p&lt;0.05), as well as with the plasma concentrations of thrombomodulin (r=0.54, p&lt;0.001) and endothelin (r=0.53, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the plasma concentrations of adrenomedullin and thrombomodulin (p&lt;0.005 and p&lt;0.02, respectively) tended to be higher in Group B and to be significantly higher in Group C as compared to Group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma adrenomedullin concentrations did not, however, significantly differ between the infarction and haemorrhage patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the plasma adrenomedullin concentrations reflect the degree of endothelial injury in patients with atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
