<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied whether the PCSK9 gene is linked to the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (IS) and with the development of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS/RESULTS: The pivotal E670G polymorphism, tagging an important haplotype of the PCSK9 gene, was genotyped in two independent studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Belgium <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Study included 237 middle aged (45-60) Belgian patients, with small-vessel occlusion (SVO) and large-vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (LVA), and 326 gender and ethnicity matched controls (&gt;60 yrs) without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis the minor allele (G) carriers appeared as a significant predictor of LVA (OR = 3.52, 95% CI 1.25-9.85; p = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a Finnish crossectional population based consecutive autopsy series of 604 males and females (mean age 62.5 years), G-allele carriers tended to have more severe allele copy number-dependent (p = 0.095) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the circle of Willis and in its branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings in this unique combination of clinical and autopsy data, provide evidence that PCSK9 gene associates with the risk of LVA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype, and suggest that the risk is mediated by the severity of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
