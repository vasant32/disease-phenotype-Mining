<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects comprised 109 cases of pontine infarction with high signal on T2-weighted image and low signal on T1-weighted image (PI group), 145 of pontine high signal with high signal on T2-weighted image but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> signal on T1-weighted image (PH group) and 276 of age-matched control without abnormality either on T1 or T2-weighted images (AC group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjective complaints such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>-dizziness were more frequent in the PH group than in the PI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both PI and PH groups, periventricular hyperintensity as well as subcortical high signals in the supratentorium were more severe than in the AC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These degrees were higher in the PI group than in the PH group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, PH as well as PI may result from diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> and PH is considered to be an early finding of pontine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
