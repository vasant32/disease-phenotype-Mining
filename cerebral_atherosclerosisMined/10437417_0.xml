<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In about 80% of the cases of vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain diseases</z:e>, it is ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of main cerebral arteries is most frequently responsible for the occurrence and development of IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In recent years it was reported for the first time of the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and/or its complications and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Assuming that there exists the significant association between the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and clinical parameters of IBD, the aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and patterns of the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and clinical IBD parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study was performed in 180 patients with IBD of atherothrombotic origin and 60 patients with the diseases of non-vascular origin, as the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients quantitative determination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> was performed, and in the patients with IBD was determined the degree of IBD and afterwards the degree of functional and neurologic impairment prior to and at the end of treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase using the standardized scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of the study revealed the existence of significant frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> in the patients with IBD, as well as the significant association between the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and severity of IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> in patients with IBD was probably associated with the atherogenic processes and physiopathologic processes of IBD, respectively, which could have predictive value for the outcome of the disease in the early stage </plain></SENT>
