<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation is a central event in the development of arteriosclerotic plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regulation of this proliferative process is controlled in part by the action of specific <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> growth factors that may influence early cell-cycle regulatory gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such "early" response genes include the protooncogene c-myc, which has been implicated in the induction of cell proliferation and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the distribution of the c-myc protooncogene product in healthy and atherosclerotic human carotid arteries to determine its cellular and tissue localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Samples of six carotid artery plaques from six patients were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen at the time of carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three nondiseased human carotid arteries obtained at organ harvest from brain-dead organ donors were similarly prepared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Frozen sections were labeled with a polyclonal rabbit anti-c-myc antibody that recognizes the 64 kd c-myc human protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentages of cells positive for c-myc (c-myc index) and the intensity of antibody labeling were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> human carotid artery demonstrated minimal, isolated cell staining, with single scattered grains of immunocytochemical staining product seen in SMC nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The myc index was 14.7% +/- 3.5% positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In comparison, SMCs from carotid plaque showed a significant predominance of c-myc immunoreactive cells (89.8% +/- 4%; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The intensity of c-myc staining was greater in plaque SMCs, with many of the cells demonstrating confluence of immunocytochemical precipitate throughout 50% of SMC nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the exact role of enhanced expression of the c-myc protooncogene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is unclear, a cooperative influence of abnormal early cell-cycle gene expression and humoral factors may initiate the atherogenic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The c-myc gene and other protooncogenes are early molecular markers of cell-cycle activity, which may be important in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005296'>occlusive vascular disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
