<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Elevated serum levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a), a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (AS), are also associated with the presence of asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AS is present in some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, but its contribution to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation and growth is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">Apolipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) [apo(a)], the active moiety of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a), is present in atherosclerotic circle of Willis vessels but not in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> circle of Willis vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We wished to determine whether apo(a) is present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> independently of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: With a purified anti-apo(a) monoclonal antibody, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (n = 25) and feeding vessels (n = 23) were examined for apo(a) expression by immunohistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Circle of Willis arteries with and without AS (n = 19), cavernous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angiomas</z:mp> (n = 5), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (n = 6) acted as control samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AS was present in 32% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of those <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> demonstrated mural immunopositivity for apo(a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> devoid of AS also demonstrated apo(a) immunopositivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Apo(a) was demonstrated in 86% of available feeding vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Apo(a) deposition was not observed in cavernous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angiomas</z:mp> but was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven Circle of Willis arteries (57.9%) were devoid of AS and demonstrated no apo(a) immunostaining, whereas the eight (42.1%) with AS were immunopositive for apo(a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Apo(a) expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> may occur independently of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Apo(a) in feeding vessels suggests a possible role for apo(a) in early events leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Multilayered transmural apo(a) deposition in established <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> suggests apo(a) involvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> growth, possibly via cycles of injury and repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The absence of apo(a) in cavernous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angiomas</z:mp> suggests that such injury might be pressure-mediated </plain></SENT>
