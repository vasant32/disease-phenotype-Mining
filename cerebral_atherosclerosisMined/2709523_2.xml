<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, patients with carotid endarterectomy were pretreated with oral <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta carotene</z:chebi> to determine if the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="23044">carotenoid</z:chebi> content and therefore laser selectivity of plaque could be increased in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">Beta carotene</z:chebi>-treated patients had a significant, nearly twofold increase in their plaque <z:chebi fb="2" ids="23044">carotenoid</z:chebi> concentration, which increased from 0.22 to 0.40 microgram <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta carotene</z:chebi>/mg cholesterol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that selective ablation of atherosclerotic plaque may be enhanced by pretreating patients with doses of oral <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta carotene</z:chebi> for short periods of time </plain></SENT>
