<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether antiplatelet therapy following carotid bifurcation endarterectomy influences postoperative survival and whether signs of progression in the plaques harvested at the time of surgery might be a prognostic indicator, a controlled clinical trial was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During 1982 to 1985, 66 patients were recruited, operated on (carotid endarterectomy) and assigned, using the method of adaptive randomisation to the therapy group (n = 32) receiving 1.0 g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) per day, starting day two prior to surgery, or to the control group (n = 34), which remained without antiplatelet medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The plaques harvested at the time of surgery were processed using standard histopathological methods and examined "blindly" by light microscopy for signs of arterio-sclerotic progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The final endpoint was patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The last assessment of the participants survival status was done by June 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 20 patients died, six in the treatment group and 14 in the untreated group, the difference being statistically significant (P less than 0.013 Breslow, P less than 0.029 Mantel) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 27 instances the histo-pathological examination showed signs of progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this subgroup <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> yielded a significant prolongation of patient survival (P less than 0.017 Breslow, P less than 0.048 Mantel) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the remaining patients no signs of cellular infiltration were evident and no influence of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> on patient survival was demonstrable (P less than 0.503 Breslow, P less than 0.390 Mantel) </plain></SENT>
