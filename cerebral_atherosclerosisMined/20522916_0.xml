<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, we have encountered ischemic complications when performing <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>/stenting without EPD for symptomatic intracranial internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here a case of symptomatic intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, which was treated by stenting under proximal protection without ischemic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 54-year-old male was admitted to our hospital complaining of motor <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted image (DWI) in MRI revealed multiple high intensity lesions in the left frontal and parietal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An angiogram demonstrated 80% stenosis in the C5 portion of the left internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>/stenting was performed using an occlusion catheter under proximal protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The occlusion catheter with balloon was placed in the left internal carotid artery of the cervical segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The balloon was inflated to intercept blood flow, and a driver stent was placed following <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative angiography demonstrated that the degree of stenosis had decreased to almost 5% after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>/stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient did not present other neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MRI-DWI did not reveal any ischemic lesions following the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>/stenting under proximal protection using an occlusion catheter is a simple technique, and is considered to be effective for intracranial internal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
