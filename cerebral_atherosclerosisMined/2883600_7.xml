<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To estimate the regional perfusion pressure and possibly the stump pressure during carotid endarterectomy, cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements including a vasodilatory test were performed preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CBF was measured by 133Xe inhalation and emission tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An intravenous dose of 1g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi>) was used as cerebral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients with a clinical history of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (9 cases) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> (27 cases) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine of the patients showed occlusion of the contralateral internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percent flow increase induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi> in the ipsilateral hemisphere correlated to the ICA pressure was measured before clamping (n = 32, r = 0.55, p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 12 of the 36 patients, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi> caused a significant change in the flow distribution indicating a restricted regional vasodilatory capacity and a reduced regional perfusion pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, these 12 patients showed a low stump pressure (less than 50 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, 8 additional patients had uniform CBF increases at the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi> test, but showed low stump pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded, that preoperative tests of the cerebral vasodilational capacity can be used to identify most patients with a low ICA pressure, and a substantial fraction of patients that will develop a low stump pressure upon ICA clamping during operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In these patients with abnormal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi> tests surgical reconstruction is particularly indicated, but, at the same time the perioperative risks are presumably highest in this group </plain></SENT>
