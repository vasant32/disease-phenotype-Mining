<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 26 patients with CT lesions less than 15 mm in diameter, only eight (31%) showed minor angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 30 patients with lesion of 15 mm or more, however, 22 (73%) had abnormal angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of the 22 patients had minor irregularities, three had 25-75% stenosis, five had 75% less than stenosis at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery or the horizontal portion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the notion that a small lesion on CT can result from an occlusion of the perforating artery itself and a larger lesion is much related to the major vessel or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e>, i.e., emboli from the parent artery or heart, obstruction of perforators at their origin by an atheromatous plaque of the horizontal portion of the middle cerebral artery, or terminal zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> due to hemodynamically significant stenotic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with a larger deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on CT, further investigation of the arteries in the carotid-axis and heart is important for determination of therapeutic indication </plain></SENT>
