<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Relations of brachial and central pressures to carotid artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> (intimal-medial thickness and vascular mass), extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (plaque score), and incident cardiovascular events were examined in the Strong Heart Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Central pressures were calculated using radial applanation tonometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 3520 participants, central and brachial pulse pressures were more strongly related to vascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> than were systolic pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Central pulse pressure was more strongly related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 arterial measures than was brachial pulse pressure (r=0.364 versus 0.309 for plaque score; P&lt;0.001 for comparison of Spearman correlation coefficient; r=0.293 versus 0.249 for intimal-medial thickness; P&lt;0.002; r=0.320 versus 0.289 for vascular mass; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, noninvasively-determined central pulse pressure is more strongly related to vascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and cardiovascular events than is brachial blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings support prospective examination of use of central blood pressure as a treatment target in future trials </plain></SENT>
