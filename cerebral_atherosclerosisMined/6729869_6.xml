<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We used three-dimensional proton NMR images to study ischemic infarction in the territory of the vertebral-basilar posterior cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study includes sixteen cases, eight of which are presented in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In seven cases, the infarctions were secondary to demonstrable large artery occlusive disease -- vertebral, basilar, or posterior cerebral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In nine cases, the infarctions were secondary to what was presumably small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In fifteen of the sixteen cases, NMR imaging could locate the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, inversion recovery and spin-echo pulse sequences being more sensitive than the saturation recovery pulse sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This efficiency rests on the high sensitivity of ischemic infarction to changes in T1 and T2 relaxation time, highlighted in the inversion recovery and spin-echo images, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The additional advantages of the three-dimensional approach, and the lack of bone artifact, make NMR imaging superior to CT scanning in identifying areas of infarction in the territory of posterior cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
