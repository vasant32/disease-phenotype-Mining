<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied 8 symptomatic patients aged 32-56 years with isolated stenosis of the middle cerebral artery who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> or minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiography showed <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis in the M1 segment in 7 patients, and proximal M1 occlusion that later recanalized with persistent stenosis in 1 patient, without evidence of more widespread atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A potential cardiac source of embolism was detected in only 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During follow-up for 39-82 months, no further ischemic events occurred, and transcranial Doppler showed unchanged or decreased stenosis in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that isolated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis in younger patients may be a unique pathologic entity with a benign long-term course, although previous embolism with partial recanalization appears possible in some patients </plain></SENT>
