<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ninety-four patients underwent 103 reoperations for primary recurrent stenosis (nine patients had bilateral repairs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two operations (70%) were performed to relieve cerebrovascular symptoms whereas the indication for 31 operations (30%) was high-grade stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cause of primary recurrent stenosis was myointimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> (MIH) in 47 cases, whereas 56 were caused by recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (ASO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary recurrent stenosis developed in six patients from our own series (5.8%) and an additional six patients were referred after reoperation elsewhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 12 lesions in this group were evenly divided between MIH (six) and recurrent ASO (six) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MIH resulted in a single tertiary recurrent stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Myointimectomy or repeat endarterectomy and vein patch angioplasty were the most commonly used techniques for repair of a primary recurrent stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Secondary recurrent stenosis necessitated resection of the carotid bifurcation and graft interposition when caused by MIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Secondary recurrent stenosis caused by ASO could be treated by repeat endarterectomy and vein patch angioplasty in five of six cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred in the entire series (4.3%), resulting in two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were 23 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsies</z:hpo>, which rarely persisted beyond 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The morbidity and mortality rates for primary and secondary carotid reoperation are comparable to the original procedure and should not deter the vascular surgeon from reoperative carotid reconstruction whenever indicated </plain></SENT>
