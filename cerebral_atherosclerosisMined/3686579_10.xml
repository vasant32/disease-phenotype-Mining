<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to test the hypothesis that dietary treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> reverses the augmented cerebral vasoconstrictor response to <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cynomolgus monkeys, atherosclerotic monkeys, and atherosclerotic monkeys that were fed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (regression) diet for 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Morphometric studies indicated that the regression diet reduced intimal area in the carotid arteries by about 50-75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was measured with microspheres, and microvascular pressure was measured with a micropipette in pial arteries that were approximately 300 micron in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Values for cerebral blood flow and arteriolar pressure were used to calculate resistance of large cerebral arteries (greater than 300 micron diameter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Infusion of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> produced a modest increase in the resistance of large cerebral arteries in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vasoconstrictor responses to <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> were increased more than fivefold in atherosclerotic monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The major finding of the study is that dietary treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> abolishes augmented cerebral responses to <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
