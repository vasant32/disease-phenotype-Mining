<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventeen rabbits approximately 34 weeks old and weighing between 3 and 4 Kg were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each rabbit was fed a 1% cholesterol diet for 3 to 4 months to induce <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> in the carotid arteries and the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> laser unit used was a Model 20 Endocoagulator (HMG, Inc.; maximum power, 12W) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Under an angioscope, two bare-ended laser probes (1.5 mm and 0.3 mm in diameter) were used to vaporize atheromatous plaque in the aortas of 10 rabbits, and a metal tip laser probe in the case of seven rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The plaque remaining after this laser angioplasty was compressed to the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface through inflation of a balloon catheter (balloon angioplasty) in order to sufficiently dilate the arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The animals were then sacrificed and examined both macroscopically and microscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the bare-ended probes were used, there was a change in the depth of vaporization in line with the direction of the laser beam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using a laser heating power of 25 J, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> of the vessel wall was observed in 36% of the trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A higher frequency of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> was seen with the 0.3 mm probe than with the 1.5 mm probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, a constant vaporizing effect was achieved using the metal tip laser.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
