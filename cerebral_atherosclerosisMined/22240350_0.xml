<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty six subjects were enrolled onto this study, and sub-divided into two groups: the first group of patients (n = 36) with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> received pentoxifylline therapy (400 mg, thrice daily) for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients of the second group were initially treated with Epoetin beta 10,000 units subcutaneously thrice a week, for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second group - adult anemic patients (n = 30) with the confirmed diagnosis of solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (Hb &lt; 100 g/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 4 weeks of pentoxifylline treatment the red cell aggregation increased (p &lt; 0.05) in the patients with initially low RBCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand in the patients with initially high RBCA treatment with pentoxifylline reduced it markedly (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro experiments with pentoxifylline RBC incubation resulted in a decrease of the initially high RBCA by 47% (p &lt; 0.01), whereas in the sub-group with initially low RBCA it increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was observed that after 4 weeks of epoetin-beta treatment 75% the anemic patients with initially high RBCA had an aggregation lowering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The drop of aggregation was about 34% (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the same time 25% of the study patients had a significant RBCA increase (p &lt; 0.05) after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The initially low red cell aggregation after incubation with epoetin-beta was markedly increased by 122% (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the contrary initially high RBCA was reduced by 47% (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> (10 Î¼M) was added to the RBC suspensions the RBCA was increased in sub-group of subjects with initially low aggregation and it was decreased in sub-group with initially high one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The similar RBCA changes were observed when RBC suspensions were incubated with vinpocetine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> (A23187), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">Phorbol</z:chebi> 12-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> 13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>) as a protein kinase C (PKC) stimulator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A major finding of this study is that the red cell aggregation effects of some drugs depend markedly on the initial, pre-treatment aggregation status of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that the different red blood cell aggregation responses to the biological stimuli depend strongly on the initial, pre-treatment status of the subject and the most probably it is connected with the crosstalk between the adenylyl cyclase signaling pathway and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> regulatory mechanism </plain></SENT>
