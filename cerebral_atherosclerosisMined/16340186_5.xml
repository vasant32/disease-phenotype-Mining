<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A difference with regard to the correlation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (CAS) between extracranial carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (ECAS) and intracranial cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (ICAS) has been assumed but not proven clearly by direct comparison within the same population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A consecutive series of 246 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The severity of CAS was estimated as a CAS score based on coronary angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of ECAS and ICAS was screened by transcranial Doppler and carotid duplex sonography, and confirmed by magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CAS scores in patients with ECAS were observed to be higher than those in patients without ECAS (10.62+/- 4.80 vs. 9.45+/- 4.25; p=0.054 on the Mann-Whitney U test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The difference in CAS scores was smaller between patients with and without ICAS (10.41+/- 4.44 vs. 9.66+/- 4.49; p=0.201) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar patterns were observed on comparing the correlation of ECAS and ICAS with a quartile of the CAS score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An advanced CAS, which was generated by collapsing the quartiles of the CAS score into 75th percentile or less and more than the 75th percentile, was significantly associated with ECAS, but not with ICAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These associations remained unchanged after adjustments had been made for age, sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, smoking and a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the correlation of CAS with ECAS is stronger than that of CAS with ICAS, and this difference is independent of the classic risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
