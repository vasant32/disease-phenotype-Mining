<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A well-defined rate of adverse events following cerebral angiography in patients with symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> would be useful to physicians making decisions regarding imaging and treatment of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the adverse events associated with angiography in patients who underwent single-vessel cerebral angiography as part of the study protocol in the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi>-Aspirin for Symptomatic Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>Arterial Stenosis</z:hpo> trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Single-vessel cerebral angiography was performed to specifically define the degree of stenosis in 196 patients suspected of having intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis on noninvasive tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adverse events that occurred within 24 h of cerebral angiography were reported by the sites performing the angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, neurological adverse events occurred in 4 patients (2.0%; 95% CI: 0.6-5.1%), and nonneurological adverse events occurred in 12 patients (6.1%; 95% CI: 3.2-10.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the neurological adverse events were transient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk of permanent neurological adverse events associated with single-vessel cerebral angiography in patients with symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is relatively low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The quantification of the risk of cerebral angiography in patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> provides useful information to consider when evaluating noninvasive imaging techniques for their relative value </plain></SENT>
