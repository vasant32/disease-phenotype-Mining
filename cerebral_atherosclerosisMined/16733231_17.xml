<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: C-reactive protein (CRP) is reported to be involved in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elevated CRP levels are considered to be a predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (IS) in elderly individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) are reportedly associated with elevated CRP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to genotype some of the SNP in the human CRP gene and to assess the association between the CRP gene and IS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Japanese patients with IS (72.4 +/- 8.2 years of age, n = 152) and elderly Japanese subjects without IS (78.0 +/- 4.2 years of age, n = 304) were genotyped for four SNP of the human CRP gene: rs1341665, rs1800947, rs1130864, and rs1205 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each genotyping was performed using the TaqMan SNP genotyping assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The haplotype-based association study was assessed with a permutation test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The genotype rs1800947 was statistically significant between patients with IS and control subjects (CC+GC versus GG variant, P = .016 by multiple logistic regression analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This analysis revealed that the CC+GC variant of rs1800947 was an independent risk factor of IS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four SNP were located in one haplotype block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The haplotype was constructed using rs1341665, rs1800947, and rs1130864, in that order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association between IS and the C-C-C haplotype (P = .015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rs1800947 SNP and the C-C-C haplotype in the CRP gene appear to be prognostic markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and this polymorphism could be a useful genetic marker </plain></SENT>
