<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the unknown fraction of hemodynamic functional anterior and posterior communicating arteries (AcoA and PcoA, respectively) in an atherosclerotic population with no cerebrovascular symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 76 patients with a mean age of 61 (35 to 89) years, the blood flow velocity changes in the precommunicating parts (A1 and P1, respectively) of the anterior and posterior cerebral arteries were measured during CCA compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The AcoA was defined as functional if blood flow was reversed in the ipsilateral A1 and enhanced in the contralateral A1 during CCA compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PcoA was defined as functional if the flow velocity in the P1 was enhanced &gt;20% during ipsilateral CCA compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: It was possible to assess cross flow through the anterior part of the circle of Willis in 95% of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Failure of this collateral pathway was caused by a hypofunctional AcoA in 4% and a hypofunctional A1 in 1% of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anomalies in the posterior part of the circle of Willis hampering collateral flow from the basilar to the internal carotid artery were found in 45% of the hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight percent of PcoAs were hypofunctional, and 7% of the posterior cerebral arteries had a persistent fetal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found that in subjects with no cerebrovascular symptoms, the anterior collateral pathway of the circle of Willis was nearly always functional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the posterior collateral pathway was nonfunctional in almost half of the total number of hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Comparing these basic data with data from patients with cerebral ischemic disease might further help to elucidate the importance of the collateral capacity of the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
