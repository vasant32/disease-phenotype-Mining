<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> are rarely associated with symptomatic intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the results of recanalization by stent placement in patients with symptomatic severe intracranial stenosis associated with adjacent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 139 patients who underwent intracranial stent placement during a 5-year period, 10 (7%) had symptomatic severe intracranial stenosis associated with adjacent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five were in the VA, 3 in the BA, and 2 in M1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were atherosclerotic fusiform (n = 5), ulcerative (n = 4), and saccular (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed angiographic findings based on biplane and 3D angiograms and assessed patient outcomes and complications after stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with those of a control group without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> who underwent stent placement during the same study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysm</z:hpo> locations were post- (n = 6), in- (n = 2), and pre-stenotic (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After angioplasty with stent placement and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> embolization, there were no lesion-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> during a median follow-up period of 25 months (range, 11-43 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient had asymptomatic restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The final mRS score was good (â‰¤2) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences in event or restenosis rates compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adjacent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were rarely associated with severe intracranial stenosis but were more common in the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Intracranial stent placement may be performed without additional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk, regardless of the type and location of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
