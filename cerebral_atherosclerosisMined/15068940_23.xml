<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of undersized stents used in patients with high-grade intracranial stenosis and recurrent ischemic symptoms who are undergoing medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 18 patients (13 men, five women; age range, 51-82 years), 20 high-grade (&gt;70%) intracranial stenoses were selected for stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had transient ischemic symptoms or minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> while undergoing combined antithrombotic therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> or anticoagulation therapy with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Technical success was defined as reaching the target lesion and deploying a stent, with a residual stenosis of less than 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the stent was 0.5-mm smaller than the measured diameter of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adjacent vessel to avoid dissection and vessel rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoints for safety evaluation were the combined incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or major or minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at 30 days; for efficacy evaluation, the primary endpoint was the incidence of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the treated vascular territory within the first 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical evaluation of the reduction of stenosis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 18 of 20 stenoses, a stent was placed and the degree of stenosis was reduced from a median of 82% (range, 72%-97%) to a median of 16% (5%-40%; P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The technical success rate was 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient had a parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in a preexisting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on the 2nd day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the 30-day combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No immediate complication, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, dissection compromising blood flow, or vessel rupture occurred during these procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Within the first 6 months after intervention, no patient had new ischemic symptoms in the treated vascular territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In selected patients with recurrent ischemic events due to high-grade intracranial stenosis, undersized stent placement holds promise as an effective and safe procedure </plain></SENT>
