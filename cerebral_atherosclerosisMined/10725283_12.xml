<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The dynamic sequence of this event has not been fully elucidated in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In 7 patients with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and critical (&gt;70%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, autologous native [(125)I]-labeled <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> or [(125)I]-labeled human serum albumin were injected 24 to 72 hours before endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carotid specimens obtained at endarterectomy were analyzed by autoradiography and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autoradiographic study showed that <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> was localized prevalently in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003651'>foam cells</z:hpo> of atherosclerotic plaques, whereas the accumulation in the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> core was negligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003651'>foam cells</z:hpo> that had accumulated radiolabeled <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> were mostly CD68 positive, whereas a small number were alpha-actin positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No accumulation of the radiotracer was detected in atherosclerotic plaques after injection of radiolabeled human serum albumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients treated for 4 weeks with vitamin E (900 mg/d), an almost complete suppression of radiolabeled <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> uptake by macrophages was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that circulating <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> rapidly accumulates in human atherosclerotic plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalent accumulation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> by macrophages provides strong support to the hypothesis that these cells play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
