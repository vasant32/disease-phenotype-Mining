<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It remains unclear whether white-coat <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is associated with vascular organ damage (e.g., carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>) in the same way sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore compared the progression of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> among Japanese individuals showing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood pressures, sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or white-coat <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 30 subjects (mean age, 58 years) with white-coat <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, 30 (mean age, 54 years) with untreated sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> who had no plaque formation in the carotid arteries, and 30 normotensive subjects (mean age, 58 years) were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The white-coat and sustained hypertensive subjects were matched with respect to their clinical blood pressures, but their ambulatory blood pressures differed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, white-coat hypertensive and normotensive subjects were matched with respect to ambulatory blood pressures, but their clinical blood pressures differed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carotid intimal-medial thickness was measured by B-mode ultrasonography, and the cross-sectional area of the common carotid artery was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The three groups were similar with respect to age, sex ratio, height, laboratory data and the incidence of smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Body weights and body mass indexes were significantly higher among patients with sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> than among either normotensive or white-coat hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intimal-medial thicknesses and carotid cross-sectional areas were similar in patients with white-coat and sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and significantly higher than in normotensive subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these findings suggest that white-coat <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> contributed to the presence of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> in our subjects in a manner similar to sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, clinical evaluation of white-coat <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> should be conducted with the potential for target organ damage in mind </plain></SENT>
