<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 523 patients in the rehabilitation phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (outside the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase reaction after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) were tested for blood, serum and plasma viscosity, haematocrit, fibrinogen, red cell aggregation and deformability, ESR, white cell count, cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endpoints were defined as a second <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (lethal or not) within 2 years after the initial examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients suffering such endpoints exhibit elevated blood viscosity, red cell aggregation, plasma and serum viscosity, fibrinogen and cholesterol levels, compared to patients without endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that rheological factors are associated with the prognosis after a first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
