<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> and increased oxidation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (oxLDL) through free radical-mediated tissue injury may be important factors in the development of extracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the roles of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> in intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is less established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The induction of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase (HO) is a cellular response to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, and inducible HO (HO-1) may protect against oxidized <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> such as those produced by <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of oxLDL on cell and tissue viability, HO-1 and ferritin expression in extracranial and intracranial endothelial cells, and the arteries of cholesterol-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (CIA) Japanese quail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report that cultured microvascular endothelial cells from the brain (QBMEC) and carotid (QCEC) differ in their response to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The QCECs are less responsive than QBMECs to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> induced by oxLDL, as evident by lower expression of HO-1 mRNA, HO activity, and ferritin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the higher levels of catalytic iron, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> reactive substances, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase released in QCECs indicated that these cells are more susceptible to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> than QBMECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the relationship between extent of atherosclerotic plaque deposition and the extracranial and intracranial arterial expression of HO-1 in quail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The common carotid and vertebral (extracranial) arteries had higher tissue cholesterol levels (starting at 2 weeks of cholesterol-supplementation) and a greater atherosclerotic plaque score (starting at 4 weeks of cholesterol-supplementation) compared with middle cerebral and basilar (intracranial) arteries, and this may be relevant to the effect of aging on the process of atherogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The extracranial arteries also had early and greater levels of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and catalytic iron coupled with lower expression of HO-1 protein, HO activity, and ferritin compared to the intracranial vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that the extracranial and intracranial arterial walls respond differently to oxidation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi>, and support the feasibility of increased HO-1 expression as a means of protection against oxidant injury </plain></SENT>
