<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study aimed to see whether the location of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis (proximal vs distal) determines the location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 62 consecutive patients who developed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (&lt;72 h) infarction either on the CR or IC confirmed by diffusion-weighted MRI due to corresponding focal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> M1 stenosis assessed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distance between the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> origin and the centre of stenotic portion (S) and that between the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> origin and its bifurcation site (M) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the S/M ratio, stenotic lesions were divided into "proximal' and "distal' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the location of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> and the location of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen of 31 patients (41.9%) with proximal M1 stenosis had IC lesions, while 26 (83.9%) of 31 patients with distal stenosis had CR lesions (p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The S/M ratio in patients with the CR <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (mean (SD) 0.65 (0.21) was significantly greater than in those with the IC <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (0.48 (0.23)) (p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score at admission was higher in patients with proximal M1 stenosis than in those with distal stenosis (6 vs 3.5; p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that perforating arteries arising from the distal M1 segment are related to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> involving the upper part of pyramidal tract, while those from proximal segment are related to lower lesions </plain></SENT>
