<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the described group of the patients with multiple occlusive lesions of the cerebral arteries, the pathogenesis of betolepsy is obviously connected with a decrease of the arteriovenous gradient of cerebral circulation to the level close to the critical one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this case, enhancement of the cerebral blood flow attained by different approaches including reconstructive operations on cerebral vessels rather than administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsants</z:chebi> is an effective means of counteracting betolepsy </plain></SENT>
