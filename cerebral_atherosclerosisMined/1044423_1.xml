<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Review of the epidemiology of atherothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (ABI) based largely on 18 years of prospective data from the Framingham cohort reveals that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is a potent force in morbidity and mortality, that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is its dominant precursor, that it can be predicted and suggests that only a preventive approach can substantially reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data from Framingham on the relative frequency of the major types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> found in the community reveal that 57 percent are due to ABI and only 17 percent to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>--two-thirds of which is subarachnoid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are common accounting for 13 percent of ABI's in men and 23 percent in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite the sizeable geographic, seasonal and secular trends in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mortality, few environmental determinants of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have been uncovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, established hallmarks of the candidate for an atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> include: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (systolic or diastolic), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo>, high <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, the cigarette habit (men only), abnormal <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> (under age 60) and cardiac impairments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many unresolved issues remain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, it is possible to identify a tenth of the general population from which half the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> will emerge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This provides a rational basis for establishing a program of prevention </plain></SENT>
