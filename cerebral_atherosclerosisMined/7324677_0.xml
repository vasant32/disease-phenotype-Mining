<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these patients the ischemic focus was localized in the brain hemispheres within the basin of the median or posterior cerebral arteries and manifested in moderate focal symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The disturbances usually arose some months or years after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and pointed, as a rule, to an insufficiency of the circulation in the brain trunk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The appearance of the transitory cerebral circulation disturbances after an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> may be, probably, a consequence and manifested in moderate focal symptoms </plain></SENT>
