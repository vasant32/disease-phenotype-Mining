<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the latter syndrome the working capacity was lowered as a result of less economical work of the circulatory apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular, physical loading in such patients was accompanied by marked increment of the heart rate and blood pressure elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased heart oxygen requirement in the second group patients during exercise was accompanied by more frequent ischemic alterations in the myocardium attended by ST segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> on the ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that concomitant cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> aggravates the basic pathogenetic mechanisms of CHD, namely the disagreement between myocardium oxygen requirement and supply </plain></SENT>
