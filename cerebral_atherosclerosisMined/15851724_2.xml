<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the distribution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (a) (apo[a]) isoforms and their relation to the clinical severity of different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-four hospital cases with a first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and 188 randomly selected control subjects matched for age, gender, and ethnicity were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> etiology was defined according to Trial of Org 10172 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Treatment criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) was used to assess the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In univariate analysis, the presence of at least one small apo(a) isoform was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in men (p = 0.02) but not in women (p = 0.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After allowance for age, gender and traditional vascular risk factors, subjects carrying at least one small apo(a) isoform were at increased risk of atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR] 7.1, 95% CI 2.8 to 17.5, p = 0.00001) but not of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.5 to 2.7, p = 0.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that in the atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group, the presence of at least one small-sized apo(a) phenotype was associated with an NIHSS score &gt; or =6 (OR 13.6, 95% CI 1.6 to 111.9, p = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Small <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (a) isoforms distinguish atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> and are associated with the severity of atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
