<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After a short description of the different subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and their age distribution the possible risk factors are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The leading factor is arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, but smoking, <z:mp ids='MP_0001548'>hyperlipemia</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> are not held to be definite risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In spite of the positive correlation between age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence, aging is probably not a risk factor by itself, but it is accompanied by higher frequencies of other risk factors </plain></SENT>
