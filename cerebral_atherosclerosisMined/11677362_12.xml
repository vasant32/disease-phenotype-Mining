<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported that the circulating concentration of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was increased in individuals with clinically overt atherosclerotic disease, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whether changes in the circulating concentration of HGF are associated with early atherosclerotic changes in apparently healthy individuals remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the plasma concentration of HGF and carotid arterial remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma concentrations of HGF were measured in 201 community-dwelling healthy residents free from any medications and signs and history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carotid intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) and carotid internal diameter were determined by ultrasonography with a 7.5 MHz probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study participants were divided into four groups according to the presence or absence of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (presence of plaque, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> &gt; or = 0.85 mm) and carotid arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (diameter &gt; or = 7.0 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Carotid arterial remodeling, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, or combinations thereof, was associated with significantly greater concentrations of plasma HGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among risk factors, plasma HGF was significantly associated with advanced age (&gt; or = 65 years), current smoking and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, whereas sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> did not affect plasma concentrations of HGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis showed that plasma HGF was independently associated with carotid arterial remodeling (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, or both) in addition to age and systolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the plasma concentration of HGF increases in relation to carotid arterial remodeling, independently of known risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings further support a possible role of HGF in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
