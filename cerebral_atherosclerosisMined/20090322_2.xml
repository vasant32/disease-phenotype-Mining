<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several angiographic patterns distal to severe M1 stenosis have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have assessed the relationship between these angiographic patterns and patient presenting symptoms, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patterns, perfusion status and outcome after recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three angiographic patterns were retrospectively identified in 60 patients (M:F = 41:19; age range = 34-80 years, mean = 55) who underwent M1 stenting: (1) a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern (n = 22); (2) a shift pattern of the borderzone of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) down to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> side with <z:mp ids='MP_0001265'>decreased size</z:mp> of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branches (n = 16), and (3) a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> pattern of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branches with slow flow and minimal shift of borderzone (n = 22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, to analyze interreader agreement, we assessed the correlation between angiographic patterns and gender, presenting symptoms (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> vs. <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patterns on MRI (borderzone vs. non-borderzone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>), perfusion results and outcome after stenting by chi(2) or Fisher's exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Blind review revealed an excellent interreader agreement in the assessment of angiographic patterns (kappa = 0.681) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The shift pattern was more common in women than in men (p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The likelihood of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (25/60, 42%, p = 0.001), borderzone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (21/32, 66%, p = 0.010) and decreased perfusion (p &lt; 0.001) were greatest in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> pattern, followed by shift and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The outcomes did not differ by angiographic pattern probably due to the low event rate (4/60, 6.7%) within 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe M1 stenosis had 3 different angiographic patterns, which correlated with presenting symptoms, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patterns and perfusion status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Differences in patterns may be related to variation in collateral circulation at the ACA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> borderzone and hypoperfusion status </plain></SENT>
