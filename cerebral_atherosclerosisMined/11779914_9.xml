<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred forty-two men and women participated in a population study at ages 70 and 76 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At age 78, extracranial and intracranial circulation was examined by means of duplex sonography and transcranial Doppler techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mortality and hospitalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were analyzed over a 5-year follow-up period up to age 83 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Carotid plaques were identified in 82% of the men and 79% of the women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bilateral plaques were found in 57% of the men and 46% of the women, and stenosis resulting in &gt;50% diameter reduction occurred in 28% of the men and 17% of the women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>Carotid stenosis</z:hpo> &gt;75% was observed in 7 subjects (0.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bilateral plaques at age 78 were correlated with systolic blood pressure and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> at age 70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pulsatility index was 1.0 to 1.4 in 63% and &gt; or =1.5 in 13% of the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pulsatility index was correlated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Men with bilateral carotid plaques at age 78 years had an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or mortality during the 5-year follow-up period (74% bilateral plaques versus 21% unilateral or no plaques) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This was not found in the women (33% versus 26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was prevalent in a majority of elderly subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Bilateral plaques were correlated with systolic blood pressure and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> at age 70 years and predicted the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and mortality in men but not in women </plain></SENT>
