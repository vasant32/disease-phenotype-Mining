<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the frequency, clinical course, and functional outcome of perforator <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (PS) resulting from elective stenting of symptomatic intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between September 2001 and November 2004, 169 consecutive patients with 181 symptomatic intracranial stenoses underwent stenting procedure at our institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The preoperative perforator <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> adjacent to the stenotic segment (PIAS) on MRI was evaluated blindly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who developed PS after stenting were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each patient was assessed by an experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> neurologist by neurologic examination and NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score every day until discharge and at day 30, and by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at the end of the first, third, and sixth month, and then at intervals of 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PS frequency was 3.0% (5/169 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients with preoperative PIAS had a higher frequency of PS and PS exacerbation, resulting from intracranial stenting (8.2%, 4/49), vs patients without preoperative PIAS (0.8%, 1/120; p = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four PSs occurred during the procedure and one 10 hours after stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four PSs reached the maximum deficit almost at once, and one after 2 hours from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five patients were functionally independent (mRS &lt;or= 1) within 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with preoperative perforator <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> adjacent to the stenotic segment have a higher perforator <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> frequency after elective stenting of intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most perforator <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occur during the procedure and reach the maximum deficit almost immediately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Functional outcomes are relatively good </plain></SENT>
