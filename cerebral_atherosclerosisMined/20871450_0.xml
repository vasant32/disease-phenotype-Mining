<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Elective stenting for intracranial stenosis is under study as an effective means of reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At most institutions, these procedures are performed and monitored after the induction of general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report our success with elective intracranial stenting and angioplasty performed in conscious patients after the administration of mild <z:chebi fb="35" ids="35717">sedatives</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="39" ids="36333">local anesthetic</z:chebi> agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated data from 66 patients who underwent elective intracranial stenting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one procedures were performed under local anesthesia with mild sedation; 3 were performed under general anesthesia, and 2 were converted from local to general anesthesia during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraprocedural neurological changes were monitored and led to reevaluation of technique, immediate reimaging, modifying the endovascular procedure itself, or possibly mandating conversion to general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-nine anterior and 27 posterior circulation stenotic segments were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiographic success was achieved in 95.5% of patients with an overall reduction in stenosis of 75.5 to 22.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous angioplasty and stenting were used in 58 cases; 8 patients were treated with stenting alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients (4.9%) developed neurological deficits mandating alteration or adjustment of endovascular technique or immediate postoperative management to avoid permanent sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A total of 8 periprocedural complications occurred, 2 of which resulted in permanent neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality rate was 3.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stenting of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> performed under conscious sedation is associated with complication rates and effectiveness similar to historical rates for general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conscious sedation confers the additional benefit of continuous neurological assessment during the procedure </plain></SENT>
