<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Plasma hyperviscosity is a striking abnormality in patients suffering from subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (SAE) and is thought to perpetuate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ischaemic demyelinating process of the periventricular white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ancrod, a defibrinating enzyme, was given to 10 patients with SAE in an attempt to reduce plasma fibrinogen, which would thus normalise hyperviscosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was paralleled by a significant improvement of the initially abnormal <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arteriovenous passage time, as well as a significant augmentation of the <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>-induced cerebral vasomotor response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This did not lead, however, to any clinical improvement with respect to performance of neuropsychological tests, recurrences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> during a 6 month observation period or improvement of various audiological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings indicate that hyperviscosity in patients with SAE is merely an epiphenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A potentially reversible, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> penumbral state of the brain tissue apparently does not exist in SAE </plain></SENT>
