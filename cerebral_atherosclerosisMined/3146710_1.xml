<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alterations of CBF can be detected in symptom-free intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cerebrovascular reactivity to <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> stimulus is regarded as an especially suitable tool to prove the cerebrovascular reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If it is diminished, cerebral angiography should be carried out since it will often show major obstructive lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography shows no sure correlation between CBF and collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Strong opthalmic pathways in unilateral occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) often coincide with compensated or only slightly alterated CBF and relatively small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In about 70% of cases of ICA occlusion, CT shows an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> mostly in region of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Largest <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were found in the anterior area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although resting CBF was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 55% of cases of unilateral ICA occlusion, <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity was impaired in 68% of these Cases </plain></SENT>
