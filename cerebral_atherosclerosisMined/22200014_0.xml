<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Stenting of symptomatic intracranial stenosis has recently become an alternative treatment modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, urgent intracranial stenting in patients with intracranial stenosis following a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) or minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is open to dispute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to assess the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of urgent intracranial stenting for severe stenosis (&gt;70%) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between June 2009 and October 2010, stent-assisted angioplasty by using a balloon-expandable coronary stent for intracranial severe stenosis (&gt;70%) was performed in 7 patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and 5 patients after minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (14 stenotic lesions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Technical success rates, complications, angiographic findings, and clinical outcomes were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Stenting was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean time from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to stenting was 2.1 days (1-8 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Post-procedural angiography showed restoration to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In-stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurred in one patient (n=1, 8.3%), and was lysed with abciximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No device-related complications, such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> or dissections at the target arteries or intracranial hemorrhaging, occurred in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patient had an ischemic event over the mean follow-up period of 12.5 months (range, 7-21 months), and follow-up angiography (n=7) revealed no significant in-stent restenosis (&gt;50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Urgent recanalization with stenting is feasible, safe, and effective in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with intracranial stenosis of â‰¥70% </plain></SENT>
