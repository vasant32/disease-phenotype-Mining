<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous cross-sectional studies in patients with subcortical vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (SVE) have shown little or no correlation between brain lesion load and clinical disability, which could be due to the low specificity of T2-weighted MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have indicated that T1-weighted MRI may be more specific than T2-weighted MRI for severe tissue destruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 37 patients with a diagnosis of SVE and 11 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls with standardised T1- and T2-weighted MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent detailed clinical assessment including a neuropsychological test battery and computerised gait analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both the T2- and T1-weighted total MRI lesion loads different between patients and controls different, particularly T1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ratio of T2-/T1-weighted lesion load was lower in controls than in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no overall correlation of T1- or T2-weighted lesion load with clinical disability, but group comparison of patients with severe and mild clinical deficits showed different lesion loads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that T1- and T2-weighted MRI lesion loads demonstrate relevant structural abnormality in patients with SVE </plain></SENT>
