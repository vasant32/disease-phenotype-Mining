<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The correlation revealed between the signs under study showed them to be genetically determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 47.6% of cases, predisposition to CA was determined by genes regulating the level of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and in only 25%, by genes monitoring the level of cholesterol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The values of genetic correlations between the predisposition to CA and the level of individual classes of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> are accounted for by the presence of genes displaying a pleiotropic effect on pair signs </plain></SENT>
