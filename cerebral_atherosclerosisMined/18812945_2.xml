<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We describe our initial experience with the use of a novel, compliant guide catheter designed for placement within the cranial vasculature in a series of seven patients who were treated for various intracranial pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Seven patients were deemed to have either tortuous supra-aortic, intracranial, and/or extracranial vasculature or to require additional microcatheter support as the result of lesion location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: The patients were treated, in part, with the 6-French Neuron delivery catheter (Penumbra, Inc., San Leandro, CA) at the authors' two institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The guide catheter was positioned in various distal locations within the intracranial internal carotid artery or external carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients were treated for unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, 2 patients for intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, 1 patient for an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo>, and 1 patient for a pseudoaneurysm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lesions were successfully treated through a microcatheter advanced in a coaxial fashion through the guide catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no complications related to the positioning of the catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Distal intra- or extracranial placement of a specially designed, compliant guide catheter can be performed safely and may improve access and microcatheter stability in patients with tortuous vessels or difficult-to-reach lesions </plain></SENT>
