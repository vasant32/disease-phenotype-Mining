<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a) [lp(a)] in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with large and small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 71 patients being 3 to 12 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (including 30 subjects with large vessel disease and 41 subjects with small vessel disease) and 30 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We excluded patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of cardioembolic, rare or uncertain etiology, subjects with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo>, hypo- or hyperthyreoidism, hepatic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo>, and treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> or fibrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed basal <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> fractions and nephelometrically measured the concentration of lp(a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of total and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> were similar in studied groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with large vessel disease had lower levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> and higher levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> than patients with small vessel disease and than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median concentrations of lp(a) were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studied groups (8.4 mg/dl in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients; 10.85 mg/dl in large vessel disease; 7.7 mg/dl in small vessel disease and 6.3 mg/dl in controls; p = n.s.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentage of subjects with increased lp(a) concentrations (i.e. &gt; 30 mg/dl) was greater in large vessel disease (36.7%) than in small vessel disease (12.2%; p &lt; 0.05) and in controls (10%; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of basal <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> fractions were similar in subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and with increased concentration of lp(a), both in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and in controls </plain></SENT>
