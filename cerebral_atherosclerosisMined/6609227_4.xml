<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed a thread-like internal carotid artery and an occluded external carotid artery on the side of the ischemic neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computerized tomography and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi>-99m-pertechnetate brain scintigraphy 2 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28177">theophylline</z:chebi> (220 mg) reduced CBF in the unaffected hemisphere and caused a slight increase in the previously maximally hypoperfused area ("inverse steal") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After surgery, the flow pattern practically normalized and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>'s disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CBF measurements before surgery and also after the injection of the vasoactive drugs indicated that focal hemodynamic insufficiency elicited the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>'s, and pointed at a low mean arterial blood pressure of about 35 mm Hg in the affected hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The perioperative finding of a mean blood pressure in the internal carotid artery of 31 mm Hg on the symptomatic side confirmed that the brain tissue had a severely reduced perfusion pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On clamping the artery, a stump pressure of 22 mm Hg and electroencephalogram flattening was noted, so a temporary internal shunt was inserted </plain></SENT>
