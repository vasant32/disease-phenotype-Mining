<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the preceding stage of the arterial lesions, marked <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of medial smooth muscle cells and increase of basement membrane-like substance in the intima and media were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lumina of these arteries were slightly dilated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and hemodynamic factors were supposed to cause endothelial injury resulting in blood plasma insudation into the intima through the opened spaces between endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The insudated blood plasma dispersed and dissolved the basement membrane-like substance, collagen and elastic fibers in the arterial wall, leading to the development of the plasmatic arterionecrosis </plain></SENT>
