<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> occurs later and is less extensive in intracranial arteries than in extracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms responsible are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A previous study has suggested a better <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> protection of intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To assess the influence of age on arterial activity of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes and atherogenesis, we compared intracranial and extracranial arteries of humans of different ages who retrospectively lacked confounding classic risk factors (48 premature fetuses aged 6.4+/-0.8 months [mean+/-SD], 58 children aged 7.9+/-3.8 years, 42 adults aged 42.5+/-5.1 years, and 40 elderly subjects aged 71.8+/-3.4 years; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> males) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesions were quantified by computer-assisted imaging analysis of sections of the middle cerebral and basilar arteries, the left anterior descending coronary artery, the common carotid artery, and the abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Macrophages, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B, oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in lesions were determined by immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of aging on atherogenesis was then compared with that on the activity of 4 antioxidant enzymes in the arterial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was 6- to 19-fold greater (P&lt;0.01) in extracranial arteries than in intracranial arteries, and it increased linearly with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intracranial arteries showed significantly greater <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme activities than did extracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> protection of intracranial arteries decreased significantly in older age, coinciding with a marked acceleration of atherogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An increase in matrix metalloproteinase-9 protein expression and in gelatinolytic activity consistent with the degree of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a greater activity of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes in intracranial arteries may contribute to their greater resistance to atherogenesis and that with increasing age intracranial arteries respond with accelerated atherogenesis when their <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> protection decreases relatively more than that of extracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
