<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Borderzone as well as territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> can occur in severe atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It remains controversial whether the borderzone distribution of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> is due to hypoperfusion or due to artery-to-artery embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The present study investigates whether <z:chebi fb="240" ids="27638">cobalt</z:chebi>-55 (55Co) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) shows a different pattern of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> according to the topography of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in severe atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five patients with a cortical borderzone and seven with a territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, due to symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e>, were investigated with 55Co PET 3-6 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Average 55Co counts in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, the adjacent cortical zone, the deep white matter and, contralateral cerebral cortex and white matter, were compared to the values in the cerebellum used as reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No differences in 55Co ratio were observed in the different regions of interest (ROIs) between patients with cortical borderzone and those with territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 55Co uptake was similar or lower than the reference value for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ROIs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with borderzone as well as with territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> no evidence was found for subclinical ischaemic injury in or around the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data do support the conclusion that cortical borderzone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> may not be due to ongoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> haemodynamic impairment, but by no means is this conclusive evidence </plain></SENT>
