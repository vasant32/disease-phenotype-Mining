<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients of advanced or old age assumes a general character and the incidence of the combined involvement of different vascular regions increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The identification of the atherosclerotic process in patients of advances age is accompanied by an increase in the disturbances of the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and carbohydrate metabolisms in the immunological system and the system of haemocoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are differences in the degree of such metabolic disturbances in older patients which depend on the localization of the atherosclerotic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The strongest disturbances of the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and carbohydrate metabolism and in the immune reactivity occur in connection with coronary and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Less frequent are metabolic disturbances and impairments of the immune reactivity in the case of peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> obliterans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Obviously, it is not only general changes in the organism but also local factors that play an important part with regard to this type of localization of the process such as deteriorated trophism of the tissue, changes in the vascular wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is in general characterized by an increased haemocoagulation there exist differences depending on the various localizations of the vascular process </plain></SENT>
