<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The study was approved by the local ethics committee, and informed consent was provided by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants prior to the examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to assess the feasibility of whole-body three-dimensional (3D) contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) angiography with parallel imaging in the phase- and section-encoding directions (ie, integrated parallel acquisition technique [iPAT(2); Siemens, Erlangen, Germany]) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> anatomic imaging stations in combination with a single injection of contrast material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whole-body contrast-enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography was performed in 23 patients at 3.0 T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Images were evaluated by two independent observers for quality on a four-point scale (where a score of 1 indicated poor image quality and a score of 4, excellent image quality); signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and contrast-to-noise ratios (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50807">CNRs</z:chebi>) were calculated for representative vessel regions in each station </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean image quality scores were 3.13 +/- 1.15 (standard deviation) and 3.17 +/- 1.14 for observers 1 and 2, respectively (kappa = 0.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Signal intensity measurements revealed mean SNR values between 36.2 +/- 8.0 and 56.2 +/- 17.7 and mean <z:chebi fb="11" ids="50807">CNR</z:chebi> values between 29.0 +/- 7.4 and 48.2 +/- 15.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that contrast-enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography with iPAT(2) is feasible for whole-body applications and allows acquisition of 3D data sets with adequate spatial resolution within short measurement times, facilitating a single injection of contrast material </plain></SENT>
