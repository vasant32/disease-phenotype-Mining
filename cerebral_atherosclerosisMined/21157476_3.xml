<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated collaterals in a multicenter trial of symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline angiography was reviewed for information on collaterals in stenoses of the internal carotid, middle cerebral, vertebral, and basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A battery of angiographic scales was utilized to evaluate lesion site, arterial patency, antegrade flow, downstream territorial perfusion, and collateral circulation, blinded to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Collateral circulation was adequately available for analysis in 287/569 (50%) subjects with proximal arterial stenoses ranging from 50% to 99% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extent of collaterals was absent or none in 69%, slow or minimal in 10%, more rapid, yet incomplete perfusion of territory in 7%, complete but delayed perfusion in 11%, and rapid, complete collateral perfusion in 4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extent of collateral flow correlated with percentage of stenosis (P&lt;0.0001), with more severe stenoses exhibiting greater compensation via collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, collateral grade increased with diminished antegrade flow across the lesion (thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e>) and resultant downstream perfusion (thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>) (both P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings provide the initial detailed description of collaterals across a variety of stenoses, suggesting that collateral perfusion is a pivotal component in pathophysiology of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and implicating the need for further evaluation in ongoing studies </plain></SENT>
