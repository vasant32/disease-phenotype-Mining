<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To demonstrate that the in vivo flow from individual vertebral arteries can be imaged and tracked in the basilar artery by use of saturation planes with three-dimensional time of flight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty volunteers were studied with intracranial three-dimensional time of flight angiography <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography was repeated with saturation of the individual vertebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow voids and signal intensity within the basilar and posterior cerebral arteries were evaluated for flow patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 15 volunteers with a "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" vertebrobasilar <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, 80% demonstrated a pattern of flow within the basilar artery in which the contributing vertebral components remained ipisilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This pattern was called "parallel." A "spiral" pattern of rotation of the contributing vertebral components was found in 20% of studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The inflow to the posterior cerebral arteries could be identified from specific vertebral contributions and was related to the size-dominance of the vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is nonadmixture of vertebral artery flows of variable duration within the basilar artery; at least two patterns of flow can be described within the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The method presented is a simple technique for determining vertebral artery flow components with routine software and without secondary data manipulation </plain></SENT>
