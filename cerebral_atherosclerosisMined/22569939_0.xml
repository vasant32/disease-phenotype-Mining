<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is worldwide one of the leading causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, surprisingly little is known about its prevalence and risk factors in a community-dwelling population of white descent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we determined the prevalence and investigated risk factors of intracranial internal carotid artery calcification (ICAC) as a marker of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To quantify the volume of ICAC, 2495 participants (mean age, 69.6 years) from the population-based Rotterdam Study underwent a nonenhanced computed tomography of the intracranial internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We calculated the prevalence of ICAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Next, we defined sex-specific quartiles and defined the upper quartile as severe ICAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Risk factors of ICAC were investigated by linear and logistic multivariate modeling and were stratified by sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall prevalence of ICAC was 82.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median volume of ICAC was 44 mm3 and was larger in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age was independently associated with ICAC in both men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In men, excessive alcohol intake and smoking (OR, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.28-2.37] and 1.72 [95% CI, 1.10-2.70]) were strong risk factors of ICAC, whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were in women (OR, 2.02 [95% CI, 1.29-3.17] and 1.79 [95% CI, 1.20-2.68]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A low <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density-lipoprotein</z:chebi> concentration was not associated with ICAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ICAC is highly prevalent and occurs in over 80% of older, white persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> are associated with ICAC, but risk factor profiles differ between men and women </plain></SENT>
