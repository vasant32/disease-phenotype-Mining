<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Short- and medium-term mortality after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is related to the severity of the index event and the patient's age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recent studies have reassessed the prognostic value of the systemic atherothrombotic burden in these patients, not only in the long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This post hoc analysis of the findings of the SIRIO trial (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> in Italy and Related Impact on Outcome) examined the prognostic impact of systemic atherothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SIRIO was a multicenter observational study enrolling patients during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of both ischemic and hemorrhagic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present analysis, however, only covered patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At baseline, the main personal and clinical details were recorded and patients were classified as having either polyvascular disease or single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> on the basis of whether they had symptomatic atherothrombotic disease in other sites besides the cerebrovascular location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients we calculated the Essen <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Risk Score (ESRS), dividing them into groups with scores of less than 3 or 3 and more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We recorded total mortality and nonfatal vascular events 12 months after enrolment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to select predictors of medium-term mortality and nonfatal cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 2,561 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, 823 of them classified as having polyvascular disease; 940 (out of 2,485) had an ESRS of less than 3 and 1,545 had a score of 3 or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The combined endpoint '<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes) and nonfatal cardiovascular events within 12 months of hospital discharge' was significantly dependent on the following factors: ESRS, Rankin scale and National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale scores, and polyvascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Polyvascular disease status significantly affected mortality and nonfatal cardio- and cerebrovascular events after discharge (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.10-1.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Age was also confirmed as a significant predictor of the combined endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Besides age and the clinical severity of the index event, symptomatic involvement of several vascular districts was also an important predictor of mortality and nonfatal cardiovascular events in the medium term in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
