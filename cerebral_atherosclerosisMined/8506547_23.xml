<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pathological data from autopsy studies are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The intracranial and extracranial arteries supplying the brains of 114 consecutive Chinese patients undergoing autopsy in a regional general hospital were examined by computer-assisted morphometric analysis under a microscope as well as by macroscopic grading for atherosclerotic narrowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The severity was correlated with various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>-related factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the intracranial cerebral vessels was more severe than that of the extracranial vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distal branches of the intracranial vessels were also commonly involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were identified as factors associated only with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.001), whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in both the intracranial (p &lt; 0.001) and extracranial (p = 0.012) vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Smoking was associated with narrowing of the extracranial vessels only (p = 0.0054) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with figures from Caucasian and Japanese populations, the extent of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is much more severe in Hong Kong Chinese, whereas atherosclerotic narrowing of the extracranial carotid artery is less severe in Hong Kong Chinese than in Caucasians </plain></SENT>
