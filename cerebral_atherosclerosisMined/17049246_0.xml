<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is known that the risk of recurrence is extremely high in patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> caused by intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we aimed to evaluate the clinical and radiological findings over a 6-month follow-up period in patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prospective data for the ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients admitted to our clinic between 2001 and 2004 were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The localization of stenosis/occlusion detected by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) was recorded and patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of one or more arterial stenoses on MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed up for 6 months at regular intervals and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 47 patients, 11 had posterior circulation stenosis and 36 had anterior circulation stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients had only one intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, whereas 14 had more than one intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 38 patients who completed the 6-month follow-up period, 13 had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and 10 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence in patients with intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> may be higher than in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to other aetiologies, and stenosis of multiple intracranial arteries increases the rate of recurrence </plain></SENT>
