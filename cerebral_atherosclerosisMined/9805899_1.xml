<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> in the posterior circulation is indicated for patients with atherosclerotic stenotic intracranial lesion or multiple stenotic lesions who have subnormal cerebral perfusion and low vasodilatory response to administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
