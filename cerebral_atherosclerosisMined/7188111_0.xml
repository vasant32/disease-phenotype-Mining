<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Measurements of cerebral blood flow (133Xe) show in the right hemisphere of the treated group a significant increase of fast perfused brain substance flow (Fg) in 7 out of the 10 cases and in the left hemisphere in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In none of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treated subjects a significant reduction of mean Fg was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the control group significant increase in 1 and significant reduction in another out of 20 hemispheres was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As for regional data, while significant elevation of Fg was observed in 36.7% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recorded areas (114 out of 311) after pentoxifylline, this occurred only in 6.4% in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of pentoxifylline on cerebral perfusion in the different areas was independent of their location but was more pronounced in hypoperfused tissue </plain></SENT>
