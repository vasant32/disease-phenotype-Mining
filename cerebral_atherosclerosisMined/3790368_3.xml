<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He was 115.8 cm tall and his weight 20 kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The characteristic manifestation of CS, i. e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo>, mental retardadation, cachectic feature, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001105'>retinal atrophy</z:hpo>, neural <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> and calcification of bilateral basal ganglia were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> noticed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It's controversial that early progress of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is due to ideopathic original feature of CS or to the secondary change from these complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
