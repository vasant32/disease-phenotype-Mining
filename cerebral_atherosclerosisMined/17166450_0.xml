<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify whether high level of plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> is an independent risk factor for potential cerebral large-artery atherosclerotic stenosis determined by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 276 adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> experienced DSA were selected, and 224 patients with potential large-artery atherosclerotic stenosis (grade &gt; 50%, not less than one of vascular) and 52 controls without stenosis or mild grade (grade &lt; or = 50%) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level was analyzed and conventional risk factors of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> such as sex and age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, long-smoking, long-alcohol and plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> was evaluated in 276 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportion of subjects with high level of plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (&gt; 15 micromol/L) was significantly higher in patients with potential atherosclerotic stenosis than those without (38.8% versus 15.4%; OR 3.49, 95% CI 1.57 - 7.77, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on multivariable stepwise logistic regression model, the odds ratio of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels was 4.10 (95% CI 1.80 - 9.32, P = 0.001) with additional adjustment for conventional risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> was more pronounced in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR = 4.89), old age (OR = 4.79) and low level of plasma <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (OR = 10.46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that high level of plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> is an independent risk factor for cerebral large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> is more pronounced in the presence of other risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
