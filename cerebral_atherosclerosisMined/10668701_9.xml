<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The effect of APOE on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> may be mediated through <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> and atherogenesis through its effect on cholesterol metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated this possibility among aged survivors from the UK Medical Research Council Trial of the Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> in Older Adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A total of 370 of 657 survivors from an initial cohort of 1,088 recruited into the trial between 1983 and 1985 were traced in 1994 and agreed to be screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were analyzed for APOE genotype and serum fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cholesterol level, smoking behavior, blood pressure, body mass index, and EKG recordings had been measured at recruitment 10 to 12 years earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) for the association between APOE epsilon4/* and both AD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were estimated and adjusted incrementally for the effect of age and premorbid intelligence, cholesterol, other risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, and EKG evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors diagnosed 24 cases of National Institute of Neurological and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009460" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Communicative Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> AD from 41 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The crude OR for the association between APOE epsilon4/* and AD was 3.40 (95% CI 1.30 to 8.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>APOE genotype was associated with serum cholesterol level, and there was a nonsignificant trend for an association with smoking behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for these and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other vascular risk factors and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> variables listed earlier, the OR for the association between APOE epsilon4/* and AD increased to 4.81 (1.60 to 14.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Presence of APOE epsilon4/* seems to increase the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and AD independently of its effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> and atherogenesis </plain></SENT>
