<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aims to determine the prevalence of AsIA and associated risk factors in the final study cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Crossover, population-based study of a representative sample (randomly selected from our reference population) older than 50 with a moderate-high vascular risk assessed by the vascular equation REGICOR and prior history of neither <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> nor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric, demographic, clinical data and blood samples were collected at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> individuals underwent a complete extracranial and transcranial color-coded duplex (TCCD) examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TCCD criteria were used to identify and classify the degree of intracranial stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 933 subjects (64% men, mean age 66.3 years) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One or more intracranial stenoses were detected at baseline in 80 subjects (8.6%) of whom 31 (3.3%) had moderate-severe lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The higher the REGICOR scores the greater the prevalence of AsIA (6.6%, 10.2% and 25% for REGICOR scores 5-9, 10-14 and â‰¥15, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (OR 2.95; 95% CI (1.68-5.18); p&lt;0.001), age (OR 1.05; 95% CI (1.02-1.08); p=0.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR 1.78; 95% CI (1.02-3.13); p=0.04) were independently associated with any degree of AsIA, while <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR 2.85; 95% CI (1.16-6.96); p=0.02) and age kept independently associated with moderate-severe AsIA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of AsIA and moderate-severe AsIA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free Caucasians with a moderate-high vascular risk were 8.6% and 3.3% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and age were independently associated with moderate-severe AsIA </plain></SENT>
