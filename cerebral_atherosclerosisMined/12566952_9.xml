<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with the clinical syndrome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> in the carotid territory or with ocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were retrospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were divided into an intracranial and an extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> group based on their vascular imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors were then compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 49 cases with extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and 51 with intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the patients with extracranial stenosis, 98% had associated intracranial disease, whereas none of those with intracranial stenosis had more than 50% of extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> were found to be significantly more prevalent among patients with extracranial internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> as well as a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> were found to be more significantly prevalent in patients with combined extracranial internal carotid artery and intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> might represent a more severe atherosclerotic process of the cervicocerebral circulation when compared with intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
