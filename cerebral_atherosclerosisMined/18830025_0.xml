<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty two patients aged 60-75 (26 male) have been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial neurological status, later deterioration and functional outcome were evaluated using Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS), National institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) and Barthel Index (BI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups: severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (GCS&lt;or=10, NIHSS &gt;15, BI&lt;16, n=25) and a moderate/mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (GCS&gt;10, NIHSS&lt;or=15, BI&gt;or=18, n=17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The NO concentration was detected by spectrophotometric and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytokine plasma levels were determined applying the Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical evaluation was performed by SPSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean values calculated using the t-paired test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pearson correlation ad multivariate logistic regression have been applied </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The NO plasma concentration within 48 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> more profoundly was reduced in aged patients, while in less severe cases and in relatively young patients it was significantly elevated (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The high plasma level of IL-6 in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> seems to be the strong predictor of poor outcome rather for aged, than for younger patients </plain></SENT>
