<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some patients with asymptomatic CAD might benefit from specific prevention, but the prevalence of asymptomatic CAD is not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the prevalence of &gt;or=50% asymptomatic CAD in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and whether the prevalence is related to traditional vascular risk factors and cervicocephalic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: From January 2006 to February 2009, consecutive patients between 45 and 75 years of age with nondisabling, noncardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and no prior history of CAD were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a 64-section computed tomography coronary angiography and a detailed cervicocephalic arterial workup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk factors were assessed individually and through the Framingham Risk Score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 300 patients included in the study, 274 had computed tomography coronary angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of &gt;or=50% asymptomatic CAD was 18% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14 to 23; n=50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic CAD was independently associated with traditional risk factors assessed individually and through the Framingham Risk Score (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; 95% CI, 1.0 to 7.6 for a 10-year risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> of 10% to 19%; and OR, 7.3; 95% CI, 2.8 to 19.1 for a 10 year-risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> &gt;or=20%), the presence of at least 1 &gt;or=50% cervicocephalic <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.4 to 11.2), excessive alcohol consumption (OR, 3.1; 95% CI 1.3 to 7.3), and ankle brachial index &lt;0.9 (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 0.9 to 5.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of &gt;or=50% asymptomatic CAD was also related to the extent of cervicocephalic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: About one fifth of patients with nondisabling, noncardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> have &gt;or=50% asymptomatic CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition to vascular risk factors, the presence of &gt;or=50% cervicocephalic <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> is strongly related to &gt;or=50% asymptomatic CAD </plain></SENT>
