<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of structural changes in the carotid arteries and heart and the correlation between these changes and the commonly recognized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Structural changes in the carotid arteries were defined as the intima-media thickness of the artery measured by B-mode ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes in the heart were defined as left ventricular mass index (LVMI) measured by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LVMI values greater than 134 g/m2 in men and greater than 110 g/m2 in women were considered abnormal, indicating the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure (BP) was measured in the clinic setting with a mercury sphygmomanometer and by 24-hour noninvasive ambulatory monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was defined as a sustained systolic BP greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP increase greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 225 subjects (107 women and 118 men) 48 to 64 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of intima-media thickening (intima-media thickness &gt; 1 mm) was 11% in normotensive subjects and 44% in hypertensive subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of plaque (wall thickening with either mineralization or focal protrusion in the lumen at least 50% greater than the surrounding wall, usually &gt; 2 mm) was observed in 35% of normotensive subjects and 44% of hypertensive subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> was 13% in normotensive subjects and 19% in hypertensive subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intima-media thickness in the common and bifurcation segments of carotid arteries correlated well with LVMI (r = .20 and r = .19, respectively; P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intima-media thickness and LVMI were both positively related to 24-hour monitored BP (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, in the multivariate analysis, body mass index (P = .027), sex (P &lt; .001), and 24-hour mean BP (P = .025) were the most significant determinants of LVMI, whereas carotid artery intima-media thickness was found to be associated best with age (P &lt; .001), cigarette smoking (P = .009), serum cholesterol (P = .025), serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P = .038), and nighttime systolic BP (P = .006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis confirmed the association between the presence of plaque and age (P &lt; .001), nighttime systolic BP (P &lt; .05), and cigarette smoking (P &lt; .05); a negative association between plaque and the decrease in mean systolic BP daytime to nighttime was also observed (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in a general population of unselected middle-aged subjects, carotid wall thickness and LVMI were associated with each other and related to 24-hour BP levels although the major determinants of carotid wall and cardiac structure were different </plain></SENT>
