<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: To describe vascular risk factors of patients harboring intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> (IAS) as well their final outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed clinical reports of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients admitted to our Institution from April 1, 1999 to November 30, 2001 with the diagnosis of IAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was made by means of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or four-vessels digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight patients harboring 56 IAS were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two control groups were selected: one was a group of 44 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and embolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopathy</z:e> (EC) and the other was a group of 67 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and extracranial stenosis without IAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age was 69.7 years, with male preponderance (76.3 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventeen cases (44.7 %) had associated extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> greater than 50 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple IAS were found in 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was significantly more frequent in the IAS group than in both control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, cigarette smoking was more common in the IAS group with respect to the EC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IAS was symptomatic in 25 cases, whereas in 13 patients IAS was found in the work-up for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in another territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>From the group of symptomatic patients, 22 (88 %) had a Rankin scale 2 or lower on discharge and, in the long term follow-up, their incidence rate of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was 15 per 100 patients/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was the most specific risk factor for IAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>IAS was multiple in 32% of patients and in extracranial stenosis from moderate to severe degree was found in 44.7% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> secondary to IAS caused a low dependency level at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Incidence rate of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was 15 % patients/ year </plain></SENT>
