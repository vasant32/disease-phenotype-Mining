<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have evaluated the relationship between carotid atherosclerotic change and periventricular hyper intensity (PVH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PVH was studied in 66 cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, comparing them with another group of age-matched controls, which consisted of 29 cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercholesteremia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI (fluid attenuated inversion recovery) and B-mode carotid ultrasonography of each lesion were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> lesions, compatible with neurological manifestation were divided into two types, cerebral cortical type (including centrum semiovale type) and small infarction in the deep subcortical type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PVH was classified into 4 grades, none, rims/caps, patchy and diffuse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Smooth PVH was, adjoining the anterior/posterior angles and the margins of the lateral ventricles, were defined as caps and rims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Irregular PVH areas, confluent with each other, were defined as patchy, while diffuse PVH areas extending below the cortex beyond the level of the corpus callosum were defined as diffuse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was evaluated using B-mode carotid ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The severity of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was assessed by using two indicators; incidence of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and maximum percentage diameter of the stenosis areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patchy and diffuse type PVH was frequent in the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On B-mode carotid ultrasonography, diffuse PVH was prominent in patients with stenotic change and high maximum percentage of stenosis, but none/rims/caps PVH was accompanied by variable B-mode carotid ultrasonographical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six patients had ulcerated plaques and they suffered more frequently with diffuse PVH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Diffuse PVH was more frequent in cases with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> than in other PVH types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that large vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> could result in diffuse PVH </plain></SENT>
