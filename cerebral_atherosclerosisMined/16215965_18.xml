<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To comparatively analyze two fast in vivo multislice black-blood carotid artery vessel wall imaging techniques with and without cardiac gating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight subjects with carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and four healthy subjects were studied using two black-blood multislice techniques: rapid extended coverage double inversion recovery (REX-DIR), and inflow/outflow saturation band (IOSB) rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) multislice acquisitions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantitative, qualitative, and morphometric analyses were performed on images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Gating produced significantly lower values for the REX-DIR sequence with respect to signal intensity in muscle and the carotid artery wall, whereas it had no effect on flow suppression compared to non-gated images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the IOSB sequences, gating had no significant effect on signal intensity of muscle and the carotid artery wall, but worsened flow suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>REX-DIR and IOSB sequences were statistically different with respect to signal intensity of muscle (with REX-DIR sequences having lower values), while no statistical significance was observed for flow suppression and wall delineation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A morphologic analysis of the vessel wall and lumen comparing REX-DIR gated, IOSB gated, REX-DIR non-gated, and IOSB non-gated sequences revealed no significant differences between the acquisition techniques tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Non-gated sequences may be used instead of gated sequences in atherosclerotic vessel wall imaging without compromising image quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This may shorten examination time and improve patient comfort </plain></SENT>
