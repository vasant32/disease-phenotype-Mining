<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the majority of cases of vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain diseases</z:e>, it is ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e>, which is the final and the most severe stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0007201'>cerebral arteries atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Etiopathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is not closer defined yet, but oxidative hypothesis is distinguished among the numerous theories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within this theory, main place is attached to oxidative modification of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and Lp(a), together with numerous physiopathologic facts with the central role of reactive oxidative matters, where <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> is the main disorder responsible for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of numerous impairments, such as changes in coagulation-anticoagulation system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Considering these facts, it was established the hypothesis that in patients with IBD existed changes in hemostatic system, which were in positive correlation with the degree of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study comprised 36 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> IBD and 28 patients with atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Control group was comprised of 30 patients with non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> of similar characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We investigated the correlation of the changes in hemostatic system (platelet aggregation, anti-thrombin III, D-dimer, protein C, factor VII, factor VIII, PAI-1) compared to the degree of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (ultrasonographically) and compared to the observed groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the basis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, the results of this study revealed significant increase of procoagulant factors concentration in patients with IBD, and similar changes were observed in patients with atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>, but less pronounced </plain></SENT>
