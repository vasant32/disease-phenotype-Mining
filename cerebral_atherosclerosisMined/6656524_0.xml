<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histological examination of the lower cerebellar arteries, obtained at autopsies of humans without cranial nerve dysfunction, was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of significant atherosclerotic changes of distant cerebellar arteries even in places predisposing to intimal thickening by haemodynamic reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The adventitia and arachnoidea contributed 30% to the vessel wall and may be the substrate of the reported local vessel thickening in neurovascular compression syndromes </plain></SENT>
