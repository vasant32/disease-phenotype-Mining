<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the number of pyramidal nerve cells within frontal and temporal cortex decreased significantly with age, measures of capillary density correlated only weakly with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stronger correlations, however, were noted between measures of capillary density and number of pyramidal cells, irrespective of age or disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Capillary measures did not differ in 6 of the mentally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients who showed a few plaques and tangles in their cortex from those of 6 other patients of similar age who did not show such changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the extent of the capillary network in the cerebral cortex alters to match the number and activity of functioning nerve cells; changes in quantity of capillary occurring with age or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> may, therefore, secondarily reflect a primary loss of nerve cells and do not form, per se, part of the degenerative process </plain></SENT>
