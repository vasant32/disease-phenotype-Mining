<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi>-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID) trial showed that patients with symptomatic 70% to 99% intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> are at particularly high risk of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on medical therapy: 18% at 1 year (95% CI = 3% to 24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Wingspan intracranial stent is another therapeutic option but there are limited data on the technical success of stenting and outcome of patients with 70% to 99% stenosis treated with a Wingspan stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen medical centers enrolled consecutive patients treated with a Wingspan stent in this registry between November 2005 and October 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on stenting indication, severity of stenosis, technical success (stent placement across the target lesion with &lt;50% residual stenosis), follow-up angiography, and outcome were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 129 patients with symptomatic 70% to 99% intracranial stenosis were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The technical success rate was 96.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean pre and post-stent stenoses were 82% and 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 30 days or ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> beyond 30 days was 14.0% at 6 months (95% CI = 8.7% to 22.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of &gt;or=50% restenosis on follow-up angiography was 13/52 (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of a Wingspan stent in patients with severe intracranial stenosis is relatively safe with high rate of technical success with moderately high rate of restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the event rates in high-risk patients in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi>-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID) vs this registry do not rule out either that stenting could be associated with a substantial relative risk reduction (e.g., 50%) or has no advantage compared with medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A randomized trial comparing stenting with medical therapy is needed </plain></SENT>
