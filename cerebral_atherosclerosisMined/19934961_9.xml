<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the short- and long-term rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-and/or-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> associated with primary angioplasty alone and angioplasty with stent placement using a meta-analysis of published studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both primary angioplasty alone and angioplasty with stent placement have been proposed as treatment strategies for symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease to reduce the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-and/or-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> with best medical treatment alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it remains unclear which of these endovascular techniques offers the best risk reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified pertinent studies published between January 1980 and May 2008 using a search on PubMed and Cochrane libraries, supplemented by a review of bibliographies of selected publications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-and/or-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were estimated for each report and pooled for both angioplasty alone and angioplasty with stent placement at 1 month and 1 year postintervention and then compared using a random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association of year of publication and 1-year incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-and/or-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was analyzed with meta-regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After applying our selection criteria, we included 69 studies (33 primary angioplasty-alone studies [1027 patients] and 36 studies of angioplasty with stent placement [1291 patients]) in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were a total of 91 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-and/or-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> reported in the angioplasty-alone-treated group (8.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.1%-10.6%), compared with 104 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-and/or-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the angioplasty-with-stent-treated group (8.1%; 95% CI, 6.6%-9.5%) during a 1-month period (relative risk [RR], 1.1; P = 0.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pooled incidence of 1-year <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-and/or-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients treated with angioplasty alone was 19.7% (95% CI, 16.6%-23.5%), compared with 14.2% (95% CI, 11.9%-16.9%) in the angioplasty-with-stent-treated patients (RR, 1.39; P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of technical success was 79.8% (95% CI, 74.7%-84.8%) in the angioplasty-alone group and 95% (95% CI, 93.4%-96.6%) in the angioplasty-with-stent-treated group (RR, 0.84; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pooled restenosis rate was 14.2% (95% CI, 11.8-16.6%) in the angioplasty-alone group, as compared with 11.1% (95% CI, 9.2%-13.0%) in the angioplasty-with-stent-treated group (RR, 1.28; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no effect of the publication year of the studies on the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-and/or-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Risk of 1-year <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-and/or-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and rate of angiographic restenosis may be lower in symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> patients treated by angioplasty with stent placement compared with patients treated by angioplasty alone </plain></SENT>
