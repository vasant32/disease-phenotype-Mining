<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was designed to investigate the anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> effects of this prescription, and to search its bioactive fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the anti-thrombotic effects by measuring platelet aggregation in rats, and the clotting time and protection rate in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The contents of total <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26605">saponins</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoids</z:chebi> in the bioactive fraction were determined by UV-vis spectrophotometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed that Naodesheng has significant anti-thrombotic and anticoagulation effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The contents of total <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26605">saponins</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoids</z:chebi> in the bioactive fraction were 7.885% and 8.434%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Such study will contribute to further exploration of Naodesheng in the therapy of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> diseases and to its re-development based on the bioactive fraction and ingredients </plain></SENT>
