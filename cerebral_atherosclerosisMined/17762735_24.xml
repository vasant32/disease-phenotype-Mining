<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Balloon-mounted coronary stents (BMCS) have been adapted for use in the intracranial circulation for the treatment of symptomatic intracranial atheromatous disease (ICAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective analysis of our 7-year experience with these devices in an attempt to quantify the periprocedural risks and long-term outcomes in patients with symptomatic ICAD of the vertebrobasilar (VB) system treated with BMCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database was performed to determine the neurological and non-neurological periprocedural risks of BMCS treatment of ICAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed with serial transcranial Doppler (TCD) and, in some cases, angiographic imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical status was determined based on clinic visits and by telephone interviews when possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over the 6-year period from March 1999 to May 2005, 44 patients (35 men, 9 women; average age, 64.8 yr) with 47 symptomatic atheromatous lesions of the VB system were treated with BMCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two patients, the BMSC could not be delivered across the target lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment of the remaining 45 lesions was technically successful (95.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The periprocedural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological morbidity</z:e> and mortality was 26.1% (10 clinically evident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One additional patient experienced a periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients died of non-neurological causes within 6 months (4.3%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001082'>cholecystitis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The average stenosis measured 82.5%, declining to 10.0% stenosis after BMCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>TCD examinations showed a preprocedural velocity of 127.7 cm/second (n = 43; standard deviation, 63.7 cm/s), which declined to 54.0 cm/s immediately after the procedure (n = 42; standard deviation, 22.7 cm/s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In patients with serial TCD evaluations, velocities were typically constant over years of follow-up (six patients with &gt;5 yr of follow-up; average velocity, 52.2 cm/s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Angiographic follow-up was available for 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Three patients had stent occlusion (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> symptomatic with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>), one patient had greater than 50% in-stent restenosis (ISR) (symptomatic with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) and seven had no significant (&lt;50%) stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The overall ISR/occlusion rate was 12.5% (4 out of 32 lesions with angiographic and/or TCD follow-up &gt; 6 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Of the 42 patients who successfully underwent BMCS, clinical follow-up was available for 33 (78.6%, average follow-up period, 43.5 mo), three patients died before any follow-up could be performed, and seven were lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with follow-up, five had recurrent vertebrobasilar ischemic symptoms (15%; four <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Four out of five patients with recurrent symptoms had ISR or occlusion verified on conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>At the time of the last follow-up examination, seven patients of 44 patients who underwent attempted treatment were dead (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score, 6); four had an mRS score of 3 to 5, 16 had an mRS score of 1 or 2, and 10 had an mRS score of 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting using BMCS for the treatment of symptomatic VB ICAD can be carried out with high rates of technical success and excellent immediate angiographic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, the procedure carries with it a very high rate of periprocedural morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Greater than 50% ISR or stent occlusion occurred in 12.5% of the patients and was associated with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In the absence of ISR/occlusion, patients who tolerated the initial procedure did well neurologically and did not typically experience recurrent ischemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
