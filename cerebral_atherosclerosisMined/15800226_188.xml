<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> is commonly used in preference to aspirin for this disorder, but these therapies have not been compared in a randomized trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> caused by angiographically verified 50 to 99 percent stenosis of a major intracranial artery to receive <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> (target international normalized ratio, 2.0 to 3.0) or aspirin (1300 mg per day) in a double-blind, multicenter clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from vascular causes other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 569 patients had undergone randomization, enrollment was stopped because of concerns about the safety of the patients who had been assigned to receive <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up period of 1.8 years, adverse events in the two groups included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (4.3 percent in the aspirin group vs. 9.7 percent in the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> group; hazard ratio for aspirin relative to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, 0.46; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.23 to 0.90; P=0.02), major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (3.2 percent vs. 8.3 percent, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.39; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.18 to 0.84; P=0.01), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> (2.9 percent vs. 7.3 percent, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.40; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.18 to 0.91; P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from vascular causes was 3.2 percent in the aspirin group and 5.9 percent in the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> group (P=0.16); the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from nonvascular causes was 1.1 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively (P=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary end point occurred in 22.1 percent of the patients in the aspirin group and 21.8 percent of those in the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> group (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.73 to 1.48; P=0.83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> was associated with significantly higher rates of adverse events and provided no benefit over aspirin in this trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aspirin should be used in preference to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> for patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
