<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the introduction of self-expanding stents (Wingspan Stent System) aroused considerable expectations in their employ for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a single-center experience of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting in a series of consecutive patients with intracranial stenoses and compare the safety and performance of balloon-mounted stents versus self-expanding stent systems (Wingspan) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients with 39 severe (&gt;70%) intracranial stenoses were treated during a 6-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An independent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> neurologist collected data about intra and periprocedural complications and short-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We considered as endpoint measures (1) any 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (2) any major 30-day complication and (3) procedure technical success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Technical success was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No vessel dissection or ruptures were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 17.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> in the territory of treated vessels and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhages</z:hpo> occurred respectively within 24 h and 5 days after endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three (17.6%) patients of Wingspan treated group and four (18.2%) of the patients treated with different stent systems had unfavorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our study confirms that endovascular treatment can be performed with a high technical success rate, even though the safety of these devices has still to be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
