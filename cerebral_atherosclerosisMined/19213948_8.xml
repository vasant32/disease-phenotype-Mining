<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to determine the safety of intracranial stenting with respect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients being treated with standardized antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of primary intracranial stenting of atherosclerotic stenoses and of stenting in coil embolization procedures in 67 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We focused on those cases that led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> even though the patients had been treated with standardized antiplatelet therapy before, during, and after stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient age ranged from 19 to 78 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 33 patients, stents were placed for treatment of atherosclerotic stenoses; in the remaining 34 patients, stents were placed to assist coiling of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients in this study were treated between January 2003 and August 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the total 67 patients initially treated successfully by intracranial stenting, 7 patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these 7 patients, 3 received stent placement into the basilar artery because of an underlying stenosis; in 1 patient, a stenosis of the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery was treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the anterior cerebral artery, the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, and the basilar artery were treated by stent-assisted coil embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 4 of the 7 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, recanalization of stents by local application of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator was successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial stenting can lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, even in patients who are treated with standardized antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Such complications have been described for patients after coronary artery stenting, but to our knowledge, no one has reported on a comparable number of cases of intracranial stenting procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In certain clinical scenarios, local thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator is an important treatment option to deal with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
