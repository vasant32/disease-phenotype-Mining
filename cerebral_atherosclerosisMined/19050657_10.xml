<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Primary stenting is a well-established treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and has been applied to symptomatic intracranial stenosis in selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study reports a large case series of middle cerebral artery revascularization using balloon-mounted coronary stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The series consisted of 113 consecutive patients with symptomatic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and more than 70% occlusion who underwent intracranial stenting at a single center from 2001 to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Technical success, periprocedural complications, recurrent symptoms, and restenosis were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for restenosis were analyzed using logistic regression and the chi(2) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 48 +/- 11 years (range, 25-79 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventy-three patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, and 40 patients were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The technical success rate was 96.46% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean stenosis was reduced from 80.83 +/- 8.77% to 3.71 +/- 8.15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 30 days was 4.42% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eighty-nine patients were followed for an average period of 29 +/- 16 months (range, 9 months-5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine vessels were followed with transcranial Doppler and 36 vessels with angiography or computed tomographic angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> occurred in 6 patients (6.74%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The restenosis rate was 20.25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Restenosis was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> but not with age, sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, or drug-eluting stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Primary stenting of symptomatic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> can be performed with high success and low complication rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Randomized clinical studies are warranted to compare the safety and efficacy of various endovascular revascularization techniques with maximal medical therapy in patients with symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
