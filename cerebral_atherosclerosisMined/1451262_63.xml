<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although vascular damage in the noncoronary circulation is a major cause of complications in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, relatively little is known of the in vivo geometry and function of the arterial circulation in patients with uncomplicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or of their relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo>, a marker of enhanced risk of cardiovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Wall thickness and internal diameter of the common carotid artery and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> within the extracranial carotid arteries were determined by ultrasound in 43 asymptomatic hypertensive patients and 43 normotensive subjects matched for sex, age, and body size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vascular stiffness was estimated from simultaneous superimposed carotid pressure waveforms obtained with an external solid-state transducer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular size and function were determined echocardiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, hypertensive patients had greater left ventricular absolute and relative wall thicknesses, left ventricular mass, and carotid absolute and relative wall thicknesses (p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carotid intimal-medial thickness exceeded the 95th percentile of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values in 28% of hypertensive patients (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was equally prevalent within the two blood pressure groups and was associated with older age, larger left ventricular and carotid wall thicknesses, and carotid diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite similar carotid pulse pressures, vascular stiffness was significantly increased in the hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the population as a whole, significant relations existed between cardiac and vascular wall thicknesses and internal dimensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, these relations were statistically independent of age and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study documents the presence of geometric and functional changes within the common carotid artery in uncomplicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> that parallel findings within the left ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The potential contribution of these changes to the cardiovascular complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, particularly in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo>, is unknown </plain></SENT>
