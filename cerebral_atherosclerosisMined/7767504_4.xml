<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Intima-media thickness has been reported to be increased in several patients with disorders such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No data are available for the less severe but more frequent forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to compare the intima-media thickness in men with mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> with that in age- and sex-matched normolipidemic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty hyperlipidemic patients and 50 controls were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intima-media thickness was evaluated from high-resolution B-mode echo-Doppler images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were measured using standard methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cigarette consumption was recorded by questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intima-media thickness was significantly higher in hyperlipidemic patients than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Smokers, both hyperlipidemic and controls, had higher values of intima-media thickness, although not significantly so, than non-smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The distribution of intima-media thickness values ranged from 0.52 to 1.24 mm in hyperlipidemic patients and from 0.46 to 0.82 mm in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> had an intima-media thickness larger than 0.82 mm and, of these, 14 had atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 11 hyperlipidemic patients showed signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and had significantly enlarged intima-media thickness compared with participants without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intima-media thickness in the common carotid artery is enlarged in patients with mild to moderate forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> and the highest values of intima-media thickness are frequently associated with atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid arteries and signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
