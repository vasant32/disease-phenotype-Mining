<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subtypes from the Trial of Org 10172 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Therapy (TOAST) classification, previously shown to be applicable to children, were retained in the proposed Paediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Classification (PSC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additional important paediatric AIS aetiologies were identified from a literature review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preliminary validation was performed by three raters who categorized clinical vignettes from 135 patients (66 male; median age 6.3 y, range 0.1 to 16 y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight aetiological subtypes were identified and defined, as follows: (1) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e>; (2) cardioembolic; (3) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e>; (4) cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo>; (5) steno-occlusive cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e>; (6) other determined aetiology; (7) multiple probable/possible aetiologies; and (8) undetermined aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was very good agreement between the raters about categorization of the vignettes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Causes of disagreement were identified and final categories and definitions were modified accordingly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the PSC enables the categorization of children with AIS into aetiological subtypes relevant to this age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This will be useful in multicentre studies of natural history and treatment but will require further independent validation </plain></SENT>
