<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transcranial Doppler (TCD) is often used as a screening tool for detecting intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since TCD results may vary among laboratories and sonographers, it requires validation against an imaging modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated diagnostic accuracy of TCD performed in our laboratory against time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in detecting intracranial stenosis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (&lt;24 hours) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> on MRA underwent both TCD and MRA within 5 hours of each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TCD was performed by credentialed neurosonologists according to standardized protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An independent neuroradiologist interpreting MRA was blinded to TCD findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We evaluated TCD peak systolic velocities (PSV) in proximal intracranial arteries as predictive of moderate (&gt;50%) and severe (&gt;70%) stenosis on TOF-MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and fifty patients (74% males; mean age 53 years) underwent neurovascular evaluation with TCD and MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two (14.6%) patients were excluded due to absent temporal acoustic windows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral artery TCD PSV values of &gt;140 cm/s and &gt;180 cm/s were found to predict a &gt;50% and &gt;70% focal stenosis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Optimal cut-off PSV values for other major proximal intracranial arteries were also established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TCD performed in our laboratory shows satisfactory agreement with TOF-MRA in diagnosis and grading of proximal intracranial stenosis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
