<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was found more frequently in patients with both OH and LV than in those with OH alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within the patients with OH alone, the drop in orthostatic blood pressure was greater in cases where progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with both OH and LV, the minimum orthostatic systolic blood pressure was lower in those with progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These facts show that the marked drop in orthostatic blood pressure may be related to cerebral ischemic lesions and that the combination of OH and LV may develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in older patients with transient orthostatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
