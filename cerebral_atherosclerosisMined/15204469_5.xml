<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To show the recovery process for different forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0150088" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">unilateral neglect</z:e> (UN)--including personal neglect and neglect of far space--in relationship to impairment, disability, cognition and mood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Patients were tested at 2-4 weeks, at 6 months and at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used the Behaviour <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0424101" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Inattention</z:e> Test and a test for personal neglect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also used the NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale, the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), the Mini-Mental State Evaluation and the Geriatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Peripersonal neglect diminishes within 6 months, but complete recovery occurred in only 13% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prognosis for personal neglect and neglect of far space is better, with a recovery ratio at 6 months of 52% and 46%, respective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The correlations between UN and FIM are high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A few patients deteriorate in the absence of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For clinical purposes, it is practical to postpone UN evaluation until a couple of weeks after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Many of the patients who then have UN are likely to retain their UN, although many will improve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with UN should receive special attention in the rehabilitation phase, as well as at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One explanation of the worsening of UN seen in some patients, may be continuing cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
