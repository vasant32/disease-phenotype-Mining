<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the relationship between the pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the anti-angiogenic endostatin, and the extent and risk of recurrence of symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of a total of 94 consecutive patients with symptomatic intracranial stenoses, 40 fulfilled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracranial stenoses were confirmed by magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion-weighted sequences was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasmatic VEGF and endostatin were determined from blood samples obtained 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and patients were followed-up thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 144 intracranial stenoses were confirmed (median number per patient=3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endostatin/VEGF ratio gradually augmented with the increasing number of intracranial stenoses (r=0.35, P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (OR, 6.04; CI, 1.1 to 32.2; P=0.03) and a higher endostatin/VEGF ratio (OR, 15.7; CI, 2.2 to 112.3; P=0.006) were independently associated with a greater extent of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 13 months, 8 patients (20%) experienced a new cerebral ischemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A higher baseline endostatin concentration was an independent predictor of new events (hazard ratio, 7.24; CI, 1.6 to 33.8; P=0.011) in a Cox regression model after adjustment for age, sex, number of stenotic vessels, and risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with a higher endostatin level had a lower survival free of new events (P=0.01, log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A predominance of the inhibitor endostatin within the endogenous angiogenic response is associated with a greater extent and risk of recurrence of symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, suggesting that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> may be beneficial in this condition </plain></SENT>
