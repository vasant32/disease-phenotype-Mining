<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The character of <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp>, the meaning of the terms "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intimas" "fatty streaks", "fibrous plaques" and "complicated lesions", the type of the early <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp>, the age period of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of these early lesions, their sequence of development, their relationship to advanced lesions--<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> appeared method dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The gross inspection alone led not only to an oversimplified, but also to a distorded view on the natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, since it overlooked the role of intimal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, incorporated microthrombi, fibromuscular plaques, mucoid plaques and foam cell-rich plaques in atherogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The degree and extent to which the early stages of atherosclerotic involvement remained undetected by gross inspection was surprisingly great </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference between the number of atherosclerotic plaques recorded on microscopic and macroscopic examination of the same vascular segments was statistically significant (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> basic studies of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> must include intermingled macroscopic and microscopic examination of the same arterial segments and require the use of an adequate terminology </plain></SENT>
