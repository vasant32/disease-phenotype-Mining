<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> from large-vessel atherosclerotic occlusions or severe stenoses are often resistant to re-canalization with thrombolytic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes, angioplasty and stenting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may be used to achieve timely reperfusion with possibly less risk for hemorrhagic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From a prospectively collected database, we have retrospectively reviewed cases of patients presenting acutely with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or subacutely with fluctuating ischemic deficits due to a large-vessel atherosclerotic stenosis and who were treated with angioplasty and stenting without thrombolytics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endpoints were reperfusion based on the Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> (TIMI) score, procedural complications, parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> formation leading to neurologic decline, and 30-day clinical improvement based on the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> scale (NIHSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine patients with a mean age of 70 +/- 9 years and mean NIHSS of 18.3 +/- 5.0 were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Culprit stenotic lesions were located in the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) origin (2), intracranial ICA (2), tandem stenosis in the extra- and intracranial ICA (3), and middle cerebral artery (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients were treated with angioplasty and adjunctive stenting; one of these patients also required snaring of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> from the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient was treated with angioplasty of an intracranial ICA stenosis alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TIMI 3 reperfusion was achieved in 8 (88.9%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean 30-day improvement in the NIHSS was 15.5 +/- 5.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six patients had a NIHSS of 0 or 1 at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient died due to reasons unrelated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or interventional procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no significant complications or parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In appropriately selected patients with ischemic deficits due to large artery atherosclerotic stenoses, angioplasty with adjunctive stenting can be safely performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Such interventions may improve outcome without the use of thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
