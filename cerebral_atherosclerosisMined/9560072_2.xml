<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of charts from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Hispanics seen during January 1996 through July 1997 at an academic hospital-based geriatrics practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: An academic, hospital-based, primary care geriatrics practice staffed by fellows in a geriatrics training program and by full-time faculty geriatricians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: One hundred sixty women and 53 men, mean age 80 +/- 8 years (range 64 to 100), were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 213 Hispanics in the study, 59 (28%) had documented CAD, 43 (20%) had ABI, 34 (16%) had PAD, and 90 (42%) had either CAD, ABI, or PAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were measured in 202 of 213 subjects (95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> was measured in 137 of 213 patients (64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other risk factor data were documented in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis performed in 202 patients using the variables age, gender, cigarette smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, serum total cholesterol, and serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> showed statistically significant associations between prevalent CAD, ABI, or PAD and age (P = .002, odds ratio (OR) = 1.083), cigarette smoking (P = .002, (OR) = 3.865), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (P = .007, (OR) = 2.749), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (P = .028, (OR) = 2.386), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (P = .014, (OR) = 2.608), serum total cholesterol (P &lt; 0.001, (OR) = 1.025), and serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (P = .017, (OR) = .993) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Either CAD, ABI, or PAD was present in 42% of 213 older Hispanics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were statistically significant associations between prevalent CAD, ABI, or PAD in older Hispanics and risk factors, including age, cigarette smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and serum total cholesterol </plain></SENT>
