<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At stage I discirculatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> subjective complaints predominated, being caused by syndrome of thoracic outlet, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0349422" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">steal syndrome</z:e>, stenosing lesions of brachiocephalic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Encountered more frequently in the middle-aged and elderly patients were affections of several major brain arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specific weight of correlation between ultrasonic investigation and angiography in stenosing lesions of brachiocephalic arteries in patients with discirculatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> constituted 84-100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore patients with discirculatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> of atherosclerotic genesis require ultrasonic investigation of brachiocephalic arteries with the purpose of finding out exactly the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> and choosing the tactics of treatment </plain></SENT>
