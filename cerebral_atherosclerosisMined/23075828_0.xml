<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: Population-based studies have estimated that about 15% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> are caused by large-vessel cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the types of large-vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> in a population-based <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: Patients with first-ever or recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the Greater Cincinnati area were identified during 2005 at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> local hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Study physicians assigned <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall event rates and incidence rates for first-ever events were calculated, and age-, race- and sex-adjusted to the 2000 US population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: There were 2,204 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo>, including 365 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> of large-vessel subtype (16.6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis was associated with 8.0% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo>, while extracranial ICA occlusion and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were each associated with 3.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The annual rate of first-ever and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> attributed to extracranial ICA was 13.4 (11.4-15.4) per 100,000 persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conservatively estimate that about 41,000 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> may be attributed to extracranial ICA stenosis annually in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Large-vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is an important cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, with extracranial ICA stenosis being significantly more common than extracranial ICA occlusion or intracranial atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
