<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Men were examined in 1989 as a part of the 30-year follow-up examination of the eastern Finnish cohort of the Seven Countries Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean maximal intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) of the right and left common carotid arteries was 1.5 mm (range, 0.7 to 5.3 mm; standard deviation, 0.7 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one percent of the subjects had nonmineralized atheroma and 91% had single or multiple mineralizations in any of the arterial segments imaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both mean maximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and nonmineralized atheromas were associated significantly (P &lt; .05) with the presence of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0919993" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid murmur</z:e>, at least one nonpalpable peripheral arterial pulse, ischemic resting electrocardiographic abnormalities, and history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> but not with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004417'>intermittent claudication</z:hpo> at the 30-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant associations were found between carotid mineralizations and clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Long-term elevations of serum cholesterol and long-term smoking, measured as the number of risk factor elevations in the six examinations, were associated with the presence of nonmineralized atheroma in the elderly (in 1989) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Smoking and repeatedly detected <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, on the other hand, had an association with the presence of mineralizations in 1989 </plain></SENT>
