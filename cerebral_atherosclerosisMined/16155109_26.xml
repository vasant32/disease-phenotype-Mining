<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It was hypothesized that endothelial glycocalyx perturbation contributes to increased vulnerability of the arterial wall exposed to atherogenic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Glycocalyx and intima-to-media ratios (IMR) were studied at a low- and a high-risk region within the murine carotid artery (common region) and internal carotid branch (sinus region) in control C57BL/6J (C57BL6) and age-matched C57BL/6J/apoE*3-Leiden (apoE*3; on an atherogenic diet) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electron micrographs revealed significantly thinner glycocalyces [73 (SD 36) vs. 399 (SD 174) nm, P &lt; 0.05] and greater IMR [0.096 (SD 0.045) vs. 0.044 (SD 0.023), P &lt; 0.05] at the sinus region of C57BL6 mice than in the common region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thinner glycocalyces [100 (SD 27) vs. 399 (SD 174) nm, P &lt; 0.05] and greater IMR [0.071 (SD 0.024) vs. 0.044 (SD 0.023), P &lt; 0.05] were also observed in the common region of age-matched apoE*3 mice on an atherogenic diet for 6 wk vs. C57BL6 mice on a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Greater IMR were due to greater intima layers, without significant changes in media layer dimension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, atherogenic diet resulted in increased endothelial cell thickness at the sinus region [0.85 (SD 0.49) vs. 0.53 (SD 0.28) microm, P &lt; 0.05] but not at the common region [0.66 (SD 0.37) vs. 0.62 (SD 0.32) microm] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that both regional and diet-induced increases in atherogenic risk are associated with smaller glycocalyx dimensions and greater IMR and that vascular sites with diminished glycocalyx are more vulnerable to proinflammatory and atherosclerotic sequelae </plain></SENT>
