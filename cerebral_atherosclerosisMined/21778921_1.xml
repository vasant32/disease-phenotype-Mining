<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and deployment of a self-expanding stent is a safe treatment for intracranial atherosclerotic stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The significant recurrence rate might be related to the high radial force of the Wingspan stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the procedural safety and stenosis recurrence rate by the use of a stent with reduced radial force (Enterprise) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred nine atherosclerotic stenoses (189 patients) were treated (median age, 68 years; 132 male) in a single center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesion locations included internal carotid artery (n = 27), middle cerebral artery (n = 62), vertebral artery (n = 64), basilar artery (n = 55), and posterior cerebral artery (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postmedication included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">Clopidogrel</z:chebi> for at least 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preprocedural and follow-up examinations included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), neurological assessment, and digital subtraction angiography (6, 12, 26, and 52 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data registry included age, sex, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vessel diameter, degree of stenosis, residual stenosis after stent, minimal in-stent diameter, and occurrence of ischemic symptoms during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median pre- and postprocedural stenosis rate was 65.4 ± 1% vs 25.1 ± 1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Technical success rate was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Major procedural complications occurred in 16 patients (8.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Combined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological morbidity</z:e> and mortality rate at 30 days was 2 patients (0.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 174 stenoses (83%) angiographic follow-up was obtained (mean, 10.2 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A restenosis (&gt;50%) was observed in 43 (24.7%) cases after 4.2 months (mean) with 4 (9.3%) symptomatic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Incidence of recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> related to the stented artery was 2.2% during 10.2 months of mean follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Undersized balloon angioplasty and deployment of an Enterprise stent is safe and effective for intracranial stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Follow-up results were equal to or better than those reported for bare-metal balloon-expandable or self-expanding stents and yielded excellent protection from recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
