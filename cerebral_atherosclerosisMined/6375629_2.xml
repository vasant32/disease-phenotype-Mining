<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We prospectively compared duplex ultrasonography with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and conventional angiography in the evaluation of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> by studying 494 arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arteries were graded independently as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, mildly stenotic, moderately stenotic, severely stenotic, or occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was absolute agreement between duplex ultrasonography and DSA as to disease severity in 296 (68%) of 434 vessels, good correlation in an additional 119 vessels (28%), and poor correlation in 19 vessels (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When duplex studies were compared with conventional angiograms, the correlations were similar: absolute for 60 (71%) of 85 vessels, good for 17 (20%) of 85 vessels, and poor for eight (9%) of 85 vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With conventional angiography as the standard, duplex studies tended to overestimate the severity of disease in 64% of vessels and underestimate it in 36%, v 28% and 72%, respectively, for DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We concluded that duplex ultrasonography is as accurate as DSA in assessing carotid bifurcation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The tendency of DSA to underestimate disease severity may lead to diagnostic errors in patients with nonobstructive plaques </plain></SENT>
