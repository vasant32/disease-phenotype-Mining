<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven patients, who were diagnosed as suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> based on clinical and pathological criteria, were classified into two groups based on the white matter lesions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger</z:e>'s type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Namely, group 1 consisted of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> patients without any subcortical or white matter lesions (30 cases); group 2 consisted of those with white matter lesions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger</z:e>'s type (11 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other 9 cases included those with vascular lesions and 4 with some of the same pathological changes found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinically, group 2 patients showed subcortical symptoms such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo>, Parkinsonian gait, being accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Periventricular lucency (CT) were common in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Macroscopically, both groups showed moderately to severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, and the width of the corpus callosum of group 2 was narrower than that of group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In microscopic findings, patients in group 2 showed diffuse distribution of cortical changes such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>senile plaques</z:hpo> as well as Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>senile plaques</z:hpo> as well as Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> while those in group 1 showed various types of diffuse or local distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878486" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Arteriolosclerosis</z:e> of the white matter were found in both groups </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The complication of white matter lesions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger</z:e>'s type was not a rare finding in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SDAT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
