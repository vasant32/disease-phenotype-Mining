<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of carotid plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and severity of stenosis on symptoms of cerebrovascular disease and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and ninety patients with 329 carotid plaques producing 50-99% stenosis were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Carotid plaque echogenicity on ultrasonography was evaluated using computerised measurement of the median of the overall grey scale content (GSM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> was evaluated as the difference between the GSMs of the most echogenic and the most echolucent areas within each plaque and expressed as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> index (HI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a CT brain scan and the presence of ipsilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> was more common in symptomatic than asymptomatic plaques (42% vs. 29%, p&lt;0.02) and in echolucent than echogenic plaques (mean GSM of 37.8 vs. 29.7, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plaques with GSM below or equal to 32 were associated with a higher incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> as compared to those above this level, this was significant in both symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic carotid plaque were less heterogenous than asymptomatic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plaques associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> were less heterogenous than those not associated with infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study has shown that the identification of the high risk carotid plaques, i.e. those associated with a high incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> is possible both in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The potential of such analysis in the identification of patients with asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> with high and low risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> should be explored in a natural history study </plain></SENT>
