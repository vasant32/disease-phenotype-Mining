<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirteen plaques were from asymptomatic patients, 15 were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo>, 10 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> and 14 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal images of the anterior and posterior component of each plaque were obtained by ATL Ultramark-4 Duplex scanner and were transferred to a computer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using an image analysis program the median of the overall grey scale content of each plaque component was evaluated and used as a measure of echogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following carotid endarterectomy each plaque specimen was divided into anterior and posterior component and then fixed, oriented, sectioned and stained in the longitudinal plane corresponding to the ultrasound image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plaque histology sections were then examined by computer morphometric analysis and the percentage surface areas of fibrous tissue, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> deposits and haemorrhage were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was then correlated with the grey scale median for each plaque component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plaques with a high <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and haemorrhage content as established histologically had a low grey scale median (Spearman correlation r=-0.351, p&lt;0.05) and those with a high fibrous content had a high grey scale median (r=0.411, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study has shown that computerised measurement of carotid plaque echogenicity correlates well with histology and could be used to predict plaque composition, thus identifying high risk plaques with high <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and haemorrhage content </plain></SENT>
