<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study was carried out to determine whether a relationship exists between cutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> after superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery anastomosis and background risk factors or surgical methods, and to determine whether such <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> is predictable or avoidable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-seven patients (a total of 51 sides) with <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> of the internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery who underwent superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery anastomosis at the National Kyushu Medical Center Hospital between September 1, 1994, and August 31, 1999, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each procedure was analyzed to determine whether cutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was present postoperatively around the donor site, whether preexisting risk factors (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> obliterans) were present, and whether a flap or cutdown method or a single or double anastomosis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was clearly related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> obliterans (P &lt; 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The tendency for a relationship between <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and smoking was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although statistical analysis failed to demonstrate a significant difference, <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was found with the flap method but not with the cutdown method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Further study is needed using greater numbers to clarify the relationship between the surgical method and the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To prevent cutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, however, it may be preferable to use the cutdown method in patients with the preexisting risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> obliterans or in smokers </plain></SENT>
