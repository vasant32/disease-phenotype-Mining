<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aluminium concentration for 7 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human brains was 1-9 +/- 0-7 SD mug/g dry weight (n = 208 samples) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aluminium content of 585 areas sampled in 10 post-mortem cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> ranging in age from 50 to 88 years, in which the diagnosis was based on the specific histological appearances, revealed an elevated aluminium content in some regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A range of 0-4 - 107-0 mug/g was encountered and 28 per cent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions sampled had concentrations in excess of 4 mug/g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five of 6 cerebral biopsies from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> also had elevated aluminium content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 2 additional Alzheimer's brains with neurofibrillary degeneration restricted to certain anatomical areas, elevated aluminium content was found to be associated with neurofibrillary degeneration and not with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>senile plaques</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, elevated aluminium content in multiple cortical regions was not found in 2 vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> of the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While the cytotoxic concentration for human neurons is unknown, the cytotoxic concentration for cat's cerebral neurons appears to lie between 4 and 6 mug/g dry weight </plain></SENT>
