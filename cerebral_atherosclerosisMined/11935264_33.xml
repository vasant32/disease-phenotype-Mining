<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess whether the patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and lacunes have fewer plaques and tangles than those without vascular lesions, for similar severity of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a prospective clinicopathological study in elderly patients of a long-stay care unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The severity of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was assessed by psychometry performed according to standardized methods less than 6 months before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A volumetric study of cerebral vascular lesions was performed at post-mortem study of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The density of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo> (SP), Amyloid beta focal deposits (A beta <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e>), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> (NFT) in the temporal and frontal isocortex was quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> III criteria, 28 of the 33 patients for whom autopsies were performed had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four of the included patients had degenerative or vascular lesions, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The volume of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and lacunes was significantly correlated with the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The density of SP, A beta <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> and NFT in the temporal and frontal isocortex was significantly lower when vascular lesions were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For similar clinical severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, there were fewer AD lesions in patients with vascular lesions than in those without vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
