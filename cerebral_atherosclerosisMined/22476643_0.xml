<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this paper is to explore whether the heterozygosity at the 9 CODIS short tandem repeats (STR) loci including D3S1358, vWA, FGA, D8S1179, D21S11, D18S51, D5S818, D13S317 and D7S820 is associated with the risk of atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The DNA samples were collected from patients with CI (n = 72) and people over the age of 90 years without CI (n = 59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alleles of the STR loci were determined using the STR Profiler Plus PCR amplification kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> and heterozygosity was determined with the Cox regression method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A correlation between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> and heterozygosity was observed for the D8S1179 locus (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It implied that regions in the vicinity of locus D8S1179 may harbor susceptibility genes for CI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The analysis of heterozygosity for particular loci as genetic markers using our new study design may be an efficient and reliable approach to estimate genetic predispositions </plain></SENT>
