<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Some <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients will deteriorate following improvement (DFI), but the cause of such fluctuation is often unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While resolution of neurological deficits is usually related to spontaneous recanalization or restoration of collateral flow, vascular imaging in patients with DFI has not been well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively studied patients who presented with a focal neurological deficit that resolved spontaneously within 6 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated with bedside transcranial Doppler (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiography (DSA), computed tomographic angiography (CTA), or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) were performed when feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DFI was defined as subsequent worsening of the neurological deficit by &gt;/=4 National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale points within 24 hours of the initial symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We studied 50 consecutive patients presenting at 165+/-96 minutes from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 61+/-14 years; 50% were females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had TCD at the time of presentation, and 68% had subsequent angiographic examinations (DSA 10%, CTA 4%, and MRA 44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, large-vessel occlusion on TCD was found in 16% of patients (n=8); stenosis was found in 18% (n=9); 54% (n=27) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> studies; and 6 patients (12%) had no temporal windows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DFI occurred in 16% (n=8) of the 50 patients: in 62% of patients with TCD and angiographic evidence of occlusion, in 22% with stenosis, and in 4% with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vascular studies (P&lt;0.001, Phi=0.523, chi(2)=12.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DFI occurred in 31% of patients with large-vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, 23% with cardioembolism, and 9% with small-vessel disease when <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms were determined within 2 to 3 days after admission (P=0.2, NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DFI is strongly associated with the presence of large-vessel occlusion or stenosis of either atherosclerotic or embolic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> vascular studies and lacunar events were associated with stable spontaneous resolution without subsequent fluctuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Urgent vascular evaluation may help identify patients with resolving deficits and vascular lesions who may be candidates for new therapies to prevent subsequent deterioration </plain></SENT>
