<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of Apo A1 and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> remain close in both groups, respectively to 1,6 +/- 0,33 mmol/l and 0,85 +/- 0,18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in the patients group, the concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and cholesterol are very increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients less than 60 years old; beyond they meet the ones of the control subjects with same age; the concentrations of the Apo B stay high in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the predictive value of the concentrations of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> and of the Apo A1 remains very uncertain; it's much lower than the value of the concentrations of Apo B, major protein constituent of the atherogenic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> which are increased significantly whatever may be the age of the patient who show <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vascular accident linked to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
