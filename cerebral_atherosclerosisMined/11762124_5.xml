<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The majority of the studies investigating risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have focused on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of extracranial carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for the involvement of intracranial arteries in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have not been widely investigated so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pulsatility index reflects the vascular resistance of intracranial arteries and could therefore be used as an estimate of the severity of vascular damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN PURPOSE: The present study aimed to examine the influence of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and some other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> risk factors on intracranial vascular resistance in patients with a previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transcranial doppler investigations were performed in 103 patients with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (31 with diagnosis of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 72 without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>), at least 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood flow velocities of anterior cerebral arteries, middle cerebral arteries, the intracranial part of vertebral arteries and the basilar artery, as well as of the extracranial part of the internal carotid artery were measured, and Gosling's pulsatility index was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The maximal pulsatility index of intracranial arteries was defined to express the most pronounced damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diabetic patients had a significantly higher pulsatility index than non-diabetic patients in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> examined intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The maximal pulsatility index was also significantly higher in diabetic patients than in non-diabetic patients (1.24 +/- 0.25 vs. 1.00 +/- 0.23; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the pulsatility index between men and women and between groups of patients with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p &lt; 0.0001) and the age of patients (p &lt; 0.0001) were the only factors significantly predicting maximal pulsatility index, and this relationship was independent on the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic patients with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have a higher pulsatility index than non-diabetic patients with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, which indicates a higher increase in intracranial arterial resistance and more severe damage to cerebral blood flow in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
