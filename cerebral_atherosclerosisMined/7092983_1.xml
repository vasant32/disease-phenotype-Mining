<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a population sample aged 1-70 years where the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was violent accident, the prevalence of intimal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> varied between 31.5 and 95.1% of cases in the basilar artery and between 10.5 and 59.6% of cases in the anterior cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both basilar and anterior cerebral arteries the first areas of intimal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> occurred one or two decades earlier than the first fibromuscular plaques and the first fatty streaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In each age group investigated the percentage of subjects with intimal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> appearing as an independent lesion was consistently greater than the percentage of subjects with atherosclerotic plaques, fatty streaks or incorporated microthrombi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Successive observations of similar topographic points placed in sequence according to age showed that many areas of intimal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> may represent the first stage in the development of atheromas or fibronecrotic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, using the same material and method, we were unable to reveal in intracranial arteries of subjects aged 31-70 years the conversion of fatty streaks to fibrous plaques </plain></SENT>
