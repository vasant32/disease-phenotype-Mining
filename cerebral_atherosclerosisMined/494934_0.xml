<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found that the artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> was often combined with a lateral shift of the artery opening, convolute shape of the major brain vessels, and functional reconstruction of the Villisian circle, a transitional type of the posterior trifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was ascertained that the vertebral artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath>, not being a pathogenetic factor itself, can play a negative role in cases of occlusion of a major brain vessel, since it limits the potentialities of compensatory blood circulation </plain></SENT>
