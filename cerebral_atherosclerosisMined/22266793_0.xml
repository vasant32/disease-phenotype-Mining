<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The gold standard for the diagnosis of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> remains catheter based digital subtraction angiography (DSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A symptomatic hemodynamically non-significant intracranial atherosclerotic lesion is described, whose underlying embologenic characteristics were not detectable by either DSA or three-dimensional rotational angiography (3DRA) but fully realized by C-arm cone beam CT (CBCT) angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old man presented with crescendo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> consisting of right arm tingling and hand <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> despite long term dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> for coronary artery stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DSA and 3DRA demonstrated a smooth benign appearing left cavernous internal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> of &lt;50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Given the incongruence of the lesion with the patient's symptoms and lack of response to aggressive medical treatment, a decision was made to obtain higher resolution imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CBCT angiography was obtained with injection at two contrast dilutions, which uncovered an underlying ruptured ulcerated calcific plaque with a small dissective component and overlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lesion was treated with anticoagulation followed by balloon mounted stent angioplasty, with symptom resolution and maintained patency at the 1 year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The superior spatial resolution and dynamic range characteristics of CBCT angiography provide added clinical utility in disambiguation of questionable intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> which may be missed by conventional planar and rotational angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The additional information provided by CBCT angiography could be useful in lesion risk stratification and help refine indications for intracranial stent angioplasty given its recent documented shortcomings vis a vis medical management </plain></SENT>
