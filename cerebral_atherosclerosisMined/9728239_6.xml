<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Most of the major extracranial arteries have vasa vasorum which play an important role in some pathological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in the intracranial arteries, the existence of vasa vasorum and their pathological implication have not been adequately investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the distribution and incidence of vasa vasorum in the major cerebral arteries and their relationships to certain clinical factors in 50 autopsy cases performed between 1987 and 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By light microscopy, vasa vasorum were found in 36 of 50 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 36 patients, vasa vasorum in 30 cases were localizedly observed in the tunica adventitia and the in other 6 were distributed in the tunica media accompanied by intramural haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Existence of vasa vasorum was more common in the proximal arteries (vertebral, internal carotid, and basilar arteries) than in the distal arteries (middle cerebral and anterior cerebral arteries) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vasa vasorum were found more frequently in aged patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and those with cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that intracranial vasa vasorum existed with a higher frequency in the tunica adventitia of the vertebral and internal cerebral arteries, and the incidence of vasa vasorum related to severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The development of vasa vasorum in the tunica media may reflect some pathological changes of cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
