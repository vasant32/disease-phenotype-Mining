<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present case-control study we investigated the association of -7351C/T polymorphism (rs2020918) and I/D polymorphism of tPA gene and Insertion/deletion polymorphism (4G/5G) of PAI-1 gene with genetic predisposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>516 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and 513, sex and age matched healthy controls were involved in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We did not find a significant association of tPA -7351C/T polymorphism and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in case of I/D polymorphism significant difference was observed in the genotypic distribution and allelic frequency between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DD genotype and D allele associated significantly with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p=0.002 and &lt;0.001 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also found significant association of I/D polymorphism with intracranial large artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of undetermined etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exploring the association between gene-gene interaction (26 combinations including the three variants) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we found that individuals with CC+4G4G+DD, CC+5G5G+ID, CT+4G5G+ID, CT+5G5G+II, CT+5G5G+ID and TT+4G5G+II had a significantly higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest that -7351C/T polymorphism of tPA and 4G/5G polymorphism of PAI-1 are not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, while as DD genotype and D allele of tPA gene are important risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further we found that the subjects with different tPA and PAI genotype combinations displayed a significantly high risk for overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> suggesting that gene-gene interaction involving more variants may change the susceptibility of particular subjects to the disease </plain></SENT>
