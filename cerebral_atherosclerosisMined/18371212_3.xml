<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In Spain, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is one of the major causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and the main cause of severe disability in people over 65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes, case fatality and disability at 90 days after the event in a Spanish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective community-based register of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> was established in Santa Coloma de Gramenet (Barcelona) [116,220 inhabitants of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages, according to the municipal census of December 31,2001], from January 1 to December 31, 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standard definitions and case finding methods were used to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Every patient underwent a complete clinical evaluation and systematic tests including neuroimaging (CT/MRI) and vascular studies (carotid duplex ultrasound intra and extracranial and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over a one year period, 196 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> were registered [107 men; median age = 76 years (range 39-98)], being the first event in 159 patients (81.1%) and a recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 37 (18.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After age-adjustment to the European population, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> per 100,000 inhabitants was 172 (95% CI, 148-196); 219 (176-261) in men and 133 (105-160) in women, with an annual incidence for first <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> of 139 (118-161); 165 (128-201) in men and 115 (89-140) in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> subtypes (TOAST classification criteria) were lacunar in 28.8%, atherothrombotic in 18.6%, cardioembolic in 26.6% and undetermined in 26.0% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 90 days, the case-fatality was 12%, and among survivors, moderate-to-severe disability was present in 45 % at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This prospective community-based study shows one of the lowest incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Europe, as well as one of the lowest case fatality and disability rates at 90 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
