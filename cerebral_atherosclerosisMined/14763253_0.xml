<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine patients with VE of stages I and II, aged 45-73 years, without current <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (in exacerbation stage) other somatic diseases have been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results revealed that a different extent of diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lesion of brain</z:e> tissue was accompanied by an own pattern of thyroid homeostasis: 1) significantly higher TTH levels with intact regulatory negative feedback "fT3-TTH" in patients with VE, stage 1; 2) significant TTH concentration decrease, with pronounced suppression of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30660">thyroxine</z:chebi> conversion to triiodothyronine and interaction disturbance in the "fT3--pituitary gland" system, in patients with VE in stage II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A distinct trend towards plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> level increase as well as significantly lower active plasma renin levels were found in the patients with VE in stage II comparing to those in stage I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correlation analysis demonstrated the absence of an interaction between patient's age and hormonal homeostasis state and an extent of <z:mp ids='MP_0005412'>vascular stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data suggest involvement of the hormones of hypothalamopituitary-adrenal, thyroid and renin-angiotensin systems in VE formation thus enabling using of the results of their testing as an additional criterion for estimation of brain diffusive lesion severity </plain></SENT>
