<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Actual blood pressure value and diurnal fluctuation in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage were also related to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and outcome </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the daily highest and lowest mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) between the two groups (124.8 +/- 11.8 mmHg vs. 118.5 +/- 13.5 mmHg and 101.9 +/- 10.4 mmHg vs. 104.4 +/- 12.6 mmHg, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, apparent circadian fluctuation of the MABP (the highest MABP--the lowest MABP &gt; 25 mmHg) was more frequently seen in the treated group (3/5, 60%) than in the non-treated group (0/24, 0%) (chi 2 test, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
