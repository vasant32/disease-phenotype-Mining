<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated age-related changes in the visibility of intracranial arteries on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and the influence of risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 230 adult patients without specific neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRA was performed using the three-dimensional time-of-flight technique with a spoiled gradient-recalled acquisition sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We classified internal carotid artery (IC) and the horizontal (M1) and distal (beyond M2) middle cerebral segments into 4 grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linear regression revealed a significant negative relation between age and the quality of demonstration on MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For IC and M1, the score was significantly lower in subjects with risk factors than in those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was poorly seen in patients without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A marked correlation was observed between visibility and age patients with no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that atherosclerotic change and decline in flow velocity with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ageing are factors leading to decreased visibility on MRA </plain></SENT>
