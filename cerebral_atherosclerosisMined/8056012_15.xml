<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was designed to determine the time course of the accumulation of macrophages in the intimal layer following experimental balloon angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the extent and time course of the accumulation of macrophages after experimental balloon angioplasty, an intimal atheroma was produced by repeated weak electrical stimulation of the right carotid artery of 45 male New Zealand White rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the animals received an 0.5% cholesterol diet during the 28 days of plaque development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transluminal balloon angioplasty was subsequently performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42 days after balloon treatment the vessels from at least five animals from each group were excised and analysed for the presence of macrophages using immunocytochemical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one group of five animals plaque development occurred without subsequent balloon angioplasty; the animals were killed after 21 days (sham group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SMCs were identified by immunohistological staining of alpha-actin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intimal thickening increased after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> from 137 +/- 62 microns (control group without balloon treatment) to 244 +/- 47 microns in the 42 days after angioplasty (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The percentage of macrophages in the intimal layer displayed a significant increase (P &lt; 0.01) at 14 days after angioplasty (9.1 +/- 4.3% vs 2.0 +/- 1.7% in the control group).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
