<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To preliminarily evaluate the feasibility and potential diagnostic utility of whole-brain perfusion computed tomography (CT) performed with a prototype 256-detector row CT system over an extended range covering the entire brain to assess ischemic cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven cases in 10 subjects (six men, four women; mean age, 64.3 years) with intra- or extracranial stenosis were retrospectively evaluated with whole-brain perfusion CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three readers independently evaluated perfusion CT data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic performance of perfusion CT was visually evaluated with a three-point scale used to assess three factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences between four axial perfusion CT images obtained at the basal ganglia level (hereafter, four-section images) and whole-brain perfusion CT images were assessed with the paired t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In four subjects, the interval between perfusion CT and single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) was 1-17 days (mean, 10.3 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correlation between perfusion CT findings and SPECT findings was assessed with the Spearman correlation coefficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three-dimensional perfusion CT images and axial, coronal, and sagittal whole-brain perfusion CT images were displayed, and the extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean visual evaluation scores were significantly higher for whole-brain images than for four-section images (4.27 +/- 0.76 [standard deviation] vs 2.55 +/- 0.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cerebral blood flow ratios of the ischemic lesions relative to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> regions scanned with perfusion CT (x) and SPECT (y) showed a significant positive correlation (R(2) = 0.76, y = 0.44 x + 0.37, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Perfusion CT performed with a 256-detector row CT system can be used to assess the entire brain with administration of one contrast medium bolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, ischemic regions can be identified with one examination, which has the potential to improve diagnostic utility </plain></SENT>
