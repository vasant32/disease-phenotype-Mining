<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies of patients with bilateral intracranial vertebral artery (ICVA) disease were selective and retrospective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied risk factors, vascular lesions, symptoms, signs, and outcomes in patients with bilateral ICVA disease among 430 patients in the New England Medical Center Posterior Circulation Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-two patients had bilateral ICVA occlusive disease (18 had bilateral stenosis; 16, unilateral occlusion and contralateral stenosis; and 8, bilateral occlusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common risk factors were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (32/42 [76%]) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> (22/42 [52%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (38%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) only; 18 (43%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005296'>Occlusive vascular disease</z:hpo> also involved the basilar artery in 29 patients (69%), the extracranial vertebral arteries in 18 (43%), and the internal carotid arteries in 11 (26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 6 patients had no other major vascular lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebellar symptoms were common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 30 patients with infarction, 21 (70%) had proximal intracranial territory involvement, and 15 (50%) had distal territory involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The location of occlusive lesions in relation to posterior inferior cerebellar artery origins did not significantly influence prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 31 patients had no symptoms or slight disability, 2 had progression, and 7 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among 7 patients with poor outcome, 6 also had basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> or occlusion and 5 had proximal and distal intracranial territory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with bilateral ICVA occlusive disease have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, other major occlusive lesions, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Short- and long-term outcomes are usually favorable, but patients with bilateral ICVA and basilar artery-occlusive lesions often have poor outcomes </plain></SENT>
