<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For the subclavian arteries these values are respectively 0.73 and 0.91 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For both vessels the test has a very high negative predictive value of respectively 0.96 and 0.97 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore duplex ultrasound scanning is a reliable test in screening patients suspected of multi-level atherosclerotic disease of the extracranial cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The problem remains in classifying the degree of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the case of the vertebral artery the sample volume of the pulsed Doppler is usually too large in relation to the vessel diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the case of the subclavian and innominate artery one of the main problems is the range of the pulsed Doppler system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038531" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subclavian steal syndrome</z:e> is easily diagnosed without any special test </plain></SENT>
