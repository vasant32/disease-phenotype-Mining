<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We determined, prospectively, whether varying degrees of abnormal findings on magnetic resonance images of the brain increased the incidence of preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, postoperative neuropsychological dysfunction, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 421 elderly patients (&gt; or = 60 years) undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Control patients (almost <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or leukoaraiosis, n = 212) had rates of postoperative neuropsychological dysfunction (7%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (1.4%); the small infarctions group (some small infarctions, n = 126) had rates of 13% and 5.6%, respectively; whereas patients with multiple infarctions (multiple small infarctions or broad infarctions, n = 83) had rates of 20% and 8.4%, respectively (p = 0.004, p = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the group with multiple infarctions, 49 patients (59%) were asymptomatic and 21 patients (25%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the significant predictors of multiple small infarctions or large infarctions were history of cerebrovascular disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Multiple infarctions significantly increase the risk of neurologic dysfunction after coronary artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Routine screening for preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> should be performed to detect underlying ischemic cerebral disease in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
