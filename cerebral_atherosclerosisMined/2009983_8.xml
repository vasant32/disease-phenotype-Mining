<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Colour-flow duplex scanning was performed to determine the extent of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Major internal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> (MICAD), meaning 75% stenosis and/or occlusion, was found in 14.9% (62) of the patients; 12.5% (52) had unilateral disease and 2.4% (10) had bilateral disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 7.7% (32) there was a stenosis of 75-99% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An occlusion was seen in 7.2% (30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the severity of the internal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> and the severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 16.0% (60) prevalence in MICAD in patients with obstructive disease was significantly higher than the 4.7% (2) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> patients (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results show that there was no correlation between MICAD and the risk factors: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, gender, age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, hypercholestolaemia, smoking and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The high prevalence of MICAD in patients with PAD suggests that it would be useful to start a screening programme to determine if high grade stenosis should be operated upon </plain></SENT>
