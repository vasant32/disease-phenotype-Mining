<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography technique employed contiguous axial flow-sensitive (short TR/TE) slices that were reformatted and postprocessed by using a maximum-intensity projection algorithm to provide 16 angiographic views of the carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both studies were independently reviewed by two observers in a blinded manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carotid arteries were categorized as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, mildly stenotic, moderately stenotic, severely stenotic, or occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the 94 carotid arteries available for review, one observer reported a 70% agreement between the two techniques and the second observer reported a 56% agreement (p = .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The best correlation was in the severely stenotic category and the worst was in the occluded category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Agreement between observers was 67% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography and 72% for contrast angiography, which was similar to that between the two techniques </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While further improvements are needed, use of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography as the primary diagnostic tool for many patients with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> should continue to increase </plain></SENT>
