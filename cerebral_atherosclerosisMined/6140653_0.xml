<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve (27%) of the 45 patients progressed to complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with severe <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> and with intracranial arterial lesions or with lesions of both intracranial and extracranial sites were predominant among the 29 cases examined angiographically, and the majority progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prognosis was poorer than in the cases with mild <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> or cases with only extracranial arterial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From such characteristics of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> in the Japanese with predominant intracranial severe arterial lesions, a different genesis for the development of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> between Japanese and Americans or other Caucasians may be expected in cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With respect to the relation of recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> to prognosis, a single episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> in the past placed the patient at a greater risk of early infarction, where a high incidence (57%) of progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was found during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment by superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery anastomosis or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> drug medication seemed to improve the prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> as compared with antiplatelet aggregation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> formation from an embolic source of arterial lesions may play some part in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and occurrence of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
