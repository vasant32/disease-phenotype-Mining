<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>From 1977 to 1984, 752 reconstructions of the supra-aortic arteries were performed at our service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a group of 31 patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (13) or minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (15), preoperative multiplane angiograms identified lesions from various causes in extremely high locations (fibromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 10; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, 6; traumatic changes, 10; spontaneous dissection, 3; and mycotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and others, 4) in 34 internal carotid arteries (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 10; and stenosis, 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surgery was performed on 30 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow restoration was achieved by resection and vein graft replacement (20), gradual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (5), thromboendarterectomy (6), and tangential clip for exclusion of a lateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only one patient was treated with an extracranial-intracranial anastomosis because the stenosis extended into the carotid siphon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient was treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exposure of the internal carotid artery (ICA) at the base of the skull required dissection of the digastric muscle, careful mobilization of the cranial nerves, and detachment of the styloid process in 29 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Partial resection of the mastoid process was helpful in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The carotid bone canal was opened from the lateral side in four cases to allow the most distal anastomosis 1 cm within the carotid canal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Back-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was controlled by a balloon catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A shunt was impossible to use and clamping time averaged 62 +/- 40 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Except for one recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> no other neurologic deficits occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cranial nerve damage could not be avoided in 21 cases (nervus recurrens, 7; nervus glossopharyngeus, 16; and nervus facialis, 4) but disappeared clinically within a 1- to 6-month period in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Each surgical patient underwent control angiography, which demonstrated 30 arteries to be patent, two became occluded, and one had an insignificant stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We conclude that standard surgical techniques are unsuitable for repair of highly located lesions of the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although extracranial-intracranial anastomosis has been proposed in patients with planned ligation of the ICA, the anatomic reconstruction remains advantageous because flow is restored to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and the source of emboli is eliminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>With the use of a special approach, graft replacement can be performed up to the base of the skull </plain></SENT>
