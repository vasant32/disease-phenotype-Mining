<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The apparent differences in risk factors for intra- and extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> are unclear and the mechanisms that underlie <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> are not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the conventional vascular risk factors as well as other factors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with large artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and vascular and cardiologic studies, we selected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-cardioembolic cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> within the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups: those with <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> on the carotid sinus (n = 112) and those with isolated lesions on the proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (n = 160) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical features, risk factors, and DWI patterns were compared between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no differences in conventional risk factors, but markers for <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were significantly higher in patients with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> than in those with isolated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.01 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustments for age/sex and the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, an inverse correlation was observed between C-reactive protein levels and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (odds ratio 0.57 per 1 mg/dl increase; 95% confidence interval 0.35 to 0.92; p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Internal borderzone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> suggestive of haemodynamic causes were the most frequent DWI pattern in patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, whereas territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> suggesting plaque ruptures were most common in those with carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that inflammatory markers, rather than conventional risk factors, reveal clinical and radiological differences between patients with carotid and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Plaques associated with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> may be more stable than those associated with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
