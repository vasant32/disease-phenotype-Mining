<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our hypothesis was that uncontrolled alcohol consumption may cause cerebrovascular damage detectable by rheoencepholography (REG), a noninvasive bio-impedance technique for estimating cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Test subjects were 48 alcoholic patients in Hungary; the control group consisted of 12 drug-addicted and depressed patients in Hungary and 13 healthy male subjects in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional subgroups were formed according to smoking habits and average daily alcohol dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>REG was measured by a computer-based system, "Cerberus"; REG anacrotic time above 180 ms was considered pathological </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ANOVA showed that daily alcohol consumption and smoking were significantly higher in alcoholics than in drug-addicted and depressed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve alcoholics showed a pathological REG anacrotic time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Longer REG anacrotic time was correlated with higher daily alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the alcoholic group, the steeper regression line of REG slope reflected the pathological impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085762" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="aca">alcohol abuse</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The healthy control sample showed a nearly identical slope for both REG and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The correlation of increased REG anacrotic time and daily alcohol consumption supports the hypothesis that REG detects accelerated cerebrovascular aging (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>) in alcoholic subjects </plain></SENT>
