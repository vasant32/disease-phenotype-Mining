<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only a few studies of the incidence of carotid lesions in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> (CPAD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) have been made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus the aim of this study was to investigate the pathoanatomy of the carotid arteries in a representative number of patients suffering from CPAD or MI by using highly sensitive and specific noninvasive methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results by other authors are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors' own study of cerebrovascular disease (CD), which covers epidemiologic aspects, is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methods: "duplex scanning" and continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, N = 73; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo>, N = 112; cerebrovascular disease, N = 73 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results: MI: stenosis greater than 50% N = 31 (42.4% of cases) - in the case of recurring infarction 67.8% of cases; CPAD: stenosis greater than 50% N = 54 (48.2%); CD: stenosis greater than 50% N = 35 (48%) </plain></SENT>
