<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The literature contains relatively few reports of distal embolism associated with intervention for intracranial atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to evaluate the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) or stent placement in this setting by using diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between October 1999 and January 2004, 16 consecutive patients with symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> greater than 60% were treated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> or stent placement without a protection system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whole-brain DW imaging was performed before and after intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DW imaging findings were retrospectively analyzed and divided into three groups according to new hyperintensities: type A was none; type B, a single lesion; and type C, multiple lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine type A, five type B, and three type C lesions were detected after the interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> hyperintense lesions were less than 5 mm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> type C lesions occurred in the context of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> treated with stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DW imaging abnormalities occurred most frequently when <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> followed by stent placement was performed for long internal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery stenoses</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No new neurologic deficits occurred in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this series, <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> or stent placement or both for intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> was safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>New DW imaging abnormalities were less frequent in patients who underwent <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> alone or primary stent placement than in those receiving <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> followed by stent placement </plain></SENT>
