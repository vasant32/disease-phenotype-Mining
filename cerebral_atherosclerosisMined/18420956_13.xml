<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracranial angioplasty and stenting are therapeutic options for patients with symptomatic intracranial arterial stenoses intractable to medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the long-term safety and clinical efficacy of these techniques are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to assess the long-term outcome and efficacy of these techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Procedural data and 30-day outcomes were collected from patients treated with coronary balloons and stents for &gt;/=70% atherostenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and radiographic follow-up data were obtained at 30 days, 6 months, 12 months, and yearly thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (median age, 67 years; interquartile range [IQR], 58.75 to 75 years) with 69 arterial lesions were treated during a 7-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The technical success rate was 98.6% (68/69), with a reduction of the median percent stenosis from 85% (IQR, 70% to 95%) to 0% (IQR, 0% to 26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 76.8% (53/69) of the procedures, a stent was implanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 10.1% (7/69) with 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and within a median follow-up of 24 months (IQR, 10.25 to 36.5 months), the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate reached 5.8% (4/69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Restenosis rate at 1 year was 15.9% (11/69) and was symptomatic in 18.2% (2/11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The restenosis rate was 50% for angioplasty (8/16) and 7.5% (4/53) for stenting (hazard ratio=5.02; 95% CI, 1.22 to 20.68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with restenosis were vessel size &lt;2.5 mm (hazard ratio=4.78; 95% CI, 1.35 to 16.93) and interventions performed in the setting of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (hazard ratio=6.36; 95% CI, 1.78 to 22.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial stenting may reduce the rate of recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in patients in whom medical therapy is unsuccessful and is probably more durable than angioplasty alone </plain></SENT>
