<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although it has been suggested that bilateral symmetry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> can be found in paired arteries, including external carotid arteries and femoral arteries, it has remained unknown in intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined whether bilateral symmetry (a mirror pattern) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> presents in the entire cerebral arterial system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Angiographic findings of 795 consecutive patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, after excluding those with cardiac sources of embolism or other causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence (location) and severity (the degree of stenosis) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were compared between left and right sides at 26 predetermined arteries/segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found 2230 lesions in predetermined segments/arteries from 669 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Amongst 509 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> at two or more arteries/segments, mirror patterns were observed in 312 patients (61.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mirror pattern increased steeply as the number of atherosclerotic arteries increased and was most frequently found in the carotid bulb (C1, 26.7%), followed by the middle cerebral artery (M1, 14.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The severity of stenosis was also correlated between left and right sides, and the correlation was highest in the C1 (r = 0.40, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that the mirror patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were more obvious in C1 and associated with a past history of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the number of stenotic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in cerebral arteries may develop and progress in a mirror pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007201'>cerebral artery atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, the occurrence and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the contralateral cerebral artery should be considered during follow-up examination </plain></SENT>
