<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> of varying dosages was determined and the distribution and general character of occlusive vascular lesions which developed were analyzed by light and transmission electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was found that a dose exceeding 55 mg of the atheromatous material (125 mg/ml saline) was lethal in New Zealand white male rabbits weighing between 3 and 5 kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In nonsurviving animals, parts of the Circle of Willis and usually one or more of its major tributaries were occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some surviving animals exhibited signs of neurologic deficit evidenced by motor dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Occlusive vascular lesions found in surviving animals were predominantly localized in ipsilateral cortical and subcortical vessels within the distribution territory of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The character of occlusive lesions showed strong evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrated that this experimental system may be useful as a model for the study of blood-atheroembolic vascular reactions, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> development and the testing of agents potentially prophylactic against the development or stabilization of occlusive lesions </plain></SENT>
