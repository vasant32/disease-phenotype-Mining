<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For evaluation of small peripheral arteries, 10 patients with clinical diagnosis of ischemic cerebrovascular disease and 10 healthy volunteers were investigated, and for evaluation of stenosis, another 6 patients were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vascular images were obtained by three-dimensional time-of-flight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a baseline scan, 17 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> was injected intravenously and the second scan was performed 20 minutes later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Several small peripheral arteries that had not been seen on the baseline images were visible on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> images without any augmentation of the background signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stenotic lesions in the main trunks of the major cerebral arteries were detected more clearly on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">Acetazolamide</z:chebi> improves visualization of small peripheral intracranial arteries and sensitivity in detecting atherosclerotic stenosis in the main trunk of major cerebral artery by three-dimensional time-of-flight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography without changing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> apparatus and software </plain></SENT>
