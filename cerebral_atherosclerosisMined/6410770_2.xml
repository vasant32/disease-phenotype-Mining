<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the iodinated contrast material is a nondiffusable indicator, it does not pass through the bloodbrain barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, this method is capable of measuring the relative tissue blood flow (intravascular blood flow) but incapable of measuring the absolute cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it does allow the three-dimensional measurement of cerebral hemodynamics by a simple procedure, and when the primarily clear brain structure seen with CT is considered, it is a very useful diagnostic method </plain></SENT>
