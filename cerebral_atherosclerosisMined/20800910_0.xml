<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 268 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> to assess the relationship between intracranial (IC) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and WMH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were classified into three groups according to the location of the stenosis; IC, extracranial (EC), and non-stenosis (NS) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>WMH were rated using the semiquantitative method of Scheltens and coworkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The IC group had significantly more WMH score in comparison with the other groups after controlling age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The linear regression analysis showed that age was the factor most strongly associated with the total score of WMH; and the location of stenosis was positively related to WMH, especially in deep white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data show that IC stenosis is associated with WMH, indicating that IC stenosis, rather than EC stenosis, is likely to cause white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings raise the possibility that occlusion of penetrating arteries, embolism to border-zone areas and a hemodynamic mechanism associated with IC stenosis leads to the formation of white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
