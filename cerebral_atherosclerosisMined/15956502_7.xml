<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between May 1998 and June 2004, 73 symptomatic stenotic (&gt;50%) intracranial arteries were successfully treated with stent-assisted angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 11 cases, standard techniques of navigating the stent-delivery system into the intended lesion failed because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004948'>vascular tortuosity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these difficult cases, several techniques were used to overcome the tortuosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five lesions were located in the middle cerebral arteries, four were in the supraclinoid internal carotid arteries, and two were in the distal vertebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> difficult cases, stents were successfully placed in the intracranial artery by using several techniques: 1) waiting method in which we waited for 20-30 minutes after advancement of the microwire across the lesion, 2) the double-wire technique, and 3) the coaxial double-guiding catheter technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The waiting method made smooth stent navigation possible in five cases, the double-wire technique was successful in four cases, and the coaxial double-guiding catheter technique was effective in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No technique-related complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In difficult cases in which standard techniques of navigating the stent-delivery system into the intended lesion fail because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004948'>vascular tortuosity</z:hpo>, our techniques were useful methods for intracranial stent navigation </plain></SENT>
