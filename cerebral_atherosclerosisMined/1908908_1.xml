<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent carotid duplex scanning and CT scanning before carotid arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two hundred thirty-seven patients (51%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, 109 (23%) had a prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and 122 (26%) were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results of the CT scan were abnormal in 68 (62%) of the 109 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one of the 360 patients (14%) without a clinical history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had an abnormal CT scan outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> documented by CT scanning, 27 had lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and 92 had cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>; these findings did not change surgical management in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CT scanning did not reveal any unsuspected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two hundred thirty carotid endarterectomies were performed on 206 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven patients (23%) in the operative group had abnormal CT scan findings, but the scan did not influence operative decisions or timing in any case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two patients (27%) in the nonoperative group had abnormal CT scan results, but CT scan findings did not exclude any patient from arteriography or surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (1.3%) occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CT scan findings did not correlate with postoperative neurologic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cost of CT scanning was one-half million dollars in our study alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Routine CT scanning is unnecessary before carotid endarterectomy and is not cost-effective </plain></SENT>
