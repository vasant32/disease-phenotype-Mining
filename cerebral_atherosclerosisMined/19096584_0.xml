<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> has become a major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, appearing more frequently in Koreans than Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic or asymptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is a disease that could recur readily even during the treatment with anti-platelet agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When the symptoms develop, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> can not be recovered readily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, aggressive treatments such as endovascular therapy and bypass surgery are required in addition to medical treatment for the intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent intracranial stenting and drug eluting stenting have shown as very advanced effective therapeutic modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, until now, a randomized controlled study has not been conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regarding bypass surgery, since the failed EC-IC bypass surgery study performed 20 years ago, extensive studies on its efficacy has not been conducted yet, and thus it has to be performed strictly only in hemodynamically compromised patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unless breakthrough drugs that suppress the progression of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and the formation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, and facilitate the regression of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo>, the treatment concept of the recovery of the blood flow of stenotic arterial territory by mechanical recanalization or bypass surgery would be remained for the prevention as well as treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> caused by intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
