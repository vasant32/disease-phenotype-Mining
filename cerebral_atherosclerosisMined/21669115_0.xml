<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Past exposure to human cytomegalovirus has been suggested to participate in the pathogenetic events associated with atherosclerotic lesion establishment and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whether ongoing human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cytomegalovirus infection</z:e> is related to plaque instability, and subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, is relatively unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential relationships between active human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cytomegalovirus infection</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, especially in regard to metabolism and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients, associated with large artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of human cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin M (IgM) (human cytomegalovirus-IgM-positive/human cytomegalovirus-IgM-negative = 33:66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline clinical characteristics, inflammatory factors, and biochemical assessments were compared in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and human cytomegalovirus-IgM-positive patients were divided into quartiles according to their high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, respectively, and risk factors were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, correlations between inflammatory factors (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and white blood cell count) and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> risk factors in both human cytomegalovirus-IgM-positive and -negative subjects were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An association between human cytomegalovirus-IgM seropositivity and atherogenic modification of metabolism and inflammatory status were not found in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both age and white blood cell count increased across quartiles of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects (P = 0.001), while age and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> increased across quartiles of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in the human cytomegalovirus-IgM-positive group (P = 0.02 and 0.007, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that high-sensitivity C-reactive protein was associated with age in human cytomegalovirus-IgM-positive group (P = 0.002), while no other factor was associated with white blood cell count in these subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study provided no evidence for the direct implication of active systemic human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cytomegalovirus infection</z:e>, represented by human cytomegalovirus-IgM positivity, in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo>, particularly those involving plaque instability and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
