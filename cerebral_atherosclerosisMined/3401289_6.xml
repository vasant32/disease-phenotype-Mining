<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The genetic deficiency has been preserved in the resulting offspring through many generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Litter numbers, live <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gains</z:mp> and energy intake are similar to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Free and esterified cholesterol in serum, and total cholesterol in very low density plus <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoproteins</z:chebi>, are markedly increased in homozygote, but only slightly raised in heterozygote, animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">High density lipoprotein-cholesterols</z:chebi> show an opposite trend but with less marked differences between the genetic strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Liver total and esterified cholesterol levels were substantially increased in homozygotes, and the ability of liver membranes to bind human 125I-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> was markedly reduced, owing to a reduction of the number of high-affinity binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals with serum cholesterol values greater than 14 mmol/l at weaning developed extensive aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> within 16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The early lesions had the histological appearances of fatty streaks and progressed to complicated disease at 6-12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A distinctive pattern of calcific <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>, quite different from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, was observed in most aging heterozygote animals and was associated with extensive renal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_36'>calcium deposition</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001084'>Corneal arcus</z:hpo> developed in some homozygotes but there was no evidence of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that homozygotes of this modified strain can be used for macroscopic studies of the progression of aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the first 4 months after weaning but after this period a combination of macroscopic and microscopic techniques are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Heterozygotes are unsuitable for studies of this nature </plain></SENT>
