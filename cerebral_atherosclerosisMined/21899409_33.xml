<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> is an important cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that is increasingly being treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) to prevent recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, PTAS has not been compared with medical management in a randomized trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We randomly assigned patients who had a recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> attributed to stenosis of 70 to 99% of the diameter of a major intracranial artery to aggressive medical management alone or aggressive medical management plus PTAS with the use of the Wingspan stent system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 30 days after enrollment or after a revascularization procedure for the qualifying lesion during the follow-up period or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the territory of the qualifying artery beyond 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Enrollment was stopped after 451 patients underwent randomization, because the 30-day rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 14.7% in the PTAS group (nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 12.5%; fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 2.2%) and 5.8% in the medical-management group (nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 5.3%; non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, 0.4%) (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Beyond 30 days, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the same territory occurred in 13 patients in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Currently, the mean duration of follow-up, which is ongoing, is 11.9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The probability of the occurrence of a primary end-point event over time differed significantly between the two treatment groups (P=0.009), with 1-year rates of the primary end point of 20.0% in the PTAS group and 12.2% in the medical-management group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo>, aggressive medical management was superior to PTAS with the use of the Wingspan stent system, both because the risk of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after PTAS was high and because the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with aggressive medical therapy alone was lower than expected </plain></SENT>
