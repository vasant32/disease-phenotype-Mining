<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this investigation was to determine the importance of race as a determinant of intracranial atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a community-based <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Residents from northern Manhattan over age 39 years hospitalized for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (n = 438, black 35%, Hispanic 46%, white 19%) were prospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Index <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> were classified as atherosclerotic (17%), lacunar (30%), cardioembolic (21%), cryptogenic (31%), and other (1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Atherosclerotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were subdivided into extracranial (9%) and intracranial (8%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportion of extracranial atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was similar among the three race-ethnic groups, while intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was more frequent in blacks and Hispanics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The unadjusted odds ratio for nonwhites (blacks and Hispanics combined) was 0.8 (confidence interval [CI], 0.4 to 1.8) for extracranial and 7.8 (CI, 1.04 to 57.7) for intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with intracranial disease were significantly younger and had an increased frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002056'>insulin-dependent diabetes</z:mp> compared with those with nonatherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio for the association of nonwhite race-ethnicity and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was reduced to 5.2 (CI, 0.7 to 40) after controlling for age and to 4.4 (CI, 0.6 to 35) after controlling for age, education, <z:mp ids='MP_0002056'>insulin-dependent diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The greater prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> among blacks and Hispanics from northern Manhattan accounted for much of the increased frequency of intracranial atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further control of these risk factors could reduce the frequency of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype and minimize the disparities among different race-ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
