<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The following facts were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Examination of the brachial blood flow pattern in circulatory stress, i.e., hand-grasping, brachial-binding, cold- and warm-stimulating tests revealed that the more the peripheral vascular resistance was increased, the more was the discontinuity of brachial blood flow pattern increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Investigation of the continuity of the cerebral blood flow pattern (internal carotid artery) in 18 young healthy persons and 46 elderly patients with cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> revealed a continuous pattern in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the young persons, while the discontinuous pattern was frequently observed in the elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the cerebral vascular resistance is more increased in the elderly patients than in the young persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cerebral blood flow pattern was classified into the following three types according to the continuity of the cerebral blood flow pattern: continuous, intermediate and discontinuous type, and the relation to the Continuous Index (CI), which was devised as an objective parameter of the continuity, was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The following CI figures were obtained: 110-200% in the young persons; in the elderly patients: continuous type, 120-185%; intermediate type, 85-135%; discontinuous type, 50-85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From the above findings it is postulated that the Doppler ultrasonic technique is useful for the quantitative detection of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>, i.e., anticipation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vascular accidents</z:e>, and for the discrimination between arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
