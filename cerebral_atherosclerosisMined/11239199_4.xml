<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The second goal was to determine whether the role of sGC in mediating responses to nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> is altered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Basilar arteries from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and atherosclerotic monkeys were studied in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After precontraction with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F(2alpha) (0.1 to 1 micromol/L), concentration-response curves to authentic nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (1 nmol/L to 1 micromol/L), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> (10 nmol/L to 10 micromol/L; a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50566">nitric oxide donor</z:chebi>), and papaverine (10 nmol/L to 10 micromol/L; a non-nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>, non-sGC-dependent stimulus) were generated in the presence and absence of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29300">1H-</z:chebi>[1,2,4]-oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ; 1 and 10 micromol/L; an inhibitor of sGC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of ODQ on basal tone of basilar arteries from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and atherosclerotic monkeys was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi>, and papaverine produced relaxation that was similar (P:&gt;0.05) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and atherosclerotic monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ODQ produced marked inhibition (P:&lt;0.05) of vasorelaxation in response to nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7596">nitroprusside</z:chebi> but not papaverine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For example, relaxation of the basilar artery in response to nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (0.1 micromol/L) was inhibited by approximately 85% and 73% by ODQ (1 micromol/L) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and atherosclerotic monkeys, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ODQ produced contraction of the basilar arteries, and the increase in tension to ODQ was greater in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (2.7+/-0.3 g; mean+/-SE) than in atherosclerotic monkeys (1.4+/-0.4 g; P:&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, contraction to <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> F(2alpha) was similar in the basilar artery from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and atherosclerotic monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that (1) relaxation of cerebral arteries in primates in response to nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> is normally dependent, in large part, on activation of sGC and (2) the influence of sGC (via reduced production and/or activity of basal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>) on cerebral vascular tone is reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
