<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was done to evaluate the clinical and angiographic outcomes after intracranial angioplasty for this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 120 patients with 124 intracranial stenoses were treated by primary angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had neurologic symptoms (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>) attributable to intracranial stenoses &gt; or =50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiograms were evaluated before and after angioplasty for the degree of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pretreatment stenoses varied from 50% to 95% (mean 82.2+/-10.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Post-treatment stenoses varied from 0% to 90% (mean 36.0+/-20.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neurological) within 30 days of the procedure, giving a combined periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate of 5.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 116 patients (96.7%) were available for a mean follow-up time of 42.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 6 patients who had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the territory of treatment and 5 additional patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in other territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred during the follow-up period, none of which were neurological </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Including the periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, this yielded an annual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate of 3.2% in the territory of treatment and a 4.4% annual rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial angioplasty can be performed with a high degree of technical success and a low risk of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Long-term clinical follow-up of intracranial angioplasty patients demonstrates a risk of future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> that compares favorably to patients receiving medical therapy </plain></SENT>
