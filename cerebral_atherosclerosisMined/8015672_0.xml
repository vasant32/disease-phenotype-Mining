<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE Quantitative measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) needs special equipment or invasive blood sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, with a popularly used rotating gamma camera, we tried to establish a convenient modality of qualitative evaluation of hemodynamics in patients with atherosclerotic large-artery disease, according to the distribution pattern of isotope-uptake on SPECT image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS Forty-one patients with atherosclerotic large-artery disease [9 internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis, 17 ICA occlusion, 8 middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) stenosis, and 7 MCA occlusion] and 32 control patients documented as having small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> without atherosclerotic large-artery disease were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the rotating gamma camera, they underwent 123I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> SPECT at baseline and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> loading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to the distribution pattern of low isotope-uptake, early images were classified into four types: Type I: no low uptake, Type II: low uptake in a single watershed, Type III: low uptake in two watersheds with or without a partial <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory, Type IV: low uptake in a whole <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT In patients with large-artery disease, baseline images presented Type I in 12 cases, Type II in 16, Type III in 9, Type IV in 4, and loading images Type I in 3, Type II in 2, Type III in 8, Type IV in 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 37 patients except for 4 belonging to Type IV at baseline, 32 (86.5%) had a more extensive low isotope-uptake area after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> loading than at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In control patients, baseline images presented Type I in 25, Type II in 7, and the Type III &amp; IV in 0, and the Type after loading was the same as the Type at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION We established the qualitative evaluation of 123I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> SPECT image by detecting the "extent" of the ischemic region, taking notice of watershed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pathognomonic findings on SPECT image of atherosclerotic large-artery disease showed that low isotope-uptake area at baseline extended into two watersheds or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> loading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The modality of qualitative evaluation based on these pathognomic findings of SPECT image may be useful for easily assessing patients with atherosclerotic large-artery disease using a rotating gamma camera </plain></SENT>
