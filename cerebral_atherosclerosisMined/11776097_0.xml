<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the changes in hypertensive cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> and the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats following treatment with Tanakan, a preparation of Ginkgo Biloba (GB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using two-kidney, two clip renovascular hypertensive rats (RHRs) as animal models--we investigated changes in these hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>-associated factors: A I, A II, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALD</z:e>, ET, SOD and cGMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood levels were observed after oral administration of GB, at both early and late stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> was more severe in both RHRs control and the later treated group than in the early treated group, with blood levels of A I, A II, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALD</z:e> and ET in the former two groups significantly elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> in the early treated group decreased and the blood levels of A I, A II, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALD</z:e> and ET in this group decreased nearly to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The blood levels of SOD and cGMP were also elevated in the early treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results reveal that it is important to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> as soon as possible, in order to reduce the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
