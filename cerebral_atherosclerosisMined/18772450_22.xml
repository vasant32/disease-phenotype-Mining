<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Institutional Review Board approved the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis was performed of 30 fusiform dissecting and atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated in 28 patients (20 females; mean age, 52.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (37%) were located in the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one (70%) originated from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> and 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (13%) presented with subarachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four (80%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated with stents and coils, whereas 6 (20%) were treated with stents alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immediate postprocedural angiograms in 24 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated with stent-assisted coiling showed complete occlusion in 12 and subtotal occlusion in 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, whereas no occlusion was seen in one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated with stents alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A clinical improvement or stable outcome was achieved in 25 patients (89%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 2 cases of permanent morbidity included a patient with a finger dysesthesia associated with a perforator <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and another patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> due to a delayed in-stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient died after treatment of a giant vertebrobasilar junction <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Angiographic follow-up was available in 23 of the 27 surviving patients (85%) at a mean of 16.2 months (range, 1 to 108 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recanalization in 4 patients (17%) at 3, 5, 24, and 36 months required retreatment in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In-stent stenosis of &lt;or=50% was found in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stent-assisted coil embolization is an attractive option for ruptured and nonruptured fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with stable long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, recanalization observed up to 3 years after the initial obliteration emphasizes the need for long-term follow-up angiography </plain></SENT>
