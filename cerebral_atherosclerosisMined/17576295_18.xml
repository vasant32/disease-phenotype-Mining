<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detailed neurocognitive testing was performed in 25 hemodialysis patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores &gt;24 and had no history of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Where appropriate, scores were normalized for age, gender, and education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One-sample t tests were used to compare differences in cognitive function between dialysis patients and normative data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 57 years, and the mean MMSE was 27.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen subjects (56%) were females, and 15 white (60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results of the North American Adult Reading Test, a measure of verbal intelligence, were comparable with the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, measures of cortical function, namely retention and recognition scores from the Word List Learning subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale-III, were preserved when compared with normative data where reference = 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant deficits were seen on tests assessing subcortical function: scores (mean+/-standard deviation) for block design, and symbol coding subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III were 7.0+/-1.7 and 7.7+/-3.1, respectively (p&lt;0.001 for both comparisons with normative data) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly, adjusted scores on the trails A and B tests were 40.5+/-8.3 and 41.8+/-11.3, respectively (p&lt;0.001 for both comparisons with normative data where reference= 50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that, despite relatively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MMSE scores, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> may be prevalent in hemodialysis patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The pattern of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> is primarily subcortical in nature </plain></SENT>
