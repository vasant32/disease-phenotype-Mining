<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When the neck of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is thick due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> or there is a marked <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> inside the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, clipping may not be possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report three cases with large internal carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> that were evaluated for the thickness of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> wall and the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> by 3 tesla magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A high-resolution T2-weighted imaging (HRT2WI) modified for 3 tesla was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two cases, the images showed the thickened wall of the dome to some extent which apparently did not reach the neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were successfully neck clipped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The third patient showed marked thickening of the wall, which may be associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, which extended to the neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative findings of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> wall were compatible with these factors, and removal of atherosclerotic plaque and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> from the neck and dome of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was necessary before successful neck clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The HRT2WI may contribute to a better surgical strategy for large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> which may have wall thickening </plain></SENT>
