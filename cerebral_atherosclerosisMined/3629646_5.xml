<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the association between carotid plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> and symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> a retrospective review of 200 consecutive carotid endarterectomies at the Neurological Institute of New York was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data analyzed included cerebral ischemic symptoms, angiographic findings, preoperative use of antithrombotic agents, and microscopic pathology of endarterectomy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No association was found between ischemic symptoms ipsilateral to the endarterectomy and presence, size, or age of plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> were less common among patients who took antithrombotic agents preoperatively than among those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> was associated with angiographic carotid cross-sectional area stenosis of greater than 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with stenosis of less than 75% were more likely than those with stenosis of greater than 75% to have ischemic symptoms ipsilateral to the endarterectomy, suggesting that criteria for surgical treatment of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> differ for those who are symptomatic vs. those who are asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate the limitation of using a surgical series to extend causal inferences about the relation between plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> and cerebral ischemic symptoms to the general population of people with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
