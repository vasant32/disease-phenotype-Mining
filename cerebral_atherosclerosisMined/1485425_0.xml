<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was established that nicergolin reduces the arterial pressure, diminishes the minute blood volume, cardiac and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> indices, increases the specific peripheral vascular resistance, the linear blood flow velocity prevailingly in the stenosed major head arteries, results in a regression of the subjective and objective neurological symptomatology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Considering the cardiodepressive effect of nicergolin, this agent is indicated in patients with the hyperkinetic type of the systemic hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
