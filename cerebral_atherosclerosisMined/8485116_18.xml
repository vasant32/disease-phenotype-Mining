<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e>, we analyzed a sample of 909 men and women (aged 40-79 years) drawn from the community-based Bruneck <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">Ischemic Heart Disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Prevention Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For the four decades of age (40-49, 50-59, 60-69, and 70-79 years), respective prevalence rates as assessed by duplex scanning were found to be 8.2%, 39.7%, 66.4%, and 82.5% in men and 3.3%, 22.3%, 48.7%, and 76.7% in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High-grade stenosis (&gt; 80%) classified by Doppler criteria was twice as frequent in men (2.4%) as in women (1.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age and sex were found to be particularly strong and independent predictors of asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, separate logistic regression models were developed for both men and women in the elderly (65-79 years) and middle-aged (50-64 years) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Systolic blood pressure turned out to be the only attribute with independent significance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subgroups examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cigarette smoking, recorded as pack-years, emerged as the leading risk factor of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum fibrinogen levels were found to be highly indicative of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> in elderly men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B predictive significance was observed in the middle-aged populations, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I had a protective effect in elderly women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> completed the risk factor profile for elderly men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, the relation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> showed a dynamic dependence on sex and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings may help to improve the efficacy of risk prediction in the general population and facilitate well-directed preventive measures </plain></SENT>
