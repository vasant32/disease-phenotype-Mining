<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one patients with intracerebral stenosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> were studied by computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebral arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical symptoms were varied, included impaired cognitive functions, progressive neurological deficit, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, and were sometimes not suggestives of the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT scans of the brain were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 25 percent of the cases or they were not probative because of various and non-specific abnormalities (hypodensity of various types or haemorrhagic hyperdensity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI always showed abnormalities but in many cases the lesions observed on T2-weighted images consisted of non-specific focal areas of high-intensity signal in the white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High-intensity signals in both white matter and cortex seemed to be more suggestive of the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this as in other studies, arteriography therefore remains the reference examination for stenosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory, infectious and atheromatous processes are the main causes of these arterial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The aetiological value of radiological examinations is poor, and in most cases the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and distribution of the lesions does not point to any specific origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">herpes zoster</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> usually affects the proximal segments of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries and spares the carotid siphon </plain></SENT>
