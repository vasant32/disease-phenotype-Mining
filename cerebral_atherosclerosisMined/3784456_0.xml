<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A haemorheological analysis with measured blood filterability was carried out on 179 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reduced blood filterability appeared to be related to the clinical condition: time variation (two phase course), influence of complications and of fatal prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The underlying mechanism of the haemorheological disorders involved three groups of factors: quantitative and qualitative abnormalities of plasma proteins, red cells disturbances and white cells activation, leading to both local and general hyperviscosity, producing a prothrombotic state and a defective microcirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The haemorheological treatments are of value to the patients although the relationship between hemodilution and the filterability remains to be exactly defined, as well as a better understanding of the action of the drugs </plain></SENT>
