<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>General, local, and short-term reactions of increased cerebral blood volume could be distinguished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the EEG changes and cerebral blood volume was most obvious during the short-term reactions: EEG-desynchronization was always followed by increased blood volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggests a possible neurogenic element in vascular reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular pathology was concluded to affect both the neurogenic and the metabolic components of the regulatory mechanism of local circulation </plain></SENT>
