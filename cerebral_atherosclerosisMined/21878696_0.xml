<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the association between cortical BZRs decreases and executive dysfunctions, we measured BZRs using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) and (11)C-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5103">flumazenil</z:chebi> in 60 non-disabled patients with unilateral atherosclerotic ICA or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease and no cortical infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using 3-dimensional stereotactic surface projections, we calculated the BZR index, a measure of abnormally decreased BZRs in the cerebral cortex within the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory, and found that it to be correlated with the patient's score on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on the WCST results, 39 patients were considered abnormal (low categories achieved) for their age </plain></SENT>
