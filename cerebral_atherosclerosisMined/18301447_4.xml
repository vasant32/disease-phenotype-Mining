<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (IS) remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated a possible link between IS or the severity of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and the APOE promoter polymorphisms -219G/T and +113G/C, involved in regulating APOE transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We genotyped subjects from a multicentric Belgian case-control study, including 237 middle-aged patients with IS due to small- or large-vessel atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 326 ethnicity- and gender-matched controls and a Finnish autopsy series of 1004 non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases, who had received a quantitative score of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The APOE epsilon4+ genotype did not associate with IS, but was related to more severe intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> score in men (5.4 vs 4.6, P=0.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the most common APOE epsilon3/epsilon3 genotype group, the risk of IS associated with the G-allele of the tightly linked -219G/T (OR=6.2; 95% CI: 1.6-24.3, P=0.009) and +113G/C (OR=7.1; 95% CI: 1.7-29.9, P=0.007) promoter polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the severity of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> between -219G/G genotype carriers and non-carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study suggests a multifaceted role of apoE on the risk of cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The APOE epsilon4+ genotype did not predict the risk of IS but was associated with severity of subclinical intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in men on the autopsy study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the promoter variants were significant predictors of IS, suggesting that quantitative rather than qualitative variation of apoE is related to IS </plain></SENT>
