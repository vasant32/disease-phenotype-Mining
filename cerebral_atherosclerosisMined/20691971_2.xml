<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Despite compelling evidence of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) [Lp(a)] as a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, its underlying mechanism remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim is to investigate whether serum Lp(a) level is associated with the extent and location of cerebral steno-occlusive lesions, and with large artery atherosclerotic (LAA) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Korean patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed data prospectively collected over a 3-year period on consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on an angiographic study, a total of 1012 patients were classified into four subtypes: non-cerebral stenosis (n=654), intracranial stenosis (n=198), extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (n=86), and combined intracranial and extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (n=74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Independent associations of Lp(a) levels with the extent and location of cerebral stenosis were evaluated, and Lp(a) levels of subtypes by the TOAST criteria were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lp(a) levels of LAA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were significantly higher than those of the other four <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with more advanced intracranial (p=0.001) and extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> (p=0.001) tended to have higher Lp(a) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multiple regression analysis, the third Lp(a) quartile was the strongest risk factor for isolated intracranial (OR 3.36, 95% CI 1.77-6.37) or extracranial stenosis (OR 4.82, 95% CI 1.96-11.88), whereas the fourth Lp(a) quartile was the most powerful predictor for combined intracranial and extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (OR 4.98, 95% CI 1.92-12.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that greatly elevated Lp(a) levels are associated with LAA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and extensive burden of cervicocerebral steno-occlusive lesions, which might offer indirect evidence of proatherothrombogenic role of Lp(a) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
