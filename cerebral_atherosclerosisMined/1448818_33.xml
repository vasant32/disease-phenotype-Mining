<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The importance of the relation between asymptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> has been widely discussed, but there are few transversal and longitudinal studies on a general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A noninvasive examination was carried out using high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography, which has been shown to be a reliable tool for epidemiological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined 630 men and 718 women aged 18-99 years (participation rate, 74.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The global prevalence of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was 25.4% in men and 26.4% in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intimal-medial thickening was found in 9.4% of men and 11.7% of women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plaque prevalence was 13.3% in men and 13.4% in women; prevalence of stenotic plaques was 2.7% and 1.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjects aged &lt; or = 39 years showed a very low prevalence of any asymptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the multiple logistic regression, the analysis of subjects aged &gt; or = 40 years showed a positive significant association between the severity of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> (plaques and stenosis) and age (p &lt; 0.001), systolic blood pressure (p &lt; 0.01), cigarette smoking (p &lt; 0.0001), and the protective effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This analysis did not provide evidence of a clear-cut association between risk factors and intimal-medial thickening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This population study shows the high prevalence of asymptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> in a general population (approximately 25% of adults) and its relation with the classic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It emphasizes the value of ultrasonography in the detection of early <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
