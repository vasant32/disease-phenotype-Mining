<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular scintigraphy after re-injection of autologous 131I-labelled <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> was used to investigate early <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> visualized by sonography in the carotid arteries of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 10 male patients (4 smokers; mean age 56 +/- 8 years;) with early carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (mono- or bilateral; intima-media-thickness ranging from 1.5 to 3.5 mm) as shown by sonography were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these normolipemic patients suffered from primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and were treated with <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As controls 6 healthy male subjects (3 smokers; mean age 54 +/- 9 years;), with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> pattern were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hot spots appeared in the areas with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in 7 patients, while none were seen in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positive kinetic curves were observed in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences emerged in the target/non-target ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vascular <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> uptake in hypertensive patients is apparently late and rather limited; the uptake pattern may depend on plaque composition </plain></SENT>
