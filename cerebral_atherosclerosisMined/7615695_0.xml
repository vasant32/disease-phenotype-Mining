<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed data from 521 residents of the Yokufu-kai home for the aged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They underwent a 50 g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, and autopsies were done after they died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> functional evaluations were done retrospectively from the hospital records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was significantly higher in the overweight group than in the lean group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of marked cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was significantly higher in the overweight and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> groups than in the lean and the medium-weight groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> with neurological deficits was significantly higher in the overweight group than in the lean group, but there were no differences in other types of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0005145'>coronary artery stenosis</z:hpo> was significantly higher in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> group than in the lean and medium-weight groups, but there was no difference in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the incidence of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the aorta, femoral artery, or renal artery between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients in the overweight group were bedridden for a significantly longer time than those in the lean group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that body weight in the elderly is positively associated with survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, overweight subjects suffered from non-fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and prolonged survival was associated with greater disability </plain></SENT>
