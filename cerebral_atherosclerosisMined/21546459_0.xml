<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracranial angioplasty and stent placement are used to treat intracranial atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 2 interventions have not been directly compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single-center, single-operator registry of consecutive, symptomatic subjects receiving treatment (angioplasty, BMS, or WS, chosen based on safety as judged by the operator) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After November 2005, angioplasty alone was abandoned following the introduction of the WS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate per intervention at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The secondary end point was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate per patient beyond 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Success, dissection, restenosis, and occlusion rates were tracked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From April 2002 to January 2009, 140 subjects with 159 lesions (50%-100% stenosis) underwent 209 interventions: 89 angioplasty, 47 BMS, and 73 WS cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate at 30 days was 12.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The angioplasty arm had the lowest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate (4.5%), whereas the WS arm had the highest (24.7%; P = .0002), leaving the BMS with 10.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> rate beyond 30 days was 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The success rate was 58.4% for angioplasty, 81.3% for BMS, and 94.4% for WS, whereas the restenosis rates were 28.2%, 5.8%, and 13.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Dissection increased the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the first 30 days (P = .0439) and restenosis (P = .0051) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Perforator vessels were more likely than nonperforators to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within 30 days (P = .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Eccentric lesions were more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than concentric lesions (P = .0726) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this comparison, angioplasty had a significantly lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate than WS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Certain lesion locations, morphologic characteristics, and the presence of dissection after treatment were other predictors of unfavorable outcome </plain></SENT>
