<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The evaluation of plaque characteritics as well as the degree of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing is important in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several reports have shown that intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (IPH), which plays a pivotal role in plaque vulnerability, emits high signal intensity on T1-weighted images of high-resolution black-blood (BB) MRIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When an MRI is used to screen for vulnerable plaque, a short scanning duration and a simple MRI protocol are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the utility of screening BB-MRI to detect IPH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety-three consecutive cases with atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> scheduled for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting between January 2005 and December 2007 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High-resolution BB-MRI scans were obtained with 2D double-inversion recovery fast spin-echo sequences with cardiac gating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Screening BB-MRIs were performed with 3D gradient-echo sequences suppressing blood flow signals by radiofrequency wave spatial saturation over the scanning field of 3D time-of-flight MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relative overall plaque signal intensities with reference to the sternocleidomastoid muscle were calculated, and the correlation of intensities on T1-weighted images between high-resolution BB-MRI and screening BB-MRI was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We excluded 50 cases because of restenosis following CEA, use of a pacemaker, a long interval (&gt;10 days) between high-resolution and screening BB-MRI examinations, or poor-quality images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the 43 cases included, the relative overall plaque signal intensity of high-resolution BB-MRI and screening BB-MRI were closely correlated (r = 0.568, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Screening BB-MRI can be an alternative to high-resolution BB-MRI in the assessment of IPH and may be a useful tool for detection of vulnerable plaque </plain></SENT>
