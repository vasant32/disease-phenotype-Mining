<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated long-term outcome and prognostic predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in patients under 45 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three hundred thirty-three patients aged 15 to 44 years who suffered from a first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were prospectively followed up with annual clinical evaluation or complete phone interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>End points were the composite outcome event of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and vascular or nonvascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The probability of event-free survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate estimates of hazard ratios were calculated according to the Cox proportional hazards analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An average follow-up of 96 months was available in 330 patients (99.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival was worse in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at entry (86.5%) than in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (97.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality in both groups was significantly higher than in the general population (standardized mortality ratio [SMR] 14.5, P&lt;0.0001, Poisson distribution test, and SMR 7.9, P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average annual mortality rate was higher during the first (3.94%, 95% CI 1.84 to 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>04) than in the subsequent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The average annual incidence rate of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> at entry, and it declined from 1.56% (95% CI 0.21 to 2.91) during the first year to 0.06% (95% CI 0.04 to 0.08) at the end of the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial infarction</z:hpo> occurred later, after the first year, with similar rates in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> at entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The average annual rates of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (2.36%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (1.68%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (3.05%) were higher in patients with the mixed atherothrombotic and cardioembolic etiology than in the remaining patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Male gender, age &gt;35 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at entry, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e> were independent predictors of the composite outcome event at the Cox regression analysis, whereas only <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at entry and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e> predicted <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> in young adults have severe prognostic implications, because the mortality risk was highly increased with respect to the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Preventive measures are strongly recommended in the presence of any unfavorable prognostic profile </plain></SENT>
