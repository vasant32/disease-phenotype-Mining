<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, intracranial artery occlusive disease, especially middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) stenosis is more significant in Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The underlying mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with intracranial artery occlusive lesions is different from that of extracranial artery it is expected to recognize the pathogenesis and epidemiology of intracranial artery occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By digital magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and transcranial doppler (TCD) instead of traumatic subtract angiography methods for screening diagnosis of intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> that were developed in recent two decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In current paper, we summarized the results studied with MRA and TCD in Peking Union Medical College Hospital and Chinese University of Hong Kong with literatures reviews in this field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two aspects are discussed (1) Methods for diagnosis of intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>; (2) Epidemiology of intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
