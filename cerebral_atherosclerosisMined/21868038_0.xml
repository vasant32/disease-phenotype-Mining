<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the strength of the associations between adipocytokines and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> would differ between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 96 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients (within 5 days from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) and 48 non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subjects were analyzed in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> patients were comprised of 26 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> due to large artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (LAA) and 72 non-LAA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Venous blood from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants was drawn after an overnight fast, and serum levels of leptin, adiponectin and resistin were measured by multiple sandwich immunoassay techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with non-LAA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, patients with LAA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> had lower levels of serum adiponectin (6.4 ± 3.1 vs. 8.5 ± 3.9 μg/mL; P=0.04), and a higher level of leptin-to-adiponectin ratio (L:A ratio; 1.6 ± 1.4 vs. 0.9 ± 0.9; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multinomial logistic regression analyses showed that, although none of the adipocytokines was associated with non-LAA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, lower adiponectin (adjusted OR, 0.79 per 1-μg/mL increase; 95% CI, 0.64-0.98), higher leptin (aOR, 1.12 per 1-ng/mL increase; 95% CI, 1.004-1.25) and higher L:A ratio (aOR, 2.93 per 1-quartile increase; 95% CI, 1.39-6.15) showed significant associations with increased odds of having LAA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, compared to non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: From our study, we documented that leptin and adiponectin had differential association patterns with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> according to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Careful consideration of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes would be warranted in studying the utility of biomarkers including adipocytokines </plain></SENT>
