<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine whether internal border-zone infarction is associated with increased oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and a decrease in central <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> receptors (BZRs) in the overlying cerebral cortex in atherosclerotic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured the OEF by using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography and (15)O gas in 100 nondisabled patients with atherosclerotic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On MRI, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were categorized as territorial, border-zone (external or internal), deep perforator, and superior perforator <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 62 patients, BZRs were measured using (11)C-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5103">flumazenil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By using 3-dimensional stereotactic surface projections, the abnormally decreased BZR index ("BZR index") [(the extent of the pixels with Z score more than 2 compared with controls)x(average Z score in those pixels)] was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the hemisphere affected by <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease, the type of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was correlated with the value of OEF or BZR index in the cerebral cortex of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with patients without internal border-zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, those with these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (n=18) had significantly increased OEF and significantly high BZR index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that internal border-zone infarction was independently associated with increased OEF and high BZR index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In atherosclerotic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease, internal border-zone infarction is associated with increased OEF and a decrease in BZRs in the overlying cerebral cortex, suggesting that hemodynamic compromise may induce internal border-zone infarction and cortical neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
