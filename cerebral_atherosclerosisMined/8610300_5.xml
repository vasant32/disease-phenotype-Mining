<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The relation between symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>, silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 500 patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> admitted to the Downtown Barcelona <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Registry between July 1992 and December 1994, we evaluated prospectively the prevalence of silent infarction in 249 patients who had a brain MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The association of risk factors with silent infarction was investigated with the use of logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a selected group of 43 patients with symptomatic lacunes, we performed at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> follow-up transcranial Doppler sonography and 24-hour continuous blood pressure monitoring to evaluate whether blood pressure, cerebrovascular tone, and cerebral blood flow at rest and after the administration of 1 g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> correlated with silent infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 147 silent infarctions were observed in 83 patients (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most silent infarctions corresponded to small deep lesions in the territory of the lenticulostriate arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with silent infarctions had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, on multivariate analysis, age greater than 60 years was the only risk factor associated with silent infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup of 43 patients with symptomatic lacunes and patent extracranial vessels, systolic and diastolic pressure at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and diastolic pressure and vascular resistance at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> follow-up were higher when silent infarctions co-existed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, cerebral blood flow at rest and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> injection were unrelated to silent infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in patients with symptomatic lacunar and nonlacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was only associated with aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, a history of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was perhaps unrecognized, since hemodynamic testing and continuous blood pressure monitoring in patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> suggested that the coexistence of silent lesions indicated a more generalized cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878486" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriolosclerosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
