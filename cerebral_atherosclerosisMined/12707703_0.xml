<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using survival statistics,we studied the influence of various factors on the prognosis of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified 90 subjects with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis or occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signals were demonstrated in 33% and spontaneous flow variations in 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> findings normalized more quickly than asymptomatic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signals occurred only in symptomatic stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous flow variations strongly predicted the disappearance of a stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Atherogenic risk factors were associated with stable ultrasound findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that different types of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> findings exist: (1) dynamic, emboligenic stenoses or occlusions with early normalization and a high risk for ischemic events and (2) static, nonemboligenic stenoses with rare normalization and a low risk of ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A high percentage of the former may be of embolic origin, and the latter may be atherosclerotic plaques </plain></SENT>
