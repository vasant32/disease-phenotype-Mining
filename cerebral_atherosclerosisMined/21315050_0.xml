<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the expressional changes of soluble CD40 ligand(sCD40L) in peripheral blood serum and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>(APCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We selected ninety-nine patients getting APCI less than 7 d of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> as APCI group by prospective method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each 100 cases of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>(ACI) in the same and with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>(CAS) in the outpatient were respectively selected as ACI and CAS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expressional changes of sCD40L in peripheral blood serum and NF-κBp65 in PBMC of patients with CAS on admission, of patients with APCI and ACI when in hospital, on the course of seventh day, of fourteen and of thirtieth were detected respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression of sCD40L in peripheral blood serum and NF-κBp65 in PBMC of patients of ACI group on admission were obviously higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> than that of CAS group (P&lt;0.05); The expression of sCD40L in peripheral blood serum and NF-κBp65 in PBMC of patients of APCI group when in hospital, on the course of seventh day, of fourteen and of thirtieth were obviously higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> than that of ACI group (P&lt;0.05 ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The inflammatory and apoptotic mechanism mediated by expressional excessive increase of CD40-CD40L signal passage and NF-κB in PBMC might be one of the molecular biology mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and progress for APCI </plain></SENT>
