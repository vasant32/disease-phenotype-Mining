<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: T2-weighted MRI scans were performed in 39 control subjects, 61 subjects with NINCDS/ADRDA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and 60 subjects with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Deep white matter lesions (DWML) and periventricular lesions (PVL) were rated on a standard 0-3 scale by two radiologists blind to clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After controlling for differences in vascular risk factors and current blood pressure, DWML were significantly more common in depressed subjects and PVL in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> subjects compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DWML were most common in those presenting in late life with their first ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and 50% of such subjects had severe (grade 3) DWML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An association between DWML and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and PVL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> is supported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increase with DWML that occurs with ageing may predispose some elderly subjects to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
