<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although stent assisted angioplasty is an effective treatment for coronary and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo>, its efficacy in intracranial arteriosclerotic disease has not been verified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess the radiographic and clinical outcome of stent assisted angioplasty for symptomatic middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We attempted stent assisted angioplasty in 14 patients with symptomatic high grade stenosis (&gt;60%) on the proximal portion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, who had experienced either recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) resistant to medical therapy or one or more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient records were analysed for angiographic characteristics, degree of stenosis, pre-procedural regimen of anti-platelet and/or anti-coagulation agents, use of devices, procedure related complications, pre-operative and post-operative single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) findings, and clinical and radiographic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Stent assisted angioplasty was successfully performed in 8 of 14 patients without any serious complications and unsuccessful in 2 of 14 patients due to the tortuous curve of the internal carotid artery siphon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients had complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients had an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial rupture</z:e>; one patient was rescued by an additional stent and balloon tamponade, the other patient died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complications in the other two patients included thrombotic occlusion and distal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Residual stenosis was less than 50% in diameter in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eight patients who underwent follow up cerebral angiography had no restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow up SPECT showed improved perfusion in the affected <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the tested patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and in one of three <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Using the modified Rankin Scale at follow up, four of five <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients and five of six <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were assessed as functionally improved or having a stable clinical status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the re-stenosis rate in stent assisted angioplasty seems to be better than in primary balloon angioplasty as reported previously, the complication rate is still high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Elective stenting is an alternative therapeutic method for the prevention of secondary ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis, and seems to be a potentially effective but also hazardous therapeutic technique in patients with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This study indicates the need for randomised control trial data of this intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Additionally, long term follow up data and additional clinical experience are required to assess the durability of this procedure </plain></SENT>
