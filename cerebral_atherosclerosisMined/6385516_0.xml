<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By recording and evaluating these parameters and data patterns, coupled with clinical findings, differential conclusions on reactions of the cerebral hemodynamics in macrocirculatory and microcirculatory regions were realized in geriatric patients under the following pathophysiological and therapeutically induced conditions: Generally and regionally accentuated arteriosclerotic lesions of the brain (predominant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e>), decrease of flow velocities according to the diameter, aggravation by distress; principal possibility of pharmacological influence if myogenic autoregulation function is rehabilitable: It is demonstrated by the example of a long-term therapy with a combination of Raubasine, Dihydroergocristine and DHE (Defluina forte) </plain></SENT>
