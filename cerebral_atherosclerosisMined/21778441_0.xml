<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid and coronary arteries is accepted as a cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042560" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia, vertebral artery</z:e> ostium (VAO) atherosclerotic plaque is not widely recognized as a source of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We seek to demonstrate its implication in some posterior circulation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a nonrandomized, prospective, single-center registry on consecutive patients presenting with posterior circulation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> who underwent VAO stenting for significant atherosclerotic stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic evaluation and imaging studies determined the likelihood of this lesion as the symptom source (highly likely, probable, or highly unlikely) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 4 groups in decreasing order of severity of clinical presentation (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> then <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, asymptomatic), which were compared with the morphological and hemodynamic characteristics of the VAO plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up 1 year after stenting assessed symptom recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred fourteen patients underwent stenting of 127 lesions; 35% of the lesions were highly likely the source of symptoms, 53% were probable, and 12% were highly unlikely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentation correlated directly with plaque irregularity and presence of clot at the VAO, as did bilateral lesions and presence of tandem lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptom recurrence at 1 year was 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-five percent of the lesions were highly likely the source of the symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A direct relationship between some morphological/hemodynamic characteristics and the severity of clinical presentation was also found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, patients had a very low rate of symptom recurrence after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These 3 observations point strongly to VAO plaque as a potential source of some posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
