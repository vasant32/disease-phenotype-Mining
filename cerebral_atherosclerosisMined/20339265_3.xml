<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stenosis of the intracranial ICA is relatively uncommon, but the most common site is the cavernous portion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of the arterial wall structures were examined using serial 3-mm sections of 32 intracranial ICAs obtained from 50 cadavers to identify where the EEL disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The portions of the ICA where the intima exhibited thickening were also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both the internal elastic lamina (IEL) and EEL were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 32 specimens of the petrous portion of the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only the IEL was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 32 specimens of the intradural portion of the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The EEL had disappeared in 31 of the 32 specimens of the horizontal segment of the cavernous portion of the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intimal thickening of the ICA was observed in 23 of 32 ICA specimens, and frequently appeared in the horizontal segment of the cavernous portion of the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The EEL disappeared in the cavernous portion of the ICA, which is the most common site of stenosis of the intracranial ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Change in the elasticity of the arterial wall in the cavernous portion may be an important factor in the process of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the intracranial ICA </plain></SENT>
