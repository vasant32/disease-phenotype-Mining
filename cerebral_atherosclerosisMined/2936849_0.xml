<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In velocity imaging blood flow velocities are visualized with continuous wave or pulsed Doppler devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In pulsed echo-systems artery wall structures are visualized by picking up echoes reflected by the vessel walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Velocity imaging is mainly used to localize the site of velocity sampling which is of importance in screening the carotid artery bifurcation and in follow-up studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although promising results have been obtained in diagnosing <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> with echo-imaging systems, these systems have their limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To improve the diagnostic accuracy these systems should be combined with a single- or multi-gate pulsed Doppler system </plain></SENT>
