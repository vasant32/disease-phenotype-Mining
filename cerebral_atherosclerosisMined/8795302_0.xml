<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with carotid plaques undergoing carotid endarterectomy were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using intra-operative ultrasound three different levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> involvement of the arterial wall were defined: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arterial wall where <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> components (intima, media and adventitia) were clearly separated and intact; wall with intima-media thickening and fibrotic plaques (without calcifications); sections with diffusely calcified plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 20 patients 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sections, 20 sections with fibrotic plaques and 20 sections with large plaques and diffuse calcifications were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diabetic and hypertensive patients were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Wall flux was measured on the external surface of the common carotid artery before complete dissection for endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measurements were recorded when at least 3/4 of the adventitia was intact for a length of at least 4 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average flux in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sections was higher (p &lt; 0.05) than in sections with fibrotic plaques and in sections with calcified plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant difference in flux (p &lt; 0.05) between fibrotic (decreased flux) and calcified areas (very low flux) was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion a higher wall perfusion was observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arterial sections in comparison with sections with plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sections with diffuse calcifications and larger plaques had a very low flux </plain></SENT>
