<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the rate of anomalies of screening score in patients with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> were significantly higher than that of the control group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients and control scores were significantly different (P &lt; 0.05) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> items except the picture and face recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparing the screening score with brain CT scan, we found a relationship between brain damage and behavioural memory declination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, many persons of control group got low scores with behavioural memory test, suggesting that the Rivermead behavioural memory test be sensitive to memory declination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With its simplicity and sensitivity the Rivermead behavioural memory test may have some practical value in China </plain></SENT>
