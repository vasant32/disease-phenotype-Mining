<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 35 patients with SLE aged 37.67+/-9.96 and whose disease lasted 3.8+/-4.51 years, Doppler carotid ultrasonography was used to identify the presence of intima-media thickness or atherosclerotic plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain perfusion scintigraphy was done in 15 out of 35 patients in order to evaluate the dynamics in circulation through carotid and cerebral media arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measured by Doppler ultrasound, 2/35 of examined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> patients had a plaque and the 2/35 had an intimal-medial thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of perfusion scintigraphy in 15 examined patients out 35 with SLE showed that 5/15 had mild circulatory changes in carotidogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>4/15 patients had mild changes in cerebra media arteries circulation, 1/15 had severe changes in carotid circulation and 5/15 patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain scintigraphy finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some of the patients with SLE have atherosclerotic changes and only the early detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> may provide an opportunity for therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
