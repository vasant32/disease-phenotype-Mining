<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Clinically important atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease is mainly found in patients aged &gt;60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transcranial color-coded duplex ultrasonography (TCCD) is a relatively new technique for investigating the basal cerebral arteries; however, it is often hampered by impenetrable ultrasound windows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to ascertain the as yet unknown success rate of TCCD regarding visualization of the basal cerebral arteries in patients &gt;60 years, to provide reference data, and to compare any possible male/female differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 112 atherosclerotic white patients &gt;60 years of age, the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries and the vertebral and basilar arteries were insonated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In men, 99% of the temporal and 94% of the suboccipital windows could be penetrated by ultrasound compared with 77% and 95%, respectively, in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The male versus female vessel detection rates were 91% versus 58% for the anterior cerebral artery, 97% versus 73% for the middle cerebral artery, 97% versus 68% for the posterior cerebral artery, 94% versus 93% for the vertebral artery, and 91% versus 79% for the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 77% of men but only 33% of women could <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> vascular segments be investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> intracranial arteries were insonated at a deeper level in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The women showed significantly higher blood flow velocities than the men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In elderly white men the vessel detection rate is &gt;90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In women there is a much lower detection rate, due to impenetrable temporal windows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Visualization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> major intracranial arteries is possible in only one third of female patients &gt;60 years of age </plain></SENT>
