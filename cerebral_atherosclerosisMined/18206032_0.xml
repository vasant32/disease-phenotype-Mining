<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Carotid/aortocranial angiography and coronary angiography were performed in 34 CAD patients complicated with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 3 subgroups according to the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> determined by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 5 light, 4 moderate and 25 severe stenosis determined by coronary angiography and there were 6 light, 6 moderate and 24 severe stenosis determined by carotid/aortocranial angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005145'>coronary artery stenosis</z:hpo> was parallel to the carotid artery or vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients out of 25 patients with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242231" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary stenosis</z:e> had severe cerebrovascular stenosis (P = 0.873) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The coincident rate was as high as 92% for patients with moderate or severe cerebrovascular stenosis whose Califf risk scores of coronary artery were more than or equal to 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The follow-up study showed the incidence of cardiovascular event and cerebrovascular event increased significantly in the patients with moderate to severe coronary and cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>arteries stenosis</z:mp> and 3 patients with severe stenosis found in both coronary and cerebral arteries died during follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005145'>coronary artery stenosis</z:hpo> is parallel with carotid artery or vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
