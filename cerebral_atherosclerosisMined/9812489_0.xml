<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results showed that the major risk factors were high levels of serum TG, Lp(a) and BMI while serum level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> was the only protective factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When several levels were divided on Lp(a) and BMI, a significantly dose response relation was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Considering the correlation among serum concentration of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, we analysed the interaction of different factors, using Log-Linear models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results showed that there were significant interactions between arteriosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and TC, TG, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and Lp(a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were also interactions between TC, TG, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the strongest interaction is expected to happen at what level remains further investigations </plain></SENT>
