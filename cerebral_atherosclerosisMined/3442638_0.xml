<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pathological investigation has revealed that the occlusion develops due to fibrocellular thickening of the intima </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In spite of various studies, however, the etiology of this disease and the mechanism of the intimal thickening remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fibronectin (FN) is a high molecular weight <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> which is found in an insoluble form in many tissues and in a soluble form in plasma and other body fluids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FNs have many biological activities and play an important role in the formation of connective tissue under physiological and pathological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present study we have determined the plasma FN levels in order to investigate the relationship between FN and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The plasma FN levels were measured by the single radial immunodiffusion method using venous blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The plasma FN level in healthy subjects was 33.9 +/- 6.3 mg/dl (mean +/- standard deviation) which almost agreed with the level, 30-35 mg/dl, reported by some investigators </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Then the subjects were classified into a child group (15 years or younger) and an adult group (16 years or older) and their levels were examined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
