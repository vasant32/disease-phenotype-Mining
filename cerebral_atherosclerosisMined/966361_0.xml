<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo>, especially in the middle age group (30-59 of age), arteriosclerotic deviations in basal berebral arteries of the circle of Willis and intracerebral small arteries are not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> may occur without relationship to disturbances of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism, biochemically, and to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, pathologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concerning <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, especially in the old generation (over 60 years of age), severe arteriosclerotic deviations were recognized both in basal cerebral and intracerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These changes were highly influenced by the grade and duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and rarely influenced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to the above-mentioned facts, the results obtained from out epidemiological survey were confirmed by the pathological studies </plain></SENT>
