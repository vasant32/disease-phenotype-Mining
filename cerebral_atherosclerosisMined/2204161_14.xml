<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the ability of duplex scanning to predict plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> we compared different sonographic criteria (plaque border, plaque density, plaque structure) with the morphological findings in 169 consecutive carotid endarterectomies (144 cases with diameter reduction greater than 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two percent of the sonograms were inadequate, and 20% showed poor image quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regular plaque borders revealed a smooth or at most minimally ulcerated surface in 92% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Grossly ulcerated stenoses, however, were only found in 27% of the irregular plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the plaque border was nonvisible in 35% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simple, fibro-atheromatous plaques were found to be echogenic in 72% and echolucency was present in 80% of the stenoses with relevant intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, duplex scanning proved to be capable of detecting smooth, fibro-atheromatous stenoses with high accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ulcerations, however, cannot be predicted reliably, and intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> cannot be differentiated from atheromatous debris </plain></SENT>
