<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, human vasa vasorum associated with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> has not been adequately addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anterior and posterior circulation specimens from fresh autopsy material were studied under the magnification of a dissecting microscope and proliferative vasa vasorum was found to be frequently associated with intrinsic atheromatous plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vasa vasorum associated with an incidental large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> supports the radiological literature demonstrating that many large and giant thick-walled <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> exhibit vascularized walls on contrast computed tomography scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This information may aid in the preoperative assessment and possible repair of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
