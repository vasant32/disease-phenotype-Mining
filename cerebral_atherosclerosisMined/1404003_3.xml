<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various self-report questionnaires have been introduced to measure alexithymia, but only a few rigorous validity studies of this concept have been carried out in nonclinical populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS) in a population sample of 1560 middle-aged men from eastern Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The modified version of the TAS applied in this study had a factor structure that matched the previous results and the theoretical concept of alexithymia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Internal consistency of the total TAS scale, as well as the 8 month retest reliability, were adequate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The TAS correlated fairly well with an interview-based evaluation of alexithymic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the TAS could be a useful screening instrument for alexithymic features in a population study, but the scale would probably need some revisions </plain></SENT>
