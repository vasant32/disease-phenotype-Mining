<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, current imaging techniques are of limited utility in the diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the use of 3-Tesla (3T) high-resolution moderate T2-weighted imaging (HRT2WI) to detect <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> plaques in three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> perforator territory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> plaques were seen with HRT2WI in a patient with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis, which was observed by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the two patients without <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis (also confirmed by MRA), one had thin <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> plaques and the other had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> walls based on HRT2WI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progression of symptoms occurred in the patients with plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that 3T HRT2WI can identify plaque on <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> walls and has the potential to identify patients at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> progression or recurrence </plain></SENT>
