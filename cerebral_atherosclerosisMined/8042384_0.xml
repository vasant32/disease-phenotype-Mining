<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pentoxifylline enhances circulation primarily in the stenotic vessels, while nicergoline in the intact cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The former is more potent in inducing antiaggregation inhibiting spontaneous platelet and red cell aggregation and reducing blood viscosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of the study suggest better response in case of pentoxifylline treatment of patients with hypo- and eukinetic circulation, while in nicergoline treatment hyperkinetic hemodynamics patients benefit more in view of the drug cardiodepressive activity </plain></SENT>
