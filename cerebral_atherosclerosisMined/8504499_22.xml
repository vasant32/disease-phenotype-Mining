<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of aspirin on the initial stages of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients were recruited from a prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial to compare two doses of aspirin (900 mg versus 50 mg daily) with regard to restenoses after lower limb angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 383 patients admitted to the angioplasty trial, 27 patients with 104 small carotid atheroma (&lt; 50% lumen narrowing) were examined at entry and after 1 year of aspirin treatment with the use of a high-resolution ultrasound duplex system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disease progression and regression were defined by a change of maximal plaque area (as measured by longitudinal ultrasound sections) of more than 2 SDs of the method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The change in plaque area was significantly different for the treatment groups: Average plaque size remained unchanged after treatment with 900 mg aspirin daily but increased markedly after treatment with 50 mg aspirin daily (p = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were significantly more lesions in the 50-mg group showing progression than in the 900-mg group (23 plaques [47%] versus 13 plaques [24%], p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonic disappearance of a lesion was observed only in the 900-mg group in nine cases (seven soft plaques and two ulcerative plaques, p = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The six patients on 50 mg aspirin who continued smoking during the study showed significantly more progression compared with the seven nonsmokers in the 50-mg group (17 plaques [59%] versus six plaques [30%], p = 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study indicate that aspirin treatment slows carotid plaque growth in a dose-dependent fashion, with a dose of 900 mg daily more efficient than 50 mg daily </plain></SENT>
