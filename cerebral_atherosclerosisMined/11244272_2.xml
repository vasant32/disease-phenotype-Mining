<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Past studies were conducted with different methodological approaches, sometimes leading to opposing conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the weight of alcohol intake on carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in a group of subjects asymptomatic for cardio-cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were examined by ultrasonographic assessment during the period 1993 through 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Common risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and drinking habit were assessed by a standardized questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this survey we confirm the J-shaped relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of alcohol intake is more evident if we consider the presence of multiple internal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, or those greater than 25%, as outcome variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These effects are independent from the other risk factors included in logistic regression paradigms (age, arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, family history of cardio-cerebrovascular disease, smoking and social status) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study supported that a high level of alcohol intake plays a role as an independent factor in carotid atherogenesis </plain></SENT>
