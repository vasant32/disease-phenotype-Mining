<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unilateral bruit was associated with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> compared with no bruit (p less than or equal to 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there was no association between laterality of the bruit and the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (p = 0.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was marginal evidence that patients with bilateral bruits had more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> than patients with unilateral bruit (p = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relation between bruit and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> categorized by B-mode ultrasound was not sufficient to reliably predict the presence or absence of disease in an individual patient, though the presence of a bruit should be viewed as a risk factor for, or an indicator of, increased risk of systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
