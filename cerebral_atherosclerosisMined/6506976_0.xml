<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The findings obtained demonstrate that the clinical picture in these patients is always characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbances</z:hpo> which decrease the level of their diurnal wakefulness and their capacity for work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic disturbances responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0852564" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sleep disorders</z:e> are in turn maintained by the latter which leads to the formation of the vicious circle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is also supported by the fact that compromized cerebral circulation causes changes in the activity of the structures involved both in sleep-wakefulness function and the regulation of the cerebral and systemic hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hence, deviations in the nocturnal sleep pattern attended with pronounced alterations in the cerebral hemodynamics may contribute to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> disorders of the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors recommend correcting not only the disrupted structure of sleep but also the cerebral circulation with relation to he sleep-wakefulness cycle </plain></SENT>
