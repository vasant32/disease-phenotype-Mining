<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our experiments was to clarify the relationship between the susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and chemical composition in the human cerebral, coronary arteries and aorta, and the concentration and composition of human arterial intimal elastic tissues were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the cerebral arteries, the concentration of hot alkali-insoluble elastin was higher than that of the coronary arteries and aortas, and gradually decreased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age-related changes of the elastin in the coronary arteries were quite small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The total polar amino acids and crude ash contents of arterial elastins were affected by age and treatment of elastic tissue wheteher or not EDTA-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_48'>decalcification</z:mpath> was applied prior to alkali-extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in the amino acid composition of elastin was founded between the cerebral, coronary and aortic intimas and no significant changes to elastin, and or collagen, which can explain the slow development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the cerebral artery, were founded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, from these results, the slower development rate of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, as compared with other arteries, can not be sufficiently concluded </plain></SENT>
