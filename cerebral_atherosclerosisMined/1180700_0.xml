<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The investigation of atherosclerotic changes in every vessel of the base of the brain showed that in the so-called posterior trifurcations there was a statistically reliable growth of the average degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the intracranial region of the inner carotid artery ensuring in these cases the blood supply for a considerably greater region of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In posterior connective arteries atherosclerotic changes were revealed only when their diametre exceeded 0.1 cm which testified to the bloodflow in these arteries </plain></SENT>
