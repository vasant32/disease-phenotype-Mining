<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report describes the selection process for participating surgeons in the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Surgical Management Committee established guidelines for minimal annual experience and maximum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological morbidity</z:e> and mortality for surgeons to qualify to participate in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For approval, a surgeon must perform at least 12 carotid endarterectomies per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on a review of the surgeon's last 50 consecutive endarterectomies, the combined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological morbidity</z:e> and mortality rate must be no greater than 5% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> indications and no greater than 3% for endarterectomies performed on asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred sixty-four surgeons from 48 centers applied for approval: 117 were approved, 17 were rejected, and 30 were not reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 117 approved surgeons submitted a total of 5,641 endarterectomies with a combined mortality and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological morbidity</z:e> rate of 2.3% for the variety of indications for operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This overall experience with carotid endarterectomy is one of the largest series reported to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data from approved surgeons are well within the range of acceptable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological morbidity</z:e> and mortality rates recommended by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Council of the American Heart Association, which attests to the overall quality of the surgeons participating in the study </plain></SENT>
