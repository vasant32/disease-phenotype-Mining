<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Otologic-audiologic examination was carried out in 75 patients (between 42 and 86 years of age; average age: 65 years) with confirmed internal angiologic obliteration of the carotid artery, either unilateral or bilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 51 unilateral and 24 bilateral stenoses/occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diseases of the ear were excluded clinically and audiologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>- The mean hearing loss shows a sensorineural high tone loss in the tone audiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The range of scatter of high tone loss increases proportionally to the increase of frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>- Compared with the physiological examination of geriatric patients, the total word comprehension and especially the minimal discrimination loss point towards a pathologic impairment of hearing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total word comprehension amounts to 250.79% in the 51-60 age group, 237.79% in the 61-70 age group, 175.83% in persons aged 71-80 years, and 118.33% for those over 80 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The minimal discrimination loss comprises 5.83% in the 51-60 age group, 9.79% in the 61-70 age group, 22.50% in patients between 71 and 80 years, and 48.00% in those over 80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>- No connection between the extent of loss of hearing and the stage of obliteration of the carotid artery can be shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the decompensation of total word comprehension and especially the minimal discrimination loss is a very important sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>- These findings contribute towards a differentiation of physiologic and pathologic hearing diseases in old age with particulas reference to the underlying arteriosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
