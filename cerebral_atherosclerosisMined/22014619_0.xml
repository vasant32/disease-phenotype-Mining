<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six participants from the Barcelona-Asymptomatic Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (AsIA) neuropsychology study were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were 50-65 years old, free from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and without history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed correlations of blood levels of inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein [CRP] and resistin) and fibrinolysis inhibitors (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [PAI-1] and A-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (Lp (a)) with fractional anisotropy (FA) measurements of diffusion tensor images (DTI), regional gray matter (GM) volumes and performance in several cognitive domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increasing levels of C-reactive protein and PAI-1 levels were associated with white matter (WM) integrity loss in corticosubcortical pathways and association fibers of frontal and temporal lobes, independently of age, sex and vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PAI-1 was also related to lower speed and visuomotor/coordination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the biomarkers were related to gray matter volume changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and dysregulation of the fibrynolitic system may be involved in the pathological mechanisms underlying the WM damage seen in cerebrovascular disease and subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
