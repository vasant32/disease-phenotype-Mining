<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39027">very-low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> fraction increased cholesterol concentrations were found, and the mean value of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density-lipoprotein</z:chebi> (H.D.L.) cholesterol in I.C.D. patients was 18% lower than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since a low H.D.L.-cholesterol concentration has been suggested as an independent strong risk factor, it is possible that the susceptibility of I.C.D. patients to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is the result of a low H.D.L. rather than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020476" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipoproteinaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
