<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sonograms were adequate in 87 (85%) vessels and angiograms were adequate on at least one view in 86 (84%) vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An adequate image was obtained by one or the other method in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two vessels (98%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although most vessels were seen well on one view only on DSA, agreement with sonography was exact in 73% of compared vessels and acceptable in 96% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no difference was found in the rate of agreement with sonography for vessels seen well by DSA on two or more views compared with those seen well on one view only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that DSA and sonography are comparable screening methods for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> and that a suboptimal study by either can usually be compensated for by performance of the other </plain></SENT>
