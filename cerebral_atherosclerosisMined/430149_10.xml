<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had occlusive disease of the internal carotid artery (ICA), and one patient had severe stenosis of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before anastomosis, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography showed slow filling of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branches through collateral channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal areas of impaired microcirculatory filling and washout were seen in the territory of severely sclerotic cortical arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings of preanastomotic 133Xe clearance studies were variable and a uniform pattern of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes was not defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 55% of the patients, rCBF was reduced to 25 ml/100 gm/min or less at one or more detector sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">Fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography provided an immediate assessment of anastomotic patency and clearly displayed the distribution of blood entering the epicerebral circulation through the STA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 67% of patients, multiple <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> cortical branches filled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>, whereas in 33% filling was restricted to the receptor artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An immediate, substantial (greater than or equal to 15 ml/100 gm/min) increase in rCBF was demonstrated in 73% of patients after anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rCBF changes were consistently better in patients with donor and receptor arteries greater than 1 mm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Redistribution of collateral input acted to increase rCBF in areas distant from the anastomotic site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some improvement in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> circulation and rCBF also was seen in cortex supplied by sclerotic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branches </plain></SENT>
