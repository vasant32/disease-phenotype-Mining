<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A comparative pathological study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> was conducted between the deep white matter (M1) and the subcortical white matter (M2) to investigate the difference in the arteriolar changes in normally-aging individuals and those presenting vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The arterioles (20-100 microns in outer diameter) of 95 autopsied brains were examined (56 control cases; C group, 24 hypertensive cases; HT group, and 15 Binswanger type vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> cases; VD group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In C group, the primary pathological change was adventitial proliferation (AP), which was significantly more pronounced in M1 than in M2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AP in M1 was found to have advanced promptly with aging, while AP in M2 advanced mildly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AP in M1 was much more pronounced in HT group than in the age-matched C group, but little difference in M2 was observed between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AP in VD group was more pronounced in M2 than in M1 compared with HT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that AP in M1 occurs prior to that in M2 in the process of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging, and that AP, in M2 as well as in M1, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger</z:e> type vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
