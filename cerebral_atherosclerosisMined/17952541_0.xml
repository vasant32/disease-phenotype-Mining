<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Intracranial arterial wall calcifications are frequently observed on routine head computed tomography (CT) images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether calcification of the intracranial carotid artery on CT images could predict atheromatous plaque and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 259 patients were examined using three-dimensional CT angiography using high-resolution 64 detector scanners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined patients from the petrous portion to the top of the internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the existence of calcification and atheromatous plaque based on our criteria retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The thickness of calcification was measured in each vessel, and the shape of calcification was classified into three types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was low correlation between the thickness of the calcification and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> stenosis, but the shape of the calcification corresponded well to the stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The population of patients with &gt;50% stenosis of the intracranial carotid artery differed statistically significantly for each calcification shape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a high negative predictive value (97.7%) in the correlation between the existence of calcification and atheromatous plaque on the multidetector CT images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Calcification of the intracranial carotid artery on CT images shows a high negative predictive value for the existence of atheromatous plaque in the same artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The thickness of the calcification did not correlate well with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> stenosis, but its shape seemed to predict <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
