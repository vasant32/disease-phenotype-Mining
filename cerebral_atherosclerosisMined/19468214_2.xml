<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Intracranial intra-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003207'>arterial calcifications</z:hpo> (ICAC) are a common finding on head CT examinations, but their significance is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to determine if a relationship exists between ICAC on head CT and the presence of a high-grade atherosclerotic stenosis on cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 108 consecutive patients admitted to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> service at Parkland Hospital in Dallas, Tex., USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each patient had undergone a head CT and catheter-based angiographic study to meet the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic information was recorded along with CT imaging data in regards to the amount of calcification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiographic images were reviewed independently, and a comparison was made to determine if calcification was predictive of finding a high-grade stenosis on angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 108 consecutive patients with a mean age of 56 +/- 12 years were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 540 vessels studied, 65 (12%) were found to have a stenosis of &gt;or=50% on angiography, and 71 (13.1%) were found to have a calcium grade of 3 or 4 on head CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ICAC appeared to be more common in the anterior circulation compared to the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with grade 3 or 4 calcification of an intracranial vessel on head CT were more likely to have a stenosis of &gt;or=50% on cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of ICAC on head CT appears to correlate with the presence of an underlying intracranial stenosis on angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further study is required to validate these preliminary findings </plain></SENT>
