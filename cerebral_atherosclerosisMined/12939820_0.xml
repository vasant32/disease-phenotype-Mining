<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In our studies an attempt was undertaken to establish whether there is a relationship between total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> fraction concentrations and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> receptors expression on monocytes in various clinical types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and in subjects without clinical manifestations of this disease before and after 40 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study included 77 subjects divided into 4 groups: I--after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, II--after cerebral ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, III--with obliterative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002635'>atheromatosis</z:hpo> of the lower limbs, and control group IV without clinical symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002635'>atheromatosis</z:hpo>: a) subjects below 40 years of age b) over 40 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Receptor expression on monocytes was tested with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> Receptor Test (Orpegen Pharma, Heidelberg, Germany) using flow fluorometry method (FAC Scan, Backton Dickinson, San Jose, USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The value of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> receptors expression was calculated based on the difference of mean fluorescence intensity of monocytes incubated in low-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> (LPDS) and autologous sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that particular types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002635'>atheromatosis</z:hpo> vary in the value of total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> fraction concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The highest concentrations of these <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> fractions were observes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> and only in this group they correlated with the value of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> receptors expression on monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This observation suggests that various clinical types of atheromathosis may differ pathogenically and lesions in the vessels may be the consequence of cholesterol transport defect or of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> molecule modification; they not necessarily depend on the value of absolute <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> concentration in blood </plain></SENT>
