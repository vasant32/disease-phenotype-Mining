<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether poststroke changes in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles would affect the prognosis of symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a substudy of Trial of cilOstazol in Symptomatic intracranial Stenosis 2 (TOSS-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From 10 centers we enrolled 230 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> symptomatic stenosis in the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery or basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At baseline and 7 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, subjects underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiogram and assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> including <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progression of intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis was determined by comparing stenosis on the baseline and follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cilostazol treatment was more frequently seen in the nonprogression group (109 of 198 [55.1%]) than in the progression group (11 of 32 [34.4%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 7 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> when compared with baseline, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> and total cholesterol levels decreased in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, only nonprogressors showed increase in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> levels between baseline and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I levels were not different between the groups, although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B/A-I at 7 months was higher in progressors than in nonprogressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Remnant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50404">lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> levels decreased in nonprogressors, whereas they did not change in progressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analyses, after adjusting for cilostazol treatment and remnant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50404">lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> reduction or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B/A-I at 7 months, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> elevation remained as a significant predictor for the nonprogression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospective multicenter study to demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> elevation, along with remnant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50404">lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> reduction and low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B/A-I, is associated with prevention of angiographic progression of symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis </plain></SENT>
