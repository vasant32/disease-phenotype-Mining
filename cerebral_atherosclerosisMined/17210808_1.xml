<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Prior observations have shown that early recurrent ischemic lesions (ERILs) on diffusion-weighted imaging occur frequently within the first week after an index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate differential patterns of ERILs among <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes, particularly intracranial large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (IC-LAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: We included 133 patients who experienced an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and who underwent initial diffusion-weighted imaging within 24 hours and subsequent diffusion-weighted imaging within 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype was IC-LAA, extracranial LAA (EC-LAA), or cardioembolism (CE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Early recurrent ischemic lesions were defined as new ischemic lesions on follow-up diffusion-weighted imaging, separate from the index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Early recurrent ischemic lesions were observed in the following proportions: 50.9% (28/55) in the IC-LAA group, 47.4% (9/19) in the EC-LAA group, and 44.1% (26/59) in the CE group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early recurrent ischemic lesions in the IC-LAA group had the following characteristics: (1) they occurred mostly (27 [96.4%] of 28) in the pial area of the same vascular territory as the index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; (2) they were more frequently observed in a higher grade of stenosis than in milder stenosis (P&lt;.001), whereas ERILs in the EC-LAA group were not related to the degree of stenosis; (3) they were not associated with subsequent recanalization, whereas ERILs in the CE group were mostly associated with subsequent recanalization (P&lt;.001); and (4) they were more closely associated with clinical recurrence than in the EC-LAA or CE group (P=.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early recurrent ischemic lesions in the IC-LAA group are relatively frequent and have different patterns than in the EC-LAA or CE group </plain></SENT>
