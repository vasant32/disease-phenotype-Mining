<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data were collected prospectively from 2007 to 2009 in a multicenter cohort of patients undergoing interventions for cervicocerebral stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Retrospective assessment of the 2003-2006 archives of the same interventionists and a review of their published work is the second part of this national survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 592 extracranial internal carotid artery angioplasty and stenting procedures in 581 patients (73% male; mean age, 63.4 + or - 7 years), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in 1.7%, 1.7%, 0.34%, and 1.52%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 114 extracranial vertebral artery angioplasty and stenting procedures in 110 patients (68% male; mean age, 65.3 + or - 6 years), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> each developed in 1 (0.92%) patient, but there was no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 70 intracranial angioplasty and stenting procedures in 67 patients (76% male; mean age, 68.5 + or - 8 years), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were observed in 1.4%, 8.6%, 1.4%, and 2.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of periprocedural complications in angioplasty and stenting of cervicocerebral arteries by our neurointerventionists was similar to that in developed countries </plain></SENT>
