<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The transcranial Doppler sonographic findings of 61 patients with middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) disease were compared with those of 535 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to computed tomographic, angiographic, and/or autopsy findings, the patients were classified as having <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusive lesions in the central (sphenoidal) part or in peripheral branches or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> lesions, the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> flow velocity (FV) was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the same time the anterior cerebral artery FV increased because of collateral flow over leptomeningeal anastomoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Central <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> lesions showed less marked changes than did peripheral lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis a steep rise of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> FV appeared inside the stenotic segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If there was a high-grade stenosis or occlusion of the internal carotid artery, a collateral circulation over the anterior part of the circle of Willis was seen in addition to the changes caused by the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From these hemodynamic changes, transcranial Doppler sonographic diagnostic criteria for <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusive and stenotic lesions were established </plain></SENT>
