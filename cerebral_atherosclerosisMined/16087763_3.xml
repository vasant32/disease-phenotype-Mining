<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The DWI characteristics of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> and atherosclerotic disease have not been reported in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the DWI <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patterns in patients with posterior circulation occlusive disease to determine mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patterns in patients with symptomatic vertebrobasilar disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Large community-based teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients admitted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to vertebrobasilar disease were identified retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were included if DWI was obtained within 7 days of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> patterns were analyzed according to established templates of vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven patients with vertebral dissection and 39 patients with atherothrombosis were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An AMBI pattern was present in 8 (72%) of 11 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissections</z:hpo> and 25 (64%) of 39 patients with atherosclerotic disease (P = .48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Distal embolism to the terminal branches of the basilar artery occurred with equal frequency in both groups and was found in half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarction</z:e> did not occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pontine infarction was noted in 2 (18%) of 11 patients with dissections and 18 (46%) of 39 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (P = .09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Cerebellar border zone involvement was found in 14 (36%) of 39 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and 4 (37%) of 11 patients with dissections (P = .6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> is frequently associated with AMBI in the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The incidence of AMBI was comparable to that reported in the anterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This DWI study supports the importance of embolism as the main mechanism of infarction in patients with vertebrobasilar occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>On the basis of our experience, large-vessel vertebrobasilar disease rarely causes isolated small-vessel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
