<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: Two independent post-approval registries have reported favorable periprocedural and short term outcomes with the use of the Wingspan stent for treatment of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data on long term clinical and imaging outcomes after Wingspan stent placement are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients treated with the Wingspan stent in a single academic center from January 2006 to February 2008 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on stenting indication, severity of stenosis, technical success, re-stenosis and clinical outcome were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 51 patients were treated with the Wingspan stent system for a symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis of 50-99% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The technical success rate was 98% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean pre- and post-stent stenoses were 73 (11)% and 21 (7)% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 24 h of the procedure occurred in 1/51 (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 30 days or ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> beyond 30 days was 5/51 (10.0%) at a mean follow-up time of 14.6 months (range 8-30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of ≥ 50% re-stenosis on follow-up imaging was 7/29 (24%) at 8.6 (4.4) months (range 3-20); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were detected on the initial imaging within 3-6 months, and only one was symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of the Wingspan stent in patients with ≥50% symptomatic intracranial stenosis is associated with good long term clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred after the first 30 days, suggesting a significant stabilization of the adverse event rate after the first month </plain></SENT>
