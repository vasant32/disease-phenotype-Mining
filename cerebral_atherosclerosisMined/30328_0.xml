<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With age a number of changes occurred, which were characterized by a decrease in specific and non-specific immunity, against the background of which the autoimmune reactions were developing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was an increase in the frequency of the detection of antibodies to antigens of the brain as well as in those of the aorta, heart, liver and pancreatic gland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The "peak" of autoimmune reactions was registered at 65 years in men and 75 years in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, which together with homologic antigens inhibited the migration of macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In subjects aged 90 years and over the autoantibodies occurred in a lower percent of cases as compared with the subjects aged 60--74 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In subjects aged 45--55 with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> the indices under study appeared to be close to those in healthy persons aged 60--74 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Still more marked immunological shifts were found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings may suggest a certain role of the autoimmune mechanisms in pathogenesis of some forms of <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> pathology at late stages of ontogenesis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
