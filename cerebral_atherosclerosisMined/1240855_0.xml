<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Chromosome examinations in 40 (16 males and 24 females) aged subjects were compared with those of 30 (15 males and 15 females) young subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For the aged, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available data gathered from detailed medical examinations and laboratory findings were reviewed to exclude persons who were classified as with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029221" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">organic brain syndrome</z:e> was based on psychiatric evaluation and the score on the Graham-Kendall Memory-For-Designs test was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These two assesssments have been used as the basis for the comparison between mental functioning and chromosomal changes (<z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of peripheral leukocytes which showed loss of one or more chromosomes (hypodiploid cells) was not substantially larger among the aged than among the young men; yet aged men showed a significant loss of G-group chromosomes (including the Y chromosome) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, a significantly higher proportion of hypodiploid cells was for the elderly women when compared with young women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most of the missing chromosomes belonged to the C-group chromosomes (including the X chromosomes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, an excess of hypodiploid cells among the aged females who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029221" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">organic brain syndrome</z:e> was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A similar association was demonstrated between hypodiploidy and the score on the Memory-For-Designs test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For the aged males, however, there was no remarkable relationship between frequency of hypodiploid cells and either diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029221" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">organic brain syndrome</z:e> or Graham-Kendall score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the data provide confirmation for an association between mental status and chromosome loss at least with aged females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Possible explanations were made on the above discrepancy appeared between sexes as well as on biological and genetic factors between mental functioning and chromosomal changes in the process of aging </plain></SENT>
