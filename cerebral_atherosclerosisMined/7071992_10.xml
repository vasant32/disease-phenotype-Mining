<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goals of this work are to devise and improve techniques for estimating the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> at the carotid artery bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Features are automatically extracted from spectrum analyzed Doppler blood flow data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five statistical pattern recognition algorithms are compared, with cross validation being used to improve the estimate of classification accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A data collection protocol has been devised in which four sites are studied along each carotid arterial system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Classification of unknowns is done using a hierarchy of three decisions </plain></SENT>
