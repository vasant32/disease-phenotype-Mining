<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To retrospectively evaluate the cerebrovascular complications from elective stent placement for symptomatic intracranial stenosis and to explore preliminarily which factors are associated with complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional ethics committee approval was obtained, with waiver of informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Records were reviewed of 181 consecutive elective stent placement procedures in 169 patients (mean age, 51.8 years; 142 male and 27 female patients) with symptomatic intracranial stenosis of more than 50% diameter reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complications were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fisher exact or chi(2) tests were used to assess statistical differences between rates for discrete variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stratification analysis was used to assess the significant relationship (P &lt; .05) between a potential risk factor and a complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complications occurred in 20 patients (11.8%) of 169 patients: Ten patients (5.9%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (four patients had symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhages</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICHs</z:e>], and two of these patients died; six patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six patients had target-lesion <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> for which intrathrombus thrombolysis resulted in early complete patency without sequelae, two had asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICHs</z:e>, one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, and one had asymptomatic dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Perioperative noncompliance with antiplatelet therapy was found to be significantly associated with target-lesion <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (two of eight patients [noncompliance] vs four of 161 patients [compliance], P = .027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stratification analysis revealed a significant correlation between the use of double stents for a lesion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> (P = .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cerebrovascular complications from elective stent placement for intracranial stenosis are diverse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of double stents for a lesion is an independent risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Perioperative noncompliance with antiplatelet therapy is associated with a higher frequency of target-lesion <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
