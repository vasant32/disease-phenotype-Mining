<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We targeted implications of adipokines in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were examined (n=145) and the results were compared with the control group (n=68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have examined potential associations between leptin, adiponectin and ghrelin, and different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and traditional risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly higher levels of leptin and lower levels of adiponectin and ghrelin were confirmed in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of leptin in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was three-times higher than in men, and the leptin levels positively correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ghrelin levels correlated mildly with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels, and were dominant in men with cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin levels were not different between men and women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and correlated with atherothrombotic and lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> types in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adipokines and ghrelin play an important role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, but their function in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes seems to be different and sex influenced </plain></SENT>
