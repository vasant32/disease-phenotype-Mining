<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In Caucasian patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) due to symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenoses (ICAS), only limited data on the recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate and its associated risk factors have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In view of the increasing options for endovascular interventions, we sought to investigate the prevalence, risk for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and mortality in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 304 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> due to 50-99% ICAS were prospectively documented in 19 German <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 201 patients (68.1% of the survivors), a central biannual telephone follow-up could assess recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and mortality up to a median of 2 years after the index event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An ischemic cerebrovascular event attributable to symptomatic ICAS was found in 2.24% of the consecutively admitted patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall cumulative recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate after admission was 17.9% (95% CI = 13.4-23.5) for the first year and 23.3% (95% CI = 17.8-29.8) over 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After correction for age and sex, only previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (HR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.14-3.91) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HR = 2.41, 95% CI = 1.33-4.37) were significantly associated with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the prevalence of this etiology seems very low in patients admitted to German <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> centers, we found a high risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with symptomatic ICAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether endovascular interventions can reduce this high risk needs to be determined in a randomized trial </plain></SENT>
