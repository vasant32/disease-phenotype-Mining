<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the expression of Fn14 and its ligand TWEAK in carotid atherosclerotic plaques and its potential modulation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we have studied whether proinflammatory cytokines regulate Fn14 expression in human aortic smooth muscle cells (hASMCs) in culture as well as the potential regulation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fn14 and TWEAK expression was analyzed in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Fn14 expression was studied in hASMCs in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fn14 and TWEAK are expressed in macrophages and smooth muscle cells in carotid atherosclerotic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1beta and interferon-gamma) upregulate Fn14 expression in hASMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This effect was prevented by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> treatment and reversed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25350">mevalonate</z:chebi> and geranylgeranyl <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">pyrophosphate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor, toxin B (Rac and Rho inhibitor), C3 exoenzyme (Rho inhibitor), and Y-27632 (Rho kinase inhibitor) also decreased Fn14 expression, implicating the Rho/Rho kinase pathway in the regulation of Fn14 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> treatment reduced Fn14 expression in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TWEAK and Fn14 are expressed in atherosclerotic plaques and could be novel mediators of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">Atorvastatin</z:chebi> diminishes Fn14 expression in vitro and in vivo providing novel information of the beneficial properties of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
