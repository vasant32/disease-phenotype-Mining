<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the temporal pattern of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in a series of 1253 Greek first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients revealed a circadian distribution with two incidence peaks between 08.00 and 10.00 h, and between 16.00 and 18.00 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Considering the different etiopathogenic types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the same two-peak time pattern was evaluated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subgroups with the only exception of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which seems to predominantly occur during night and sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> peak in the late afternoon has not been previously described in such detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A relation between the second, however lower, frequency peak and the traditional Greek habit of afternoon sleep (siesta) could be assumed and deserves further investigation </plain></SENT>
