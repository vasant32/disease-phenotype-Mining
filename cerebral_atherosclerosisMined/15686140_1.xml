<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Measurements were made of plasma levels of free (f) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30660">thyroxine</z:chebi> (fT4), triiodothyronine (fT3), thyrotropic hormone (TSH), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi>, and renin in patients with dyscirculatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (DE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their influences on the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> circulatory insufficiency were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 39 patients were studied (aged 45-73 years) with DE stages I and II, without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (in the exacerbation phase) somatic illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These observations showed that diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lesions of brain</z:e> tissues of different severities were accompanied by the following changes in thyroid homeostasis: 1) significant combined increases in TSH without alteration to the "fT3-TSH" negative feedback regulatory mechanism in patients with stage I DE; 2) significant combined decreases in TSH levels with marked suppression of the conversion of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30660">thyroxine</z:chebi> into triiodothyronine and an interaction with impairments in the "fT3-hypophysis" system in patients with stage II DE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, there were changes (increases) in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> levels with simultaneous decreases in renin levels in patients with stage II DE as compared with patients with stage I DE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlation analysis demonstrated the absence of any relationship between the age of the patients, the state of hormonal homeostasis, and the extent of <z:mp ids='MP_0005412'>vascular stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a role for hormones of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal-adrenal, thyroid, and renin-angiotensin systems in the mechanism by which DE develops as well as the possibility of using tests for these hormones as additional criteria for assessing the severity of diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
