<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26195">polyphenol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">catechin</z:chebi> would prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e>, maintain CBF responses, and protect learning abilities in atherosclerotic (ATX) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We treated ATX (C57Bl/6-LDLR(-/-)hApoB(+/+); 3 mo old) mice with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">catechin</z:chebi> (30 mg · kg(-1) · day(-1)) for 3 mo, and C57Bl/6 [<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (WT), 3 and 6 mo old] mice were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>- and flow-mediated dilations (FMD) were recorded in pressurized cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basal CBF and increases in CBF induced by whisker stimulation were measured by optical coherence tomography and Doppler, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Learning capacities were evaluated with the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with 6-mo-old WT mice, cerebral arteries from 6-mo-old ATX mice displayed a higher myogenic tone, lower responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> and FMD, and were insensitive to NOS inhibition (P &lt; 0.05), suggesting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Basal and increases in CBF were lower in 6-mo-old ATX than WT mice (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A decline in the learning capabilities was also observed in ATX mice (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">Catechin</z:chebi> 1) reduced cerebral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> staining (P &lt; 0.05) in ATX mice, 2) restored endothelial function by reducing myogenic tone, improving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>- and FMD and restoring the sensitivity to nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase inhibition (P &lt; 0.05), 3) increased the changes in CBF during stimulation but not basal CBF, and 4) prevented the decline in learning abilities (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">catechin</z:chebi> treatment of ATX mice prevents cerebrovascular dysfunctions and the associated decline in learning capacities </plain></SENT>
