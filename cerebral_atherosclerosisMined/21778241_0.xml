<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The WASID study established the risk of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> at 1 year in subjects with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (70%-99%) at 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of different methods of endovascular revascularization in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention still has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate in our registry at 1 year following intervention with the WASID results to identify which method, if any, provides the most benefit in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This result from the BMC-IRR follows a previously published article comparing stent placement and angioplasty outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We maintained a nonrandomized single-center single-operator registry of consecutive symptomatic patients who underwent endovascular intracranial revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were collected prospectively and retrospectively and analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with angioplasty, BMS, or self-expanding WS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To make our data comparable with that in the WASID study, we selected patients with a single lesion of 50%-99% stenosis undergoing a single intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Data was collected on patients until symptom recurrence, repeat intervention, or 1 year postintervention, whichever occurred first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that 115 patients fit the inclusion criteria, with 38 angioplasty, 28 BMS, and 49 WS cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For patients with 70%-99% stenosis, the overall probability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at 1 year postintervention was 19.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> probability per device, independent of clinical presentation, was 12.5% for angioplasty, 20.2% for BMS, and 24.1% for WS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the WASID data, angioplasty appears to have a lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate after 1 year than medical therapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, neither stent-placement arm compared favorably with the WASID results </plain></SENT>
