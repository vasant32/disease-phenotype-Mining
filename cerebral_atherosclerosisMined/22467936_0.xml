<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: (1) To describe a series of adults assessed for suspected primary <z:mp ids='MP_0001864'>angiitis</z:mp> of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (PACNS) and their final diagnosis; (2) to describe and compare presenting features of PACNS and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS); and (3) to evaluate the specificity of the presenting features of RCVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients evaluated at our institution between 2000 and 2008 for a possible <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and investigated by conventional angiography and/or brain biopsy were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The inclusion criteria were a clinicoradiological presentation and cerebral angiography and/or brain biopsy raising the hypothesis of isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005318'>cerebral vasculitis</z:hpo>; and absence of identifiable etiology at the time of conventional angiogram and/or brain biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 58 cases evaluated, 37 met the inclusion criteria and 33 were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients had RCVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thunderclap <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, the absence of a focal neurological deficit, a convexal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and/or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain parenchyma on magnetic resonance imaging, and "string of beads" appearance on conventional angiography had high diagnostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients had other noninflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disorders</z:e> (intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, cryptogenic embolism, and genetic vasculopathy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight patients were diagnosed with PACNS; their clinical presentation and disease course were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Brain biopsy was performed in 3 cases (positive in 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RCVS is an important differential diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Its particular presentation should allow rapid identification in order to avoid pointless investigations and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The frequent lack of histological proof and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> presentation of PACNS illustrated the nosological uncertainties of this label </plain></SENT>
