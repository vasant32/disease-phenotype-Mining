<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular pathways involved in the development of ICAD from its asymptomatic stages are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our population-based study, we aimed to compare the risk factor and biomarker profiles associated with intracranial and extracranial asymptomatic cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Asymptomatic Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (AsIA) study cohort includes a random sample population of 933 white subjects &gt;50 years with a moderate to high vascular risk (based on REGICOR score) and without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (64% males; mean age, 66 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carotid and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were screened by cervical and transcranial color-coded Duplex ultrasound, being moderate to severe stenoses confirmed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We registered clinical and anthropometric data and created a biobank with blood samples at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A panel of biomarkers involved in atherothrombogenesis was determined: C-reactive protein, asymmetric-dimethylarginine, resistin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> was quantified by Homeostasis Model Assessment index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After multinomial regression analyses, male sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, smoking, and alcoholic habits were independent risk factors of isolated extracranial atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> conferred a higher risk for ICAD than for extracranial atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> were independent risk factors of moderate to severe ICAD but were not risk factors of moderate to severe extracranial atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Regarding biomarkers, asymmetric-dimethylarginine was independently associated with isolated ICAD and resistin with combined ICAD-extracranial atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show distinct clinical and biological profiles in subclinical ICAD and extracranial atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> emerged as an important molecular pathway involved in the development of ICAD from its asymptomatic stage </plain></SENT>
