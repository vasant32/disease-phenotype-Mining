<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It has been reported that the D allele of an insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) gene is associated with conditions of increased cardiovascular risk, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Considering that a genetically determined overactivity of the renin-angiotensin system may influence cardiac as well as vascular growth, we investigated possible relations between ACE I/D genotype and carotid artery wall thickness (B-mode ultrasound) in 199 subjects, 50 to 64 years old, sampled from the general population of Vobarno, a small town in northern Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ACE DD genotype was associated with significantly higher common carotid artery intima-media thickness (P = .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of carotid atherosclerotic plaques was similar in the different genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no association of the ACE I/D genotype with blood pressure values (either casual of 24-hour ambulatory monitored) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ACE DD genotype may be considered a risk factor for the development of common carotid intima-media thickening in our study population </plain></SENT>
