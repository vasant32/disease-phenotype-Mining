<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> has been suggested to be common in Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We apply a semi-quantitative CT scoring system to evaluate the degree of intracranial atherosclerotic calcification and determine its distribution, severity, and the associated risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcome of these patients after a 3-year follow-up was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty consecutive patients diagnosed clinically to have either a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) or minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and underwent early computed tomographic angiography (CTA) were included into the prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two radiologists evaluated the axial CTA images for any calcification in the precavernous, cavernous and postcavernous segments of intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA), anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral as well as vertebrobasilar arteries, based on a standard CT scoring system for extent (0-4) and thickness (0-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The composite CT score for extent and thickness of these vascular segments or vessels were recorded for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The worst site (highest composite score) was chosen as the marker of the degree of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients were then classified into mild, moderate, and severe groups, according to a composite CT score of 0-2, 3-5, and 6-8, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings were gathered with clinical parameters and outcome after a 3-year follow-up period and corresponding statistical analyses were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most severely affected vessel was found to be intracranial internal carotid arteries, and severe, moderate, and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were present in 16 (26.67%), 30 (50%), and 14 (23.33%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using multiple logistic regression analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (odds ratio = 10.6, P value = .004), and age (odds ratio = 1.07, P value = .02) were found to be significant risk factors for severe intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients in the severe group, 3 patients in the moderate group, and 1 patient in the mild group were found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> after a 3-year follow-up, but there was no significant difference among the 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Significant intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> as determined by severe CT calcification was common in a cohort of Chinese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were independent significant risk factors, and this CT calcification score might serve as an early indicator of intracranial atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
