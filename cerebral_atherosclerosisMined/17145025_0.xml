<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHOD: Prospective protocolized study of 269 consecutive patients younger than 70, attended because of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> of any territory -53% coronary (CHD), 32% cerebrovascular (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>), 15% peripheral (PVD)- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent evaluation of risk factors and their control, systematic non-invasive study of the vascular tree (Doppler-ultrasound) and comparison between groups according to the index territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Even though <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> risk factors were represented in the 3 groups, male sex, smoking and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were more frequent in PVD and dyslipemia was more common in CHD (p &lt; 0.05) Abdominal aortic diameter and carotid intima-media thickness were similar for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, while the number of carotid plaques was higher in PVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CHD patients more often presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> and reduced ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PVD patients showed a marked reduction of the ankle-brachial index as well as increased C-reactive protein and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe unsuspected vascular lesions were found in 13% of cases (95% confidence interval, 9.5-17.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk factor control was better for CHD, followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and PVD, but was globally poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The systematic evaluation of the vascular tree detects generalized <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp>, in some cases severe and clinically unsuspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>New markers to identify patients at very high risk are necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>Peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> identifies a group of patients of particular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Risk factor control is deficient, particularly among PVD patients </plain></SENT>
