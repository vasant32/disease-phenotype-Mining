<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The left common carotid arteries of male <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (apoE)-deficient mice (9 weeks old) were ligated just proximal to their bifurcations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 4 weeks on a standard diet, the mice received <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53226,53227">polyethylene</z:chebi> cuff placement just proximal to the ligated site, and the animals were then processed for morphological studies at specific time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ligation of the carotid artery in apoE-deficient mice for 4 weeks induced marked intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, which is a <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>- and collagen-rich lesion that contains a number of macrophages, T lymphocytes, and smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the cuff placement evoked intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and plaque rupture with fibrin(ogen)-positive <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in this region accompanying a decrease in collagen content as well as an increase in apoptotic cells in the intima within a few days after cuff placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the murine model of human plaque rupture, which is simple, fast, and highly efficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This model would help us not only to understand the mechanism of human plaque rupture but also to assess various already-known and as-yet-unknown agents in the future </plain></SENT>
