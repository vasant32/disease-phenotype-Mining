<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The etiologic diagnosis of intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> is sometimes challenging because of the dynamic nature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether short-term follow-up vascular imaging adds additional information to the differential diagnosis between intracranial atherosclerotic and embolic occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with symptomatic middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (MRA) within 24h of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up MRA was performed 5-7days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> subtypes were independently determined at baseline and follow-up MRAs based on clinical, laboratory and imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the 108 included patients, the most common etiologic subtype of initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was intracranial large artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (ICLAA) in 70 patients, followed by cardioembolism in 29 and other causes in 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On follow-up MRA, 32 (29.6%) patients showed either significant or complete recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, 10 had been originally diagnosed with ICLAA, but were reclassified as a cryptogenic mechanism after follow-up MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of coexisting arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR], 6.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.67-17.91; p&lt;0.001); the absence of large territorial infarction (OR, 4.06; 95% CI, 1.39-11.85; p=0.010); and smoking (OR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.028-6.29; p=0.043) were significantly associated with a final diagnosis of ICLAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the absence of follow-up vascular imaging, a substantial proportion of patients with intracranial middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> may be misdiagnosed as ICLAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of early dynamic changes in intracranial middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> may provide useful information for the differential diagnosis of intrinsic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and embolic occlusion </plain></SENT>
