<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A light microscopy study on the localization of enzyme activity within atherosclerotic human intracranial arteries was performed on autopsy material obtained within 4 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The data suggests that the atherosclerotic process first goes through a proliferative phase and then a degenerative phase culminating in the formation of a plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the proliferative phase, smooth muscle cell proliferation has formed a thickened intima </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tetrazolium reductase, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> triphosphatase (ATPase) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> monophosphatase (AMPase) activities are present in these cells, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dehydrogenases and acid phosphatase activities were weak or not present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As the degenerative phase commences, an area of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and macrophage accumulation is formed on the lumen side of the elastica </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This area increases in size until a plaque is formed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unsaturated polar and nonpolar <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>, cholesterol, alpha-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24346">glycerophosphate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase, acid phosphatase, and AMPase activities are associated with these areas and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003651'>foam cells</z:hpo>, which are often found in the thickened intima of the proliferative phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tetrazolium reductase and ATPase activities decrease in the thickened intima as the area of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> increases in size, while dehydrogenase activity, except that for alpha-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24346">glycerophosphate</z:chebi>, remains low or not present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patterns of enzyme alterations for various stages of the disease process in intracranial arteries, the aorta and coronary arteries suggest a similar, if not identical, progression of the atherosclerotic process, irrespective of known differences in the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
