<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated biomarker values to determine if they are related to cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> with consideration of CAB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively recruited patients with noncardioembolic ischemic cerebrovascular disease who had no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient-based vascular assessment was conducted using MRA for the cerebral arteries and cardiac CT angiography for the coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biomarkers including the C-reactive protein and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 178 patients were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was associated with the highest quartile of C-reactive protein (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.04-4.55), whereas age was the only predictor of the highest quartile of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, with consideration of CAB, CAB (≥2 segments with ≥50% stenosis) remained the only independent predictor for the highest quartile of C-reactive protein (OR, 8.69; 95% CI, 2.41-31.30) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (OR, 11.44; 95% CI, 2.61-50.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data emphasize the importance of CAB in biomarker studies of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
