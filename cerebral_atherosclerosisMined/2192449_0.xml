<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such studies, however, are based on the results obtained by experienced investigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify whether sonographic criteria can be standardized, 6 investigators from different hospitals each documented 30 carotid artery stenoses of greater than or equal to 40% diameter reduction which could be imaged in at least 2 planes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three sonographic criteria (plaque surface, echo density, echo structure), each with 8 categories, were assessed from the image documentations by the 6 as well as by 2 independent further investigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Depending on the experience and on the device used 29-81% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stenoses greater than or equal to 40% examined in the different laboratories could be included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The +/- 1 category concordance between the different investigators averaged 50-60% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sonographic criteria independent from the degree of stenosis and from the image quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because of lack of sufficient reproducibility the subjective assessment of sonographic criteria is found to be not suitable for use in multicentre studies </plain></SENT>
