<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She died when she was 58 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On gross examination the brain showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>enlarged ventricles</z:hpo> and arteriosclerotic changes of large extracerebral vessels of the circulus arteriosus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microscopic examination of the atrophic brain showed innumerable incomplete microinfarcts in the white and gray matter throughout <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parts of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the white matter these lesions were characterized by small foci of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> and loss of oligodendrocytes while occasionally some scavenger cells were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Axons seemed to be unaffected or displayed irregular axonal regeneratory growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Any inflammatory reaction failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the cerebral cortex and subcortical nuclei the lesions showed loss of neurons and decrease in synaptophysin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intracerebral arteries showed <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> or fibrohyalinosis of the entire intracerebral small-vessel network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, numerous uncommon clusters of <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp>-like telangiectatic vessels were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Medium-sized ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were found in the right putamen and adjacent internal capsule region, left-side dorsolateral brain stem and cerebellar hemisphere as well as a left-side pyramidal tract degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Contralateral pseudohypertrophy of the inferior olivary nucleus was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The clinical and the neuropathologic observations made in this patient are compatible with small vessel disease characterized by a multicentric special and not yet described type of incomplete mini-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in cerebral cortex and white matter accompanied by some larger ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of the common type in brain stem and cerebellum </plain></SENT>
