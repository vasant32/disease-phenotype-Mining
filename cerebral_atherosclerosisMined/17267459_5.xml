<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the predictive value of total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (tHcy), <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="27306">vitamin B6</z:chebi> on the long-term occurrence of coronary and cerebral atherothrombotic events in a nested case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Within a cohort of 1021 healthy subjects (490 men and 531 women) recruited in 1987, 66 first-ever coronary and 43 first-ever cerebrovascular events were recorded at a 12-year follow-up (cases, n=109) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 109 control subjects (remaining free from events) were matched with cases according to age, sex, smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e>, and body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum samples obtained in 1987 at baseline were used to measure tHcy, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamins B12</z:chebi> and B6, as well as C-reactive protein plasma concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found a significant graded association between tHcy levels and the risk of coronary and cerebrovascular events [odds ratio (OR) for uppermost vs. lowermost quartile=1.34, 95% CI 1.01-1.76)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">Folate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> did not significantly differ between cases and controls, but were negatively (P&lt;0.01) correlated with tHcy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="14" ids="27306">Vitamin B6</z:chebi> did not correlate with tHcy levels, but differed significantly between cases and controls: for subjects in the uppermost quartile vs. the lowermost quartile of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="27306">vitamin B6</z:chebi>, OR=0.69 (95% CI 0.49-0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For subjects in the lowermost quartile of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="27306">vitamin B6</z:chebi> and the uppermost quartile of tHcy, OR=17.50 (95% CI 1.97, 155.59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cases and controls were not different as to C-reactive protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: tHcy and plasma <z:chebi fb="14" ids="27306">vitamin B6</z:chebi> are long-term independent risk factors for coronary and cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
