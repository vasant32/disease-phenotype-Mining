<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: About one in five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> have significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e>, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> are cardioembolic in origin in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We investigated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> sub-types based mainly on clinical, carotid ultrasonographic, and neuroimaging findings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with non-valvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (NVAF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was classified as definite or probable cardioembolic, possible lacunar, or possible atherothrombotic, as proposed by Hart et al. and the TOAST criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical features and risk factors (gender, age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption) were designated as clinical variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and six of 1938 patients (5.5%) had NVAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with and without NVAF, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> was more common in patients without NVAF (p&lt;0.001), while the prevalence of other risk factors was not statistically different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the TOAST criteria, none of the patients with NVAF could be classified as having had an atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to the classification by Hart et al., of the patients with NVAF, 49 patients (46.3%) had a definite embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 17 (16.0%) had a probable embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 12 (11.3%) had a possible atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 17 (16.0%) had a possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>, and 11 (10.4%) had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of undetermined etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Besides the presence of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.001), none of the variables related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were different among the sub-groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> were more likely to develop atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, while other risk factors associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> failed to point to an etiologic cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It should also be emphasized that the conventional classification system failed to aid in the correct diagnosis and risk stratification in patients with multiple confounding risk factors </plain></SENT>
