<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to identify some <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase proteins with possible role in the pathogenesis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase proteins were prospectively investigated by standard methods in sera of 78 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the first admission day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were two groups according to neurological deficit one month after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>: good outcome and poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second group mean value of C-reactive protein (CRP) was 0.122 +/- 0.06 g/l (p &lt; 0.01), mean value of C3 was 2.61 +/- 0.36 g/l (p &lt; 0.01), mean value of C4 was 0.73 +/- 0.07 g/l (p &lt; 0.05), mean value of alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT) was 4.9 +/- 0.46 g/l (p &lt; 0.01), mean value of alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) was 0.33 +/- 0.04 g/l (p &lt; 0.01), mean value of alpha 1-acid <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (AGA) was 1.12 +/- 0.15 g/l, (p &lt; 0.05), mean value of fibrinogen was 2.6 +/- 0.22 g/l (p &lt; 0.01), mean value of haptoglobin was 2.8 +/- 0.33 g/l, (p &lt; 0.05), mean value of transferrin was 2.8 +/- 0.26 g/l (p &lt; 0.05), mean value of ferritin was 238 +/- 22.42 microg/l (p &lt; 0.001), mean value of fibronectin was 2.14 +/- 0.17 g/l (p &lt; 0.05), mean value of ceruloplasmin was 1.23 +/- 0.24 g/l (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High significant values of ferritine and significant values of CRP, C3, AAT, ACT and fibrinogen were observed in patients with poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presented data suggest that the studied markers are useful to appreciate the role of the inflammatory reaction in the atherothrombotic pathogenesis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
