<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sought to evaluate the natural history and prognosis of patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease who received medical therapy versus percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Charts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease from July 2004 to September 2007 were reviewed and assessed for history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were either treated with "best medical therapy" (Medical Therapy Group) or PTAS plus antiplatelet agents (PTAS Group) and followed prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A favorable outcome was defined as the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; modified Rankin Scale of &lt; or =3; and no endovascular reintervention of symptomatic in-stent restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred eleven patients fulfilled entry criteria, with 58 (52.3%) and 53 patients (47.7%) enrolled in the Medical Therapy and PTAS Groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight patients of the Medical Therapy Group (65.5%) had a favorable outcome compared with 37 patients of the PTAS Group (69.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combined ischemic end point data for the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was similar with 14 (24%) events in the Medical Therapy Group versus 15 (28.3%) events in the PTAS Group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the combined ischemic end point was the same in the Medical Therapy and PTAS Groups </plain></SENT>
