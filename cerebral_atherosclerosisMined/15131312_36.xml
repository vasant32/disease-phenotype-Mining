<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients with 42 symptomatic M1 stenoses refractory to medical therapy were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lesions were situated at M1 trunk (n=13), M1 origin (n=12), and M1 bifurcation (n=17), respectively, which were classified into type N (nonbifurcation lesions, n=13) and type A (prebifurcation, n=11), B (postbifurcation, n=14), C (lesion across the nonstenotic ostium of its branch, n=1), D (across the stenotic ostium of its branch, n=2), F (combinative lesions of prebifurcation and its small branch ostium, n=1) locations, morphologically into type A (n=15), B (n=23) and C (n=4) lesions, and into type I (mild-to-moderate tortuosity and smooth access, n=17), II (severe tortuosity and/or irregular arterial wall, n=18), and III (excessively severe tortuosity, n=7) accesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The technical successful rate was 97.6% for total lesions and 100%, 100%, and 85.7% for types I, II, and III accesses, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total complication rate was 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mortality was 2.5% (1/40 patients), and 0%, 0%, and 25% for types A, B, and C lesions, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the median 10 months follow-up, there was no recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 38 available patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 8 stenting vessels of seven patients with six-month follow-up angiography, 7 showed good patency and one showed restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stenting appears to be an effective and feasible therapy for symptomatic M1 stenoses, but also appears to have the higher periprocedural complications, which need strict procedural and periprocedural management to reduce the mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The LMA classification seems to be helpful to work out the individual therapy and predict the results of stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A further study is needed to confirm the benefits of stenting of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
