<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to determine the relationships among vascular smooth muscle function, endothelial function, and initiation and processing speed in this sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants were 80 individuals with AVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Resistance vessel function was measured before and after infusion of vasoactive agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological assessment included measures of estimated premorbid cognitive function, current global cognitive function, initiation, and processing speed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vascular smooth muscle function was significantly associated with the initiation/processing speed composite score [R-Square Change = .152; F Change (1,71) = 16.61; p &lt; .001], above and beyond the variance accounted for by age, education, premorbid cognitive function, and endothelium-dependent vascular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This relationship remained significant when controlling for current level of global cognitive functioning and 10 vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endothelium-dependent vascular function was not significantly associated with test performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Decreased vascular smooth muscle function in forearm resistance vessels was significantly associated with relatively poor initiation and processing speed in individuals with AVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With additional research, measures of vascular function might become useful in the early identification of those individuals at greatest risk for vascular-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
