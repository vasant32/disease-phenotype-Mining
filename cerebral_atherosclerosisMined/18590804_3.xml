<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have recently reported the presence of relationship between HindIII, PvuII, Ser447Ter (C--&gt;G) polymorphisms of LPL and ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We first studied the relationship between LPL polymorphisms and the risk of atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (CI) by detecting the frequencies of LPL HindIII, PvuII and Ser447Ter genotypes and combined genotypes in the Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited 185 CI patients, confirmed by cranial computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging/angiography, or both, and 186 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms technique was used to detect HindIII, PvuII and Ser447Ter polymorphisms of the LPL gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequencies of the H+H+ genotype and H+ allele did not differ between CI and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of the P+P+ genotype and P+ allele gene were significantly higher in the CI group (P=0.040, P=0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of CG+GG genotype and G allele were lower in the CI group (P&lt;0.001, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the CI group, the individuals with P+P+ genotype had a significantly higher level of plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (TG) and a lower level of plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CG+GG genotypes were correlated with significantly higher levels of plasma total cholesterol (TC), <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-c and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-c) in the CI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of H+/C and P+/C combined genotypes were higher in the CI group than in controls (P&lt;0.001, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The frequency of H+/P+/C combined genotype was significantly higher in the CI group than in controls (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that PvuII and Ser447Ter polymorphisms are associated with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile and CI </plain></SENT>
