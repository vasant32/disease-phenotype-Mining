<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, only a few large-scale population studies have been performed to investigate the association between serum calcium and carotid plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed on the subjects who underwent general health screening tests including ultrasonographic evaluation of the carotid artery between 1994 and 2000 at our institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before the statistical analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> serum calcium values were adjusted for the serum albumin concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 5,732 subjects enrolled in the present study, 3,785 were male and 1,947 were female, and were aged 22-88 years (median 57 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carotid plaque was identified in 1,313 (23%) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum calcium concentration was slightly greater in the subjects with plaque than in those without (2.28 +/- 0.8 vs 2.27 +/- 0.7 mmol/l, p &lt; 0.001; unpaired t-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis including confounding risk factors revealed that serum calcium is an independent positive predictor for carotid plaque with an odds ratio of 1.70 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.50-1.92] for each increase of 1 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Male and female subjects in the highest quartiles of serum calcium concentrations had a greater risk of carotid plaque with odds ratios of 1.52 (95% CI 1.35-1.71, p &lt; 0.01) and 1.57 (95% CI 1.27-1.92, p &lt; 0.05), respectively, compared to the subjects in the lowest quartiles of calcium concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that serum calcium is an independent risk factor for carotid plaque </plain></SENT>
