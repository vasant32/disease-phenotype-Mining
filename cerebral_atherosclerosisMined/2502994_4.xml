<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycan</z:chebi> (GAG) content of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and atherosclerotic areas of cerebral arterial tissue isolated from human males was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main trunk and distal branches of the arteries were obtained at autopsy on 12-89-year-old Japanese subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The GAG components were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after enzymatic digestion, using specific GAG lyases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both total GAGs and water content were lower in the diseased arteries than those in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the reverse was noted for the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main GAG component of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral arteries was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26820,35175">sulfates</z:chebi> (HS), comprising half the total GAGs, followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18376">dermatan sulfate</z:chebi> (DS) and chondroitin 6-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> (Ch-6S) constituting 1/5 to 1/9 the total GAGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chondroitin 4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> (Ch-4S) comprised approx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>1/10 the total GAGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Oversulfated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37397">chondroitin sulfate</z:chebi> isomers were detected as novel peaks of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37397">chondroitin sulfate</z:chebi> types G, B, E and H on HPLC analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Small amounts of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16336">hyaluronic acid</z:chebi> (HA) and chondroitin were also detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The total GAG content decreased with severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The content and proportions of HS to the total GAGs decreased remarkably, and those of Ch-4S, HA and chondroitin showed a moderate decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The reverse was the case for those of DS, Ch-6S and oversulfated DS and/or Ch-S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> components, in particular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17002">cholesterol ester</z:chebi>, in the diseased tissue were significantly greater than in the visibly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> parts while the opposite was the case for the water content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thus, the GAG species and their contents in human cerebral arteries showed a characteristic distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>As oversulfated DS and Ch-S isomers have <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and anti-atherosclerotic activities, they may play a pertinent role in the disease process </plain></SENT>
