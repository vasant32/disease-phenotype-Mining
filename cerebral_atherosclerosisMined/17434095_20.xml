<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with large artery occlusive disease (LAOD) have a distinct pathophysiology and may respond differently to anticoagulation treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the efficacy of a low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH), nadroparin calcium, with aspirin in Asian <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with LAOD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms less than 48 h and LAOD (diagnosed by transcranial doppler imaging, carotid duplex scan, or magnetic resonance angiography) were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly assigned to receive either subcutaneous nadroparin calcium 3800 anti-factor Xa IU/0.4 mL twice daily or oral aspirin 160 mg daily for 10 days, and then <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> received aspirin 80-300 mg once daily for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study is registered at www.strokecenter.org/trials (number 493) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Among 603 patients recruited, 353 (180 LMWH, 173 aspirin) had LAOD (300 had intracranial LAOD only, 42 had both intracranial and extracranial disease, and 11 had extracranial disease only) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients with good outcomes at 6 months (Barthel index &gt;or=85) was 73% in the LMWH group and 69% in the aspirin group (absolute risk reduction 4%; 95% CI -5 to 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of prespecified secondary outcome measures showed a benefit in outcome for LMWH versus aspirin on the modified Rankin scale dichotomised at 0-1 (odds ratio 1.55, 95% CI 1.02-2.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Haemorrhagic transformation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and severe adverse events were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Post-hoc analyses of patients without LAOD, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treated patients, showed similar proportions with a good outcome in aspirin and LMWH groups (78%vs 79% and 73%vs 75%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Overall, the results do not support a significant benefit of LMWH over aspirin in patients with LAOD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The benefits indicated in most outcome measures warrant further investigation into the use of anticoagulation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with large artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, particularly in intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
