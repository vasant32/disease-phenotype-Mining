<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebral microbleeds are focal deposits of hemosiderin that can be visualized with MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known on their prevalence in the general population and on their etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that, in analogy to spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, the etiology of microbleeds differs according to their location in the brain, with lobar microbleeds being caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> and deep or infratentorial microbleeds resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the prevalence of and risk factors for microbleeds in the general population aged 60 years and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study is based on 1,062 persons (mean age 69.6 years) from the population-based Rotterdam Scan Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI was performed at 1.5 T and included a sequence optimized to increase the conspicuity of microbleeds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We assessed the relation of APOE genotype, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, and markers of small vessel disease to the presence and location of microbleeds with multiple logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall prevalence of cerebral microbleeds was high and increased with age from 17.8% in persons aged 60-69 years to 38.3% in those over 80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>APOE epsilon 4 carriers had significantly more often strictly lobar microbleeds than noncarriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and presence of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and white matter lesions were associated with microbleeds in a deep or infratentorial location but not in a lobar location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of cerebral microbleeds is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data support the hypothesis that strictly lobar microbleeds are related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo>, whereas microbleeds in a deep or infratentorial location result from hypertensive or atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
