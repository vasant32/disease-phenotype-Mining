<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 103 atherothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (ACI) patients, 85 lacunar infarction (LI) patients, 70 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) patients, and 86 healthy controls, plasma resistin and insulin levels were measured by ELISA, SNPs in resistin gene 5' flanking region were detected by PCR and direct DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects' body height and weight, the body mass index, quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), blood pressure, and the concentration of fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> were also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: QUICKI was significantly lower in the ACI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> patients (0.316 +/- 0.037 and 0.309 +/- 0.032, respectively) than that in the controls (0.342 +/- 0.043, P &lt; 0.001), while plasma resistin level was significantly higher in the ACI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> patients (6.36 +/- 3.79 and 7.15 +/- 4.27 ng/mL, respectively) than that in the controls (5.28 +/- 2.56 ng/mL, P &lt; 0.05), but such difference was not observed in the LI patients compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically negative correlation between plasma resistin level with QUICKI (r = -0.228, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distributions of allele and genotype frequencies of resistin gene - 420C &gt; G and - 537A &gt; C SNPs were not significantly different among the different groups, and those SNPs were not correlated with other clinical and biochemical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Plasma resistin is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by participating in the development of IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SNPs in resistin gene 5' flanking region has no impact on the plasma resistin level </plain></SENT>
