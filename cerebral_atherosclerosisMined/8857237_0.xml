<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lp(a) concentration was measured using a single radial immunodiffusion method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because Lp(a) showed a skewed distribution, Lp(a) was plotted in each group on a box plot and analyzed using non-parametric methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following results were obtained: 1) Lp(a) levels were significantly higher in both the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> groups than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2) The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> group was divided into 4 groups: [1] <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (HEM); [2] cardioembolic infarction (EMB); [3] <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (LAC); and [4] atherothrombotic infarction (THR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the THR group, Lp(a) concentration was higher than those in the control and LAC groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3) In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> group, patients with an elevated Lp(a) value showed severe lesions in the major cerebral arteries evaluated by cerebral arteriograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>4) In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> patients who underwent coronary angiography, the Lp(a) level showed a marked increase with an increase in the number of affected vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The correlation between coronary index (CI) and Lp(a) was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lesion severity of coronary arteries was correlated with serum Lp(a) concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a high Lp(a) value is linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the cerebral and coronary arteries, and influences its severity </plain></SENT>
