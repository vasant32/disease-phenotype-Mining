<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was verified clinically as well as by computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vision was tested and the visual field, intraocular pressure, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arteriovenous passage time, arm-retina time, and erythrocyte flow velocity in the conjunctival capillaries were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> determined; ophthalmoscopy was also carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microcirculatory parameters were obtained from 21 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant disturbances of the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arteriovenous passage time were observed, but there were no significant disturbances of the conjunctival erythrocyte flow velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concurrently measured haemorheological parameters were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pathological with the exception of the haematocrit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed arteriosclerotic alterations in 38 of 40 patients </plain></SENT>
