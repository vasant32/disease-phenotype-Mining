<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Atherothrombotic disease of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) frequently occurs in Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This abnormality can be noninvasively assessed with transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) and computed tomographic angiography (CTA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, the usefulness of TCD sonography compared with CTA in the diagnosis of nonembolic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease has not been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively examined 70 patients with clinically suspected atherothrom botic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by using TCD sonography and CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We excluded patients with a known source of cardiac emboli, significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, or classic lacunar syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TCD sonography was performed within 2 days of admission, followed by CTA within 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CTA demonstrated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis of more than 50% in 57 patients (81%), whereas only 29 patients (41%) had abnormal TCD findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CTA showed proximal M1 stenosis, distal M1 stenosis, and M2 disease in 29%, 29%, and 24% of the patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stenotic sites differed between patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> TCD results and those with abnormal results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TCD findings correlated well with CTA findings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with proximal M1 stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, TCD sonography correctly depicted distal M1 or M2 disease in only 24% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this population, CTA is superior to TCD sonography in the diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Abnormal TCD results are highly suggestive of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> TCD findings do not exclude such lesions, especially in patients with distal M1 or M2 disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Because distal M1 and M2 disease was found in half of our patients, TCD sonography should not be used as a method to screen for <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
