<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Long-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drug (AED) therapy has been associated with an increase in risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At issue is whether this risk is related to the duration of AED therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the hypothesis that the cumulative effect of long-term exposure to AEDs plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred ninety-five patients under long-term AED therapy and 195 healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects received measurement of intima media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) at the far wall of the common carotid artery (CCA) by B-mode ultrasonography to assess the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other measurements included body mass index (BMI) and blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, fasting blood sugar, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> reactive substances (TBARS), and total reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiols</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CCA <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was significantly increased in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, with male subjects exhibiting thicker <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> than their female counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whereas BMI, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>, hs-CRP, and TBARS were significantly elevated, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiols</z:chebi> were significantly reduced in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression analysis further revealed that duration of AED therapy, age, gender, and TBARS level (index for <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>) were independently associated with CCA <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the log-transformed CCA <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> increased linearly with duration of AED therapy after adjustments for age, gender, and TBARS level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The duration of AED therapy is significantly associated with the acceleration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, alongside independent contributions of age, gender, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> to the atherosclerotic process </plain></SENT>
