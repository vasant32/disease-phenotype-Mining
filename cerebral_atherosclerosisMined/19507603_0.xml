<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Totally 32 patients received a dual-energy CTA scan, along with a cerebral TOF MRA scan before or after CTA examination from one day to one month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dual-energy software was used for bone and calcified plaque subtraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five anatomical segments were described for each internal carotid artery according to Fischer (1938) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ratings were based on a 1-4 scale for the dual-energy CTA maximum intensity projection (MIP) image: 1 not diagnostic, 2 partially diagnostic, 3 diagnostic, and 4 excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesions were categorized as mild (0-29%), moderate (30%-69%), severe (70%-99%), or occluded (no flow detected) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stenosis of internal carotid artery was evaluated based on post-subtracted CTA images and TOF MRA images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 320 arterial segments, 99% of arterial segments were &gt; or = 3 score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Grading of stenosis on dual-energy CTA agreed with grading of stenoses on MRA images in 98% of arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the mild and occlusion group, the agreement was 100% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the moderate and severe group, dual-energy CTA showed more severe stenosis than MRA in 7 vessels and there was significant difference between the results from the two different modalities (Z = -3.071, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Dual-energy CTA can be used to assess the stenosis of internal arteries around skull base, but may exaggerate the severe stenosis of cerebral arteries compared with TOF MRA </plain></SENT>
