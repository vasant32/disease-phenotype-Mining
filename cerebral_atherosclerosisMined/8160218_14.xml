<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>Atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> in the cerebral arteries are distributed heterogeneously among different races </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracranial carotid lesions are reported to be more common than extracranial carotid lesions among Japanese people, which is in sharp contrast to the pattern of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, several Japanese clinicians have the impression, which has yet to be clinically proven, that extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid diseases</z:e> are recently increasing in number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred twenty-one patients who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and underwent angiography were examined in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy were admitted to our clinic from 1963 to 1965 (early group); the remaining 51 patients were seen from 1989 to 1993 (recent group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiographic findings and vascular risk factors were compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Severe <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> of the extracranial internal carotid arteries increased significantly during the ensuing 24 years between the end of the first period until the beginning of the second period (from 1965 to 1989), whereas lesions in the intracranial carotid system were similar between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the extracranial internal carotid artery was more frequent in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, which proved to be the only risk factor that showed a temporal increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in Japanese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> has been increasing in the extracranial internal carotid artery, while that in the intracranial carotid system remains unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such a temporal change may be the result, at least in part, of an increase in the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
