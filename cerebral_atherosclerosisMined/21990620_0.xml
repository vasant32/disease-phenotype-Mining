<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The safety of treatment of more distal atheromatous lesions with angioplasty has not been systematically reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our institutional database for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients treated with intracranial angioplasty and stenting from January 2008 to July 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 108 patients were treated and five patients were treated with angioplasty for a symptomatic M2 middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> with fluctuating neurological examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report our experience with these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five patients underwent technically successful treatment with a reduction of the stenosis to &lt;50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no periprocedural complications and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had cessation of their clinical fluctuations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients were found to have symptomatic restenosis with one patient suffering a disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at 5 months and the second patient a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> at 4 months who was subsequently successfully re-treated with angioplasty and stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Angioplasty of M2 <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> lesions is technically feasible in our cohort of neurologically unstable patients, but the durability of this treatment will require more extensive study </plain></SENT>
