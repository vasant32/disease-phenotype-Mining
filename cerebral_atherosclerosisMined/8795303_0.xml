<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two types of arteries were studied using high-resolution ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These were arteries with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> wall (intima, media and adventitia clearly separated) and arteries with intima-media thickening and plaques without calcification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and in 10 patients with early plaques vasa vasorum were visualised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On power-Doppler they appeared as distinct, glomerular-like perfusion units, regularly placed along the course of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arteries and at similar distance (2 to 4 mm from the lumen-wall interface, within the adventitia and periadventitia layers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In arteriosclerotic vessels the distribution of vasa vasorum units was more irregular, often concentrated in one spot with some perfusion units more distant from the lumen (between 2.5 and 5 mm) and their pulsatility was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Flow velocity complex in most vasa vasorum was comparable, in lower scale to the pattern observed in the carotid lumen without significant differences between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and arteriosclerotic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average peak systolic flow velocity was 15: +/-4 cm/sec and the average diastolic velocity was 6 +/- 4 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arteries with a median pulsatility index of 1.8 (range 2.2-1.05); in arteriosclerotic arteries velocities were 13 +/- 4 (peak systolic) and 3 +/- 2 (end diastolic) with a median pulsatility index of 1.71 (range 2.1-1.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion a different, apparent distribution of vasa vasorum was observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> carotids and in carotids with arteriosclerotic lesions </plain></SENT>
