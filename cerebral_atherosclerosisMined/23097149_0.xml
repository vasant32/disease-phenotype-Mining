<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic IAS carries one of the highest rates of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> despite intensive medical therapy (25Â % in high-risk groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical results for endovascular angioplasty and stenting have been disappointing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to review the contemporary understanding of symptomatic IAS and present potential alternative treatments to resolve factors not addressed by current therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed a literature review on IAS pathophysiology, natural history, and current treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We present an evaluation of the currently deficient aspects in its treatment and explore the role of alternative surgical approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is a well-documented interrelation between hemodynamic and embolic factors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> caused by IAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite the effectiveness of medical therapy, hemodynamic factors are not addressed satisfactorily by medications alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Collateral circulation and severity of stenosis are the strongest predictors of risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Indirect revascularization techniques, such as encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis, offer an alternative treatment to enhance collateral circulation while minimizing risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> associated with hyperemia and endovascular manipulation, with promising results in preliminary studies on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cerebrovascular occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite improvements in medical management for IAS, relevant aspects of its pathophysiology are not resolved by medical treatment alone, such as poor collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surgical indirect revascularization can improve collateral circulation and play a role in the treatment of this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further formal evaluation of indirect revascularization for IAS is a logical and worthy step in the development of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
