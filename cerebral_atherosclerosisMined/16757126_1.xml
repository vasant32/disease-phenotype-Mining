<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new hypothesis is presented on the function of factor XII, which is postulated to be a "missing link" between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stress and transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The implications of this idea are developed to show how <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stress, which involves activation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo>, can cause of cerebrovascular disease. "<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> stress" is defined as "the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> short-term physiological response to the perception of major threats or demands". "<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> stress" is "the abnormal ongoing physiological response to the continuing perception of unresolvable major threats or demands" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The factor XII hypothesis is as follows: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> stress includes release of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> by the adrenal medulla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">Epinephrine</z:chebi> activates platelets by binding to alpha-2A adrenergic receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Activated platelets convert pre-bound factor XII to its active form, which then initiates the intrinsic coagulation cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This can be called the "activated platelet initiation pathway" for coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither tissue factor nor pre-formed thrombin is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> proceeds to completion, but only a minute amount of thrombin is formed, and the process normally stops at this point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In people who lapse into a state of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stress, essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, which is also a manifestation of stress, synergizes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo>: there is both a baseline rise in blood pressure and systemic platelet activation as well as superimposed labile rises of both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Upregulation of these two stress parameters is atherogenic: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi>-activated platelets stimulating thrombin formation interact with endothelial cells activated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> to cause, first, smooth muscle cell proliferation, which is a histological hallmark of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and, lastly, a symptomatic thrombotic occlusion-the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> symptoms which often accompany this process are a marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stress and ongoing pathophysiologic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic predictions are made regarding novel ways of blocking stress-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>Hypercoagulability</z:hpo> could be targeted by monoclonal antibodies directed against the platelet-specific alpha-2 adrenergic receptor or the (putative) platelet receptor for Factor XII; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> could be treated with monoclonal antibodies directed against the beta-adrenergic receptor in the juxtaglomerular apparatus or by surgical denervation of the kidneys, either of which would decrease the renin release which helps drive the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
