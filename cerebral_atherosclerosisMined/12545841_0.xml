<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gross <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and histology of brain were observed in autopsy of 45 cases of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty cases of arteriolar hyalinization including 26 cases of brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> were found in those 45 cases of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hyalinized arterioles were divided to two types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One is characterized by the narrow lumen of terminal arterioles, the other by the dilatant lumen of proximal arterioles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Hemorrhage</z:mp> always occurred in the latter type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Besides these changes, 3 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and 5 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in arterioles were related to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> mainly occur in dilated and hyalinized arterioles, and some cases are probably related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> or atheroscleromatous atrerioles </plain></SENT>
