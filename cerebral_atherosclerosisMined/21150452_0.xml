<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the diagnostic detectability of the intracranial vasculature on contrast-enhanced whole-body magnetic resonance angiographic (WBMRA) scans at 1.5 versus 3 T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two experienced neuroradiologists scored the image quality regarding the intracranial arteries applying a 5-point scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stenoses and other findings were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Weighted Îº-statistics were calculated to assess interobserver agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Interobserver agreement was very good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Image quality scoring resulted in the following mean values: 3.0 at 1.5 T versus 3.9 at 3 T (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Venous contrast overlay and insufficient anatomic coverage occurred in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three stenoses were found at both field strengths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of the intracranial vasculature on WBMRA data is basically feasible; image quality at 3 T seems superior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Shortcomings appear because of venous contamination and insufficient volume coverage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, adding a dedicated intracranial MRA to a WBMRA protocol would substantially increase diagnostic certainty </plain></SENT>
