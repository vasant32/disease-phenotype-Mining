<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One common carotid artery was enclosed in a silastic collar to induce a neo-intima similar to that of human early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and carotid blood flow was measured periodically over 8 days in 8 conscious rabbits </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histological examination of the arterial segments at completion of the study revealed significant intimal thickening of the regions of artery enclosed in the collar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Resting blood flow was lower in the collared vascular bed as compared with the control, from as early as 2 days after surgery </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following NOLA infusion, mean arterial pressure was significantly increased and blood flow through both arteries was reduced </plain></SENT>
