<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects were divided into two groups: those with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores above 25, and those subjects with MMSE scores between 18 and 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter abnormalities</z:hpo> (WMA) (expressed as relative volumes) as well as the presence of cerebrovascular risk factors were evaluated in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that a) subjects with low MMSE scores had significantly larger relative volumes of WMA than the subjects with higher scores, b) a significant correlation (rs = 0.53, p &lt; 0.009) between MMSE scores and the relative volume of WMA was also established, and c) a weak significant correlation (rs = -0.51, p &lt; 0.05) between arterial blood pressure and WMA was found in the subjects with high MMSE scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Besides these findings no other correlations between the presence of cerebrovascular risk factors and WMA were found in any of the groups </plain></SENT>
