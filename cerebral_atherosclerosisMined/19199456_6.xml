<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The optimal treatment of medically refractory intracranial atheroocclusive disease remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The EC-IC Bypass Study Investigators found that patients with internal carotid and middle cerebral artery (ICA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion received no benefit from direct superficial temporal artery to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass, and that patients with ICA occlusion and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis may have actually fared worse after surgery, perhaps in part due to flow reversal in critical perforator-bearing segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the results of recent investigations have suggested that direct bypass may be beneficial in a subgroup of patients with hemodynamic failure secondary to unilateral ICA occlusion, similar data do not exist for patients with hemodynamic failure from other intracranial stenoocclusive diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indirect bypass via encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis offers a surgical alternative that may avoid rapid flow reversal while providing additional flow to at-risk, distal vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve patients with medically resistant hemodynamic failure from intracranial atheroocclusive disease underwent indirect vascular bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had ICA occlusion and coexistent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis, 1 patient had tandem ICA stenoses and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis, 1 patient had tandem ICA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, 1 patient had ICA and posterior cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and an ischemic hemisphere supplied via a proximal superficial temporal artery branch, and 1 patient had poor donor arteries and severe medical comorbidities that precluded the use of general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient evaluation included clinical assessment of neurological status, CT scanning, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, digital subtraction angiography, and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> reactivity, or SPECT with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient records were reviewed and patients were interviewed for outcome assessment, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, change in cerebral perfusion, graft patency, and functional level according to the modified Rankin scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier cumulative failure curves for the primary end point of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> were used to compare these patients to a control group of 81 patients derived from the literature who received medical management for severe symptomatic hemodynamic failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven patients underwent encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis and 1 patient received bur holes with dural and arachnoid incisions; the mean length of follow-up was 51.2 +/- 40.1 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five patients had decreased perfusion on follow-up despite graft patency, and 10 patients suffered new infarctions or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five patients (42%) suffered infarctions within 1 year of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis of 4 studies of patients with symptomatic ICA occlusion and severe hemodynamic failure who underwent medical treatment revealed a new infarction rate of 30% in the first year after entry into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between patients with severe hemodynamic failure who underwent surgery and those in the medically treated control group (log-rank test, p = 0.179) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The authors found that indirect bypass does not promote adequate pial collateral artery development and appears to be of limited utility in patients with symptomatic ICA or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenoocclusive disease and secondary hemodynamic failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Rates of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> after indirect bypass in this patient population do not differ from previous reports in patients who received medical management only </plain></SENT>
