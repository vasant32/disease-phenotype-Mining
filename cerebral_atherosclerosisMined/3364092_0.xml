<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A decrease in the NK activity in IS patients appears to be related to dyslipoproteinemia, which has been confirmed by the detection of a reverse correlation between the values of the NKA and the atherogenicity coefficient, while suppression of ADCC in the same patients is explained by the suppressive influence of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> system, which has been investigated in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The elucidation in IS patients of immunopathological phenomena related to impairments of the effector component of immunity and of activities of NK- and K-cells justifies the inclusion of immunocorrecting drugs into the comprehensive therapy of IS </plain></SENT>
