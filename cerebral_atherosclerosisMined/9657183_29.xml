<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: One of the largest contemporary neurosurgical experiences with hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> was analyzed for trends in patient selection and clinical variables affecting outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During a 12-year period, 60 patients underwent 62 circulatory arrest procedures: 54 had posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 4 had anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and 2 had other lesions (<z:hpo ids='HP_0010797'>hemangioblastoma</z:hpo> and vertebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The surgical morbidity and mortality rates associated with hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> were 13.3 and 8.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At late follow-up, 76% of the patients had good outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Scale scores of 1 and 2), 5% had poor outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Scale scores of 3 and 4), and 18% had died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 1992, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> was limited to posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and included increasing numbers of basilar trunk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient outcome correlated with preoperative neurological condition (admission Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score, P &lt; 0.001; Hunt and Hess grade, P = 0.037; and age, P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preservation of perforating arteries was paramount to achieving a good outcome (P = 0.005); duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Current indications for hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> include only giant and complex posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> that cannot be treated using conventional techniques or that recur after endovascular coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgical morbidity and mortality rates reflect the increasing complexity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated but are still more favorable than the natural history of these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This experience demonstrates that management in specialized neurovascular centers can minimize the morbidity associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> so that it remains a viable treatment option for complex posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
