<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> are highly prevalent in later life and frequently co-occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Structural changes in critical brain regions may underlie both conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors examined associations of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, white-matter lesions (WML) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> at different locations with depressive symptoms and cognitive functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Within the Second Manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Arterial Disease</z:e>-Memory, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> and Aging (SMART-Medea) study, cross-sectional analyses were performed in 585 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients aged ≥50 years with symptomatic atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Volumetric measures of WML and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> were obtained with 1.5 T MRI; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were rated visually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (score ��6). z Scores of executive functioning, memory and processing speed were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, education, intelligence, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, physical functioning and co-occurring brain changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Depressive symptoms were present in 102 (17%) patients and were associated with poorer memory (B=-0.26, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Large subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in deep white-matter tracts were both associated with depressive symptoms (RR=2.66, 95% CI 1.28 to 5.54; RR=2.02, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.59) and poorer executive functioning and memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Periventricular WML volume was associated with poorer executive functioning; cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the left hemisphere and media flow region, ventricular volume and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> were associated with a slower processing speed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this sample of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> older persons, subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> contributed to an increased risk of depressive symptoms as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This depended on location in projecting white-matter tracts, and not on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
