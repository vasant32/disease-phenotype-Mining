<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We compared mean extent of <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> in carotid and intracranial arteries at autopsy among age, sex, and race subgroups in New Orleans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most comparisons were made within similar broad cause-to-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> categories after excluding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> due to diseases associated with increased amount of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Use of this basal group of cases reduces the effect of selection bias due to cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in this autopsy population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fatty streaks were present in the carotid arteries of almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases even in the youngest age group (10 to 14 years) and were more extensive in blacks than in whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Raised <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> increased with age in the carotid arteries of blacks from age group 15 to 24 years and in whites from age group 25 to 34 years; black men and white men had about the same amount of raised lesions, whereas black women consistently had more than white women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the intracranial arteries, fatty streaks and fibrous plaques began from age 15 to 24 years; blacks had more raised lesions than whites, particularly in the oldest age group, 65 to 69 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings and mortality data suggest that in the 1960s and early 1970s black men and women were more susceptible to cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and cerebrovascular diseases than white men and women </plain></SENT>
