<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate whether clinical, lesion-related and procedural factors may predict in-stent restenosis (ISR) after intracranial stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-one Chinese patients with 65 lesions treated with single bare metal balloon-mounted stent for symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> underwent conventional angiographic follow-up after procedures between March 2004 and July 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical, lesion-related and procedural factors were analysed for any predictive power for the ISR using univariate and multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ISR was defined as &gt;50% stenosis within or at the edge of the stent or absolute <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> loss &gt;20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ISR was found in 18 patients (18/61, 29.5%) with 20 lesions (20/65, 30.8%) at a median follow-up of 7 months (range, 5-30 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis revealed that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, Mori classification, lesion length and stent diameter were associated with ISR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (hazard ratio (HR), 2.661; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.044-6.787; P=0.040) and lesion length (HR, 1.206; 95% CI, 1.023-1.421; P=0.026) were detected as two independent predictors for ISR by stepwise multivariate Cox regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ISR after intracranial stenting with bare metal balloon-mounted stents in our series seems to be more frequent than those reported by the majority of the published case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and lesion length are associated with increased risk of ISR </plain></SENT>
