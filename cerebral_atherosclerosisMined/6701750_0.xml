<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve specimens (15%) were found to contain these emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An attempt to correlate this finding with clinical and radiologic data yielded no evidence of an increased predisposition to recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the affected patients even in the absence of ulceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, further attention must be given to defining the drainage patterns of such embolized mural capillaries and elucidating their role, if any, in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
