<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction and gene sequencing, single nucleotide polymorphisms of ApoE gene were used to analyze 33 cases of patients with ACI and 35 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequencies of ApoE gene single nucleotide polymorphisms 465C/G, 462C/G and 451delC in the ACI group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of polymorphism 486G/T in the control group was significantly higher than that in the ACI group (P=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 465C/G,462C/G and 451delC polymorphisms might be associated with ACI.486GT allele might have protective effect on the pathogenesis of ACI </plain></SENT>
