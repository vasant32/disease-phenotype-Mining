<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Smoking is a well-known risk factor for ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, smokers have been reported to have better prognosis after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> when compared to nonsmokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the independent effect of smoking status on long-term prognosis after ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total 476 male patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> within the middle cerebral artery territory were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics and long-term prognosis were compared among smokers, ex-smokers, and nonsmokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although the baseline severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> did not differ among the groups, poor long-term outcome (Barthel index&lt;60 or modified Rankin score&gt;3) at 6 months after ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was more frequently observed in nonsmokers than in smokers (P=0.013); the outcome for ex-smokers was intermediate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age and other variables, current smoking was negatively correlated to poor long-term outcome (odds ratio, 0.286; 95% confidence interval, 0.119-0.686; P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On subgroup analysis, the impact of smoking on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prognosis was significant only in younger patients (&lt;65 years of age) and those with atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was a strong independent correlation between smoking status and long-term outcome in patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies about the impact of smoking habit on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome depending on the characteristics of patients (ie. age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype) are needed </plain></SENT>
