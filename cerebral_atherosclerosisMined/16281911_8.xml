<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>white matter abnormalities</z:hpo> are usually attributed to degenerative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> (CAA) but the evidence is scanty or inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we examined sections of frontal lobe from 125 autopsy-confirmed cases of AD and assessed the relationship of degenerative large and small vessel disease, CAA, parenchymal Abeta load and APOE genotype, to several objective measures of white matter damage: extent of immunolabelling for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), axonal accumulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP), axon density in superficial and deep white matter, and intensity of staining for myelin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found no association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878486" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriolosclerosis</z:e>, CAA or APOE genotype and white matter damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, labelling of white matter for GFAP correlated strongly with the parenchymal Abeta load (P = 0.0003) and with APP accumulation (P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that severity of frontal white matter damage in AD is closely related to parenchymal Abeta load and that in most cases the contribution of degenerative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, CAA and APOE is relatively minor </plain></SENT>
