<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Smooth muscle cells were detected in the thickened intima alongside the <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp>, in fatty streaks, in the fibrous tissue of the atherosclerotic plaque, but they were not found in the atheromatous masses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proliferation and migration of the smooth muscle cells is regarded as an essential factor in the pathogenetic mechanisms of atherosclersis </plain></SENT>
