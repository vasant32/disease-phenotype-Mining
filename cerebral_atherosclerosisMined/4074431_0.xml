<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new antithrombotic drug, cilostazol (6-[4-(1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52552">cyclohexyl</z:chebi>-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)butoxy]-3,4-dihydro-2(1H)-qui nolinone OPC-13013), was administered at daily oral doses of 75, 150 and 300 mg for 2 weeks in 15 patients with cerebrovascular disease including <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>, and patient response was determined based on the degree of suppression of the platelet function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The antiplatelet-aggregating effect of the drug was determined by measuring the rate of inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by aggregation inducers such as <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>), collagen and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The inhibition rates (percent difference between pre- and post-treatment rates/pre-treatment rate) obtained with the drug at 75 mg/day were 25.5, 36.5 (p less than 0.1) and 10.9% when platelet rich plasma (PRP) was added to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>, collagen and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The corresponding values at 150 mg/day were 34.2 (p less than 0.1), 50.7 (p less than 0.05) and 48.0% (p less than 0.1), and those at 300 mg/day were 62.1 (p less than 0.01), 71.7 (p less than 0.01) and 48.2% (p less than 0.1), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effect of the drug thus appeared to be dose-related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adhesiveness was also reduced by the drug, though a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001892'>bleeding tendency</z:hpo> was not indicated, and the reduction was found to be significant at 300 mg/day (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The drug can, therefore, be considered to be a potent and safe antiplatelet-aggregating agent </plain></SENT>
