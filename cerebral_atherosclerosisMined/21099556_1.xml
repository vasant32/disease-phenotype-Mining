<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Large and giant lesions often have thicker, atheromatous walls as well as intra-aneurysmal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> that combine to prevent traditional clips from closing properly in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report the development and use of a novel clip design specifically tailored to treat atheromatous, thrombotic, or previously coiled <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 6 patients with complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> not amenable to simple neck clipping and not considered appropriate for endovascular therapy who were treated using a novel "compression" clip design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe the development and use of a novel <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clip design with blades that are not opposed at rest to allow direct clipping of atheromatous, thrombotic, and previously coiled <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four patients had recurrent, previously coiled <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>; one of these also had a large thrombotic component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients had complex lesions with heavy atheroma involving a portion of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no complications related to the use of the clip, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients did well without neurological complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In every case, the clip allowed straightforward obliteration of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> without the need for temporary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e>, aneurysmorrhaphy, or removal of an intra-aneurysmal coil mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent intraoperative angiography to confirm obliteration of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with preservation of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Atheromatous, thrombotic, and previously coiled <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> may not be treatable with simple neck clipping and may not be curable with endovascular therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For such cases, we designed a novel "compression" clip that has been used safely and successfully in our experience with good short-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
