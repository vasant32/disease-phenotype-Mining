<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study was to evaluate the outcome and factors related to the adverse events (AEs) of BEICS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 100 consecutive patients who underwent BEICS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the procedural success (residual stenosis &lt; 50%), AEs (minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>), clinical outcome, and restenosis (&gt; 50%) at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed 18 factors including symptom patterns related to AE rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptom patterns revealed 1) stable patients (n = 73) with improving, stationary, or resolved symptoms; and 2) unstable patients (n = 27) with gradual worsening or fluctuating symptoms (National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale [NIHSS] &gt; or = 4) within 2 days before stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The procedural success rate was 99% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, there were 10 (10%) AEs within the 6 months: 4 (4%) minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 3 (3%) major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, and 3 (3%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> including a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AE rate was 4.1% in stable and 25.9% in unstable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Restenosis at 6 months revealed 0% (0/59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Good outcome (modified Rankin Scale &lt; or = 2) at 6 months was 97% (71/73) in stable and 67% (18/27) in unstable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Stepwise logistic regression model revealed that symptom pattern (unstable versus stable) was the only significant risk factor (OR, 8.167; 95% CI, 1.933-34.500; P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BEICS revealed a low AE and good outcome rate at 6 months, especially in the stable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Midterm outcome was also favorable in the unstable patient group </plain></SENT>
