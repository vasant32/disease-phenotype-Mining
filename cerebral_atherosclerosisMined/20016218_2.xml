<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on a national survey, we examined mortality rates during the first 3 years after a first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (IS) and the major predictors of short-term (1 month) and long-term (3 years) mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the National <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Israeli Survey (NASIS 2004), data were collected on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hospitalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients in Israel during a 2-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mortality rates for first-ever IS were assessed at 1 month and 3 years and predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazard model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1,079 first-ever IS patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival data were complete for over 99% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cumulative mortality rates were 9.9% at 1 month and 31.1% at 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the survivors at 1 month, 23.5% did not survive for 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 1 month, the hazard ratio (HR) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> significantly increased with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One-month mortality was also associated with a decreased level of consciousness (HR 2.9, 95% CI 1.7-5.1), total anterior circulation infarction (TACI); HR 4.9, 95% CI 1.6-15.2), temperature on admission (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.1 per 1 degrees C), age (HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.07 per year) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels on admission (HR 1.003, 95% CI 1.001-1.006 per 1 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age-adjusted proportions of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> were considerably higher in the deceased compared with survivors at 3 years (48 vs. 38 and 21 vs. 9%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate survival analyses, predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 1 month also predicted <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 3 years; however, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.4), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0-2.4), peripheral artery disease (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.8), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.4) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.7) were additional predictors of long-term mortality for patients surviving the first month after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one third of patients did not survive 3 years after the first-ever IS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>While age and markers of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were the major predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 1 month, comorbidities and variables associated with atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> predicted long-term mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Improved control of these factors can potentially reduce long-term mortality in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> victims </plain></SENT>
