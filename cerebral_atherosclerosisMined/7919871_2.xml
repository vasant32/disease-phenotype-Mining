<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The noninvasive quantification of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> by 3D ultrasound was performed by a 3D computer-based image reconstruction (3D ultrasound) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The linear movements of the transducer were driven by a motor triggered by ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The method included an option to change angle insonation and a correction of skin contact adaptation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repeated measurements were performed in a weekly interval in 60 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three evaluation procedures (manual tracing, threshold procedure, watershed algorithm) were developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intraexaminer mean variability varied between 2.8 (watershed algorithm) and 4.4% (threshold procedure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interexaminer mean variability ranged from 3.8 (manual tracing) to 6.8% (threshold procedure), follow-up measurements from 5.3 (watershed algorithm) to 8.9% (threshold procedure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The newly developed 3D computer-based image reconstruction allows repeated quantification of moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> with a low variability and will be applied in prospective studies of the regression or progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
