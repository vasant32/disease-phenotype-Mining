<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This yielded 115 cerebral hemispheres at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the time of arteriography, 93 hemispheres were asymptomatic regarding the hemisphere with siphon stenosis (group I), whereas 22 hemispheres in 22 patients had had neurologic events referable to the hemisphere with siphon stenosis (group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During follow-up (range 1 to 62 months, mean 22.5 months), 64.5% of initially asymptomatic hemispheres remained asymptomatic, 6.5% experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>), and 4.3% developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the same follow-up period, 63.6% of initially symptomatic hemispheres became asymptomatic, 9.1% had recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>, and 9.1% developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of 71 group I patients (22.5%) and 5 of 22 group II patients (22.7%) died during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> was 6.5% and 8.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> between group I and group II </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with carotid siphon stenosis are at an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> compared with the population at large </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is less than the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> assumed to be caused by carotid bifurcation disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
