<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the variability in assessment of the principal inherent characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> through the evaluation of interobserver variability for material with uniform quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blinded interpretations of a single set of cerebral arteriograms of 55 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were evaluated by several statistical approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Excellent correlations were found for the detection and measurement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> after adjusting for geometric distortion caused by magnification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Progressively decreasing correspondence was found for factors that characterized <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, including, in order, determination of margins, assessment of accessory appendages, and identification of a neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Correction for geometric distortion was the most critical factor that influenced uniform measurement of size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Standards for measurement and morphologic characteristics were subsequently established for use in the International Study of Unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>Intracranial Aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
