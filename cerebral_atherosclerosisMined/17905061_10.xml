<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The proportionally higher incidence of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> among Asian and black patients and a greater proclivity for intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> in the Hispanic population merit drawing attention to a Latin American experience with intracranial arterial stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of an observational study of 33 intracranial lesions (each &gt;50% stenosis) in 32 patients treated by intracranial angioplasty in 6 Latin American centers over a 3-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The investigation used a unique device, a balloon-expandable stent (Lekton Motion stent system, now Pharos, Biotronik, AG, BÃ¼lach, Switzerland) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The treated patients ranged in age from 30 to 81 years (mean, 59.3 years; SD, 12 years), including 24 male and 8 female patients (sex ratio, 4:1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two were Asians, 4 were blacks, and the rest were white Hispanic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our mean follow-up is of 10.2 months (SD, 7.84 months), with a mortality rate of 9.4% (3/32), a nonfatal complication rate of 6.2%, and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate (rate of recurrence) of 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean pretreatment stenosis of 68.75% (SD, 14%) was reduced to a residual of 5.16% (SD, 16%) (P = .000; 95% confidence interval, 56.8%-70.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A control angiogram was performed in 82% of patients, and in that case, the restenosis 50% or greater was of 8.7% during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The treatment of intracranial stenosis with the Lekton Motion stent (Pharos) is feasible with a high technical success rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Restenosis as well as the rate of new neurologic events during follow-up suggests some efficacy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention by using the latest-generation, highly trackable, balloon-expandable stents </plain></SENT>
