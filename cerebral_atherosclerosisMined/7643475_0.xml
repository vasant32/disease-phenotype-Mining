<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the cerebral and coronary arteries, we examined the prevalence of asymptomatic atheromatous cerebrovascular lesions in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects consisted of 33 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> patients with angiographically proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0005145'>coronary artery stenosis</z:hpo>/occlusion(s) who had no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo>, and 33 age/sex matched controls without a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart diseases</z:e> or/and cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic cerebrovascular lesions were evaluated by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) with a 3-dimensional time-of-flight method within 2 months after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The evaluated arteries on MRA included the carotid bifurcation and the intracranial arteries (intracranial portion of the internal carotid artery, horizontal portion of the middle cerebral artery, and the basilar artery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic cerebrovascular stenotic lesions (more than 25% stenosis) on MRA were found in 8 AMI patients (24.2%) at the carotid artery bifurcation and 5 (15.2%) in the intracranial arteries, compared to 1 (3.0%) and 3 (9.1%) respectively in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lesions in the carotid bifurcation were significantly frequent in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> patients (p &lt; 0.05), while those in the intracranial arteries did not differ between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> patients with the intracranial artery lesions were significantly older than those without such lesions (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data obtained indicates that the coexistence of asymptomatic atheromatous cerebrovascular diseases, especially the lesions in the carotid bifurcation, should be considered in treating patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The older <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> patients, who may have not only extracranial lesions but also intracranial lesions, should be treated more carefully </plain></SENT>
