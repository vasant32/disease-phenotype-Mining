<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) is an inflammatory marker associated with subsequent coronary events and neointimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> after coronary artery stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine if elevated levels of hsCRP are associated with restenosis after placement of extra- and intracranial stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 73 consecutive patients at Michigan State University from July 2006 until June 2007 who underwent treatment with carotid artery stent placement or intracranial stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were collected in regards to demographics, pre-procedural hsCRP, and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> levels, and angiographic variables characterizing the lesion before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A binary logistic regression model was constructed to determine independent predictors of restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 73 patients with a mean age of 69 +/- 11 years were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 57 patients were treated with extracranial carotid stenting, 22 (38%) of whom were symptomatic, while 16 patients underwent intracranial stenting (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were symptomatic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 9 patients (4 intracranial stents [25%] and 5 carotid stents [8.8%]) who developed a restenosis of &gt;50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In binary logistic regression modeling, the following variables were found to be independently predictive of developing restenosis: smaller vessel diameter (OR .49, 95% CI .23-.98, P-value .046) and elevated hsCRP (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.29-6.66, P-value .018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of pre-procedural hsCRP may be predictive of the development of neointimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> in patients treated with extra- or intracranial stenting procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future prospective multicenter studies will be required to confirm these findings </plain></SENT>
