<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study was designed to present the treatment outcomes with Wingspan stent angioplasty of high-grade intracranial vertebrobasilar artery (VBA) stenosis in symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 2007 and 2010, the records of 30 patients with 31 intracranial high-grade VBA stenoses (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ��� 70%) who underwent elective stenting due to the failure of medical therapy were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluation was performed based on the modified Rankin scale and the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the stent deployment was technically successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean stenosis decreased significantly from 82.28 ± 8.02% (range, 72-99%) to 11.18 ± 7.28% (range, 0-25%) after stent-assisted angioplasty (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Periprocedure complications occurred in 3 (10%) of 30 patients; there were 2 cases of perforator <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and 1 case of transient flow insufficiency with stent overlap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up (mean, 17.81 ± 11.49 months; range, 5-40 months) was available for 27 patients, and angiographic follow-up (mean, 9.95 ± 5.74 months, range, 5-20 months) was available for 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only one case demonstrated recurrent symptoms with restenosis (≥ 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no recurrent ischemic events and no cases of restenosis in the other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: According to our data, the Wingspan stent for symptomatic intracranial VBA stenoses is a safe and efficacious treatment alternative in cases with recurrent symptoms despite medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the improvement of outcome requires the reduction in the rate of procedure-related complications and long-term outcomes still have to be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
