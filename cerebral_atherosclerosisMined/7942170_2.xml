<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to further elucidate the pathogenesis of the direct carotid cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> (dCCF) clinical, patho-anatomical, and physico-mechanical studies were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 27 of 42 patients the dCCF were found to be localized in the segment C4 (according to Teufel, 12), in 13 patients in segment C2 and in only 2 patients in segment C3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients with dCCF in segment C4 were significantly younger than those with dCCF in the segments C2 or C3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In none of the patients fractures of the bony walls of the cavernous part of the internal carotid artery (ICA) could be ascertained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On human cadavers it was affirmed that the cavernous branches of the ICA arise nearly exclusively from the top of segment C3 and from the lateral wall of segment C2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The strength of the wall of the cavernous part of the ICA was shown to decline with age as revealed by means of a tensile machine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the four segments investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As revealed by roentgenograms the distensibility of the ICA within its coverings was shown to be greatest in the segments C2 and C4 and lowest in segment C3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A sudden increase of the intraluminal pressure ruptured the ICA exclusively in the segments C2 and C4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histological preparations revealed that the trabeculae of the cavernous sinus insert tangentially into the adventitia of the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together these findings strongly support the view that the dCCF are mainly due to a sudden increase of the intraluminal pressure of the ICA </plain></SENT>
