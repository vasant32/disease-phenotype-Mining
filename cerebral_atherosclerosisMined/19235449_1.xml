<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vascular endothelial cell (VEC) injury represents a major initiating step in the process of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, which may lead to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>. "Circulating endothelial cell" (CEC) is an index of ongoing endothelial injury, while intimal-medial thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) detected by sounography was used to evaluate the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, to our knowledge, there is no study that investigated the relationship of these two determinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study was designed to address correlate CEC with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The study population consisted of 30 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (ACI) and 30 age- and sex-matched volunteers as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CEC counts were determined using Hladovec's method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects underwent a 2-dimensional ultrasound examination of both carotid arteries to measure <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CEC counts in ACI group were significantly increased compared with control group (4.88+/-2.14 cells /0.91 microl vs 2.73+/-1.95/0.9 microl, P&lt;0.01); <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in ACI patients was also significantly thicker compared with volunteers (2.72+/-1.07 mm vs 1.73+/-0.99 mm, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was positive correlation between CEC counts and maximal carotid artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in both groups (r=0.522, P&lt;0.01 in ACI patients and r=0.395, P&lt;0.05 in healthy volunteers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Circulating endothelial cell counts can directly reflect the vascular injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CEC counts parallel <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The CEC may be an independent predictor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
