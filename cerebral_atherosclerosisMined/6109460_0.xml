<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>After setting up a catalogue of complaints and signs for the most frequent disturbances of feeling tone of the patients suffering from cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>, consisting of somatically subjective head pain and mental disturbances, treatment was given to 33 patients with cerebrovascular disturbances and 7 patients with similar, although non-vascular, disturbances (4 patients with presenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, 3 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000362'>otosclerosis</z:hpo>), the treatment consisting of eutergin 3 X 1 tablets to 3 X 2 tablets daily, the concomitant cardio-internistic medication remaining the same throughout the treatment course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The type and severity of the symptoms prevailing in each case were determined at the beginning, after 3 weeks and after 6 weeks of the medication with eutergin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was found that improvement of the somatic-subjective head pain was more pronounced than that of the mental disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Generally speaking, the disturbing somatic or mental signs were those which could be influenced better than the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As far as the head pain was concerned, the feeling of giddiness, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> in the head, rapid exhaustion, above <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo>, responded best to the medication (the improvement amounting to approximately 40%), whereas of the mental complaints, a feeling of being "lost" or "abandoned" and a morose mood were most amenable to improvement (degree of improvement approximately 30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevention of the delirogenic effect of antidepressives in senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was a remarkable effect; this means that effective antidepressive medication is made possible with the help of eutergin, EEG controls did not reveal any significant effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elevated blood pressure levels showed a tendency to become <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> without any dramatic drops </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hence, eutergin is recommended in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> kinds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cerebrovascular lesions, provided it is associated with concomitant cardiac and internistic treatment </plain></SENT>
