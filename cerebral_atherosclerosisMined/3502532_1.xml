<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Pure sensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="53277">PSS</z:chebi>) is typically caused by a lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> located in the ventral-posterior (VP) thalamic nucleus contralateral to the paresthetic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lesion is usually so small that it cannot be seen on computerized tomography (CT), as illustrated by our case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our moderately hypertensive, 72-year-old patient with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53277">PSS</z:chebi>, CT scanning and conventional nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI) scanning using a 7-mm-thick slice on a 1.5 Tesla instrument <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> failed to visualize the thalamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the high-resolution mode with 2-mm slice thickness it was, however, clearly seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, NMRI unexpectedly showed diffuse periventricular demyelinization as well as three other lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, i.e., findings characteristic of subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (SAE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This prompted psychometric testing, which revealed signs of mild (subclinical) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, in particular involving visiospatial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002186'>apraxia</z:hpo>; this pointed to decreased function of the right parietal cortex, which was structurally intact on CT and NMRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computerized tomography by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi>-133 injection and by hexamethyl-propyleneamine-oxim labeled with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">Technetium</z:chebi>-99m showed asymmetric distribution of cerebral blood flow (CBF), with an 18% lower value in the right parietal cortex compared to the left side; this indicated asymmetric disconnection of the cortex by the SAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the tomograms of the functional parameter, CBF, correlated better with the deficits revealed by neuropsychological testing than by CT or NMRI </plain></SENT>
