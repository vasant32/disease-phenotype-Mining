<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to evaluate professionals working at a University Hospital as to their knowledge and attitudes towards <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Individuals working in the hospital were divided in two groups, Health care workers (HCW) and non-Health care workers (NHCW), and further subdivided according to level of schooling, resulting in seven strata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A closed questionnaire addressing epidemiology, risk factors, pathophysiology, typical symptoms, treatment, clinical course and personal attitudes towards smoking and blood pressure control, was applied to a random sample of each stratum (total n = 309) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The physicians group included 48 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Kruskal-Wallis test for multiple comparisons of non-parametric data was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Special attention was given to the wrong answers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Physicians correctly answered 92.6% of the questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their performance was superior to that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subgroups of questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, a large number of errors was found in questions addressing mortality and hospital mortality following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the intimate relation between coronary and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment options in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> are also poorly recognised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although physicians general knowledge about <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is good, they frequently do not perceive it as a critical disease requiring urgent hospital evaluation and care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The importance of a thorough cardiac evaluation following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and of the intimate relation between cardiac and cerebral ischemic disease is also unclear to this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>More hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> teaching and practical training in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> could possibly fill these gaps </plain></SENT>
