<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The functional state of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and its autonomic compartment was investigated in 15 men, aged 40-52 years, during their 30-day exposure to head-down tilt (-8 degrees) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Group 1 consisted of 9 subjects with early manifestations of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and Group 2 included 6 subjects with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The control group incorporated 9 healthy volunteers, aged 25-39 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During adaptation to head-down tilt, middle-aged and young subjects showed consistent changes in the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In response to perturbation effects, autonomic reactions were inert and autonomic support was excessive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of responses, duration and slow recovery of the parameters examined indicated that mechanisms of autonomic regulation were inadequate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These changes were most distinct in middle-aged subjects, particularly in Group 2 subjects: recovery of the functional state of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system was completed by day 20 in middle-aged subjects and by day 9 in young subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The observations have demonstrated that the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system of most middle-aged subjects (taking into consideration age-related and atherosclerotic changes) has a sufficiently high level of functional capabilities during medium-duration head-down tilt studies </plain></SENT>
