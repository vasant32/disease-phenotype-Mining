<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In each patient, the media of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the major intracranial arteries contained much fewer reticular fibres than those of individuals without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These fibres were mainly sparser in the outer part of the media, resembling the pattern seen in patients with ruptured berry <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the deficiency in reticular fibres may predispose to rupture even at the early stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
