<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data concerning these types of infarction are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using data from the Lausanne <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Registry, we studied patients with a CT-proven infarction of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territory that covered at least two of three <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> subterritories (deep, superficial anterior [superior] and posterior [inferior] territory) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared these patients with patients presenting more limited infarction in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our study group of large <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (laMCA) infarction contained 208 patients, corresponding to 7.6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ischemic infarctions in the Lausanne <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two patients had complete infarction in the whole <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory (coMCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion (41%) and ICA dissection (12%) were more common than in limited superficial <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (lsMCA) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and anterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the patients without ICA occlusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (33%; p &lt; 0.002) and cardiogenic embolism in general (54%; p &lt; 0.001) were more frequent in laMCA than in lsMCA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Severe neurologic deficit (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and hemisensory loss in the face, arm and leg, hemianopia, global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, reduced consciousness) was more common than in other types of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A combination of these symptoms had a positive predictive value for laMCA infarction of 0.73 (sensitivity for left side laMCA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, 0.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mortality (17%) and severe disability (50%) were higher with laMCA than for other <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of the 35 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> could be attributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Reduced consciousness, hemianopia, and coMCA infarction were independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or severe disability; for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> only, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> was an independent predictor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients who died because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> were younger than patients whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was due to other causes (mean age, 57 versus 73 years; p &lt; 0.001); they also died sooner (mean time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 5 versus 37 days; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> on the day of admission were more likely to die because of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarction</z:e> is associated with cardiogenic embolism, ICA occlusion, and ICA dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It is a major predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and severe disability, although a lower frequency of malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was found than previously reported </plain></SENT>
