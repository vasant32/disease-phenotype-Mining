<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Studies in patients with extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> have shown that high-resolution magnetic resonance direct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> imaging (MRDTI) can reliably identify intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, which may be a better predictor of clinical events than traditional radiographic methods such as percent stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present the use of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging for the detection of intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: High-resolution 3 Tesla MRDTI was performed using T1-weighted scans with an inversion pulse to null the signal from blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abnormal intraplaque T1 signal compatible with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or blood products was defined as equal to or higher than 150% of T1 signal of adjacent muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The symptomatic middle cerebral artery demonstrated intraplaque signal higher than 150% of the muscle signal in two central slices, consistent with the imaging characteristics of intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> demonstrated in extracranial carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High-resolution MRDTI of intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> could provide a surrogate marker of plaque activity in vivo and could lead to improvements in risk stratification and treatment of this common disease </plain></SENT>
