<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The examinations were interpreted independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A positive ultrasound interpretation indicated the presence of moderate to extensive atheromatous plaque, while a negative interpretation indicated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vessels or minimal atheromatous disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten percent of the ultrasound examinations were technically unsatisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining studies, there was satisfactory correlation between ultrasound and angiography in approximately 85% and disagreement in 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of ultrasound errors were "false positive" (although these probably represent false-negative angiograms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although atheromatous disease was accurately detected by ultrasound, stenosis, ulceration, intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, and vessel occlusion were not reliably identified </plain></SENT>
