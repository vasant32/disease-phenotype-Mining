<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purposes of this study were to determine the optimal time for initial follow-up angiography, the restenosis rate after successful intracranial percutaneous transluminal cerebral angioplasty (PTCBA), and finally to identify lesion-specific characteristics for predicting successful angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients underwent PTCBA with follow-up angiography 3 and 12 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although 27 lesions were adequately dilated, permanent complications occurred in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The restenosis rate at 3 months was 29.6 %; patients without restenosis at 3 months remained free from vessel narrowing at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Restenosis occurred on severe, eccentric lesions, total occlusions or extremely angulated lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a strong correlation between sufficient <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and lower restenosis rate, and concentric and short lesions (type A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the optimal time for initial angiographic follow-up is 3 months after PTCBA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PTCBA is most suitable for type A lesions with higher success, lower morbidity and lower restenosis rates </plain></SENT>
