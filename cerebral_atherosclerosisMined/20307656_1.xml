<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it exhibits variable dissolution and low bioavailability after oral administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31403">Cinnarizine</z:chebi> for injection was developed in order to enhance its bioavailability and make the practice more convenient for patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to compare the pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31403">cinnarizine</z:chebi> following intravenous and oral administration in dogs and provide scientific basis for the development of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31403">cinnarizine</z:chebi> for injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Beagle dogs were given single- or multiple-dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31403">cinnarizine</z:chebi> by oral (single-dose: 10mg/kg; multiple-dose: 21.5, 12.9, 4.3mg/kg) and intravenous (single-dose: 10mg/kg; multiple-dose: 10, 6, 2mg/kg) routes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HPLC was applied to detect the plasma concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31403">cinnarizine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics parameters were calculated and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31403">cinnarizine</z:chebi> following oral administration in dogs was found to fit the one-compartment mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>That of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31403">cinnarizine</z:chebi> following intravenous injection in dogs was found to fit the two-compartment model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relative bioavailability of oral administration was 46.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31403">Cinnarizine</z:chebi> cumulated significantly in dogs when 10mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31403">cinnarizine</z:chebi> was injected repeatedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multiple-dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31403">cinnarizine</z:chebi> over 6mg/kg induced reversible kidney injury in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study indicates that pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics properties of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31403">cinnarizine</z:chebi> for injection show advantages over the oral preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>But caution should be taken with the cumulative action when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31403">cinnarizine</z:chebi> is injected and the dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31403">cinnarizine</z:chebi> should be lower than 6mg/kg </plain></SENT>
