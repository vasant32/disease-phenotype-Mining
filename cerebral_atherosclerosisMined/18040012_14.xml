<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are limited data on the relationship between control of vascular risk factors and vascular events in patients with symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We utilized the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease study database to analyze vascular and lifestyle risk factors at baseline and averaged over the course of the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cutoff levels defining good control for each factor were prespecified based on national guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endpoints evaluated included 1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or 2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate associations were assessed using the log-rank test and multivariable analysis was done using Cox proportional hazards regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From baseline until year 2 follow-up, there was not a significant improvement in blood pressure control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the same period, there were improvements in patients with total cholesterol &lt;200 mg/dL (54.6% to 79.2%, p &lt; 0.001) or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> &lt;100 mg/dL (28.7% to 55.9%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis showed that systolic blood pressure &gt;or=140 mm Hg (HR = 1.79, p = 0.0009, 95% confidence limits 1.27 to 2.52), no alcohol consumption (HR 1.69, 1.21 to 2.39, p = 0.002), and cholesterol &gt;or=200 mg/dL (HR 1.44, 1.004 to 2.07, p = 0.048) were associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The same risk factors were predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> alone in multivariable analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated blood pressure and cholesterol levels in symptomatic patients with intracranial stenosis are associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and other major vascular events </plain></SENT>
