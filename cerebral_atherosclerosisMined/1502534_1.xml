<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients showed significantly more atheromatous plaques at the carotid bifurcation, as well in the internal and external carotid artery (chi-square-test, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference between normotensive patients on haemodialysis and the control group, but hypertensive patients showed statistically significant more plaques of the cervical vessels (chi-square-test, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, atheromatous plaques in haemodialysis patients appear to be due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> rather than to maintenance dialysis </plain></SENT>
