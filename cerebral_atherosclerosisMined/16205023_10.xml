<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using B-mode ultrasonography, carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was measured in 1,297 patients (593 men and 704 women) in the medical department of Seiyo Municipal Nomura Hospital between August 1996 and April 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> was 32.5% among men and 35.9% among women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On comparing subjects with an equal number of components of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, it was found that the prevalence of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was significantly higher in subjects with elevated blood pressure than in those without, and increased with the number of components in the former group (p for trend = 0.0277), but not in the latter (p for trend = 0.5159) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis, after adjustment for confounding factors, elevated blood pressure (OR, 1.771; 95% CI, 1.246-2.519), low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> (OR, 1.391; 95% CI, 1.053-1.836) and number of components of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (OR, 1.561; 95% CI, 1.103-2.209) were significantly associated with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
