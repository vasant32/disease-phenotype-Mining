<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (18·5%) had FDP in the CSF (range 0·7-3·75 μg/ml.) and of these 13 (87%) had associated CSF protein abnormalities and 9 (60%) were hypertensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean serum FDP values were the same (4·4 μg/ml.) in patients with and without FDP in the CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients had raised serum FDP concentrations but no FDP in the CSF </plain></SENT>
