<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to prolonged ischaemic neurological deficits carotid angiography had been performed 3 weeks previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It revealed marked <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> predominantly narrowing the distal right carotid siphon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI confirmed ischaemic lesions and massive deficits of perfusion in the right ICA cerebral territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stent-grafting was performed successfully, but subsequent angiography revealed a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> adjacent to the stent, between the right carotid siphon and the cavernous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On angiography 10 days later, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> no longer was present, and flow MRI were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>; the patient was by then asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>Arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> can thus complicate following endovascular stenting </plain></SENT>
