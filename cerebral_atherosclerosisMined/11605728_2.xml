<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initial studies have shown genetic alterations at the microsatellite level in the DNA of atherosclerotic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Extending our initial findings, we performed a microsatellite analysis on cerebral atherosclerotic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-seven cerebral atherosclerotic plaques were assessed for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and microsatellite instability (MI) using 25 microsatellite markers located on chromosomes 2, 8, 9 and 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from the vessels as well as the respective blood from each patient and subjected to polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our analyses revealed that specific loci on chromosomes 2, 8, 9 and 17 exhibited a significant incidence of LOH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-six percent of the specimens showed loss of heterozygosity at 2p13-p21, 48% exhibited LOH at 8p12-q11.2, while allelic imbalance was detected in 47% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The LOH incidence was 39%, 31% and 27% at 17q21, 9q31-34 and 17p13, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genetic alterations were detected at a higher rate as compared to the corresponding alterations observed in plaques from other vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This is the first microsatellite analysis using atherosclerotic plaques obtained from cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate an elevated mutational rate on specific chromosomal loci, suggesting a potential implication of these regions in atherogenesis </plain></SENT>
