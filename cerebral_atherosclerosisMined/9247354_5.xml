<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HS isomers were separated as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36233">disaccharide</z:chebi> units by high-performance liquid chromatography after degeneration with HS and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> lyases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Heparitinase facilitated differentiation of eight unsaturated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36233">disaccharides</z:chebi> (deltaDi-S(HS)) of vascular HS isomers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The HS isomers in the cerebral arteries consisted of approximately half the total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycans</z:chebi> (GAGs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both HS (and GAGs) tended to increase with the processes of aging but decreased with the advancing development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The HS isomers consisted of a higher proportion of non-sulfated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36233">disaccharide</z:chebi>, about 2/3 of the total HS, followed by mono-sulfated and bis-sulfated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23008">saccharides</z:chebi>; in addition, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> existed, albeit in minute amounts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of deltaDi-S(HS) rich in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> compared with HS isomers tended to increase with aging but most decreased during formation of the atheroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Putative functions of HS isomers in cerebral arteries are discussed, based on the characteristic distribution of HS components </plain></SENT>
