<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The earliest lesions developed at remarkably localized areas of the basilar artery-posterior cerebral artery Y-bifurcation (area A) and vertebral arteries-basilar artery confluence (area B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These findings were obtained from a thorough scanning electron microscopic survey of the dorsal surface of the cerebral artery segment covering from the vertebral arteries to the posterior cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By light microscopy intimal lesions were mainly composed of accumulations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003651'>foam cells</z:hpo> and smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopically <z:hpo ids='HP_0003651'>foam cells</z:hpo> accumulated in the intima resembled those of a monocyte-macrophage lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early lesions involving only a few endothelial cells with adherent leukocytes occurred at the dividing and confluent portions of the endothelial arrays formed in areas A and B, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> coupled with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> induces <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in particular vulnerable regions of the cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
