<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Nonuremic patients with apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> memory and behavior, studied by means of cerebral computed tomography and found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> (CA), evidenced functional intellectual deficits when they underwent psychometric testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The finding of CA has been repeatedly reported in limited case groups of uremic patients who also demonstrated functional intellectual deficits on the basis of the same tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study considered <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diagnostic cerebral computed tomography scans done in our department between 1981 and 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five uremic patients in conservative treatment (CT) and 111 patients in hemodialysis treatment (HT) were selected on the basis of the following two criteria: primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> as the cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0009644'>uremia</z:mp> and an age &lt; or =55 years to exclude involutive brain changes occurring with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The aims of the study were to determine the percent of uremic patients with CA, the characteristics of their CA (cortical or subcortical), and eventual associated morphological lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CA was detected in 50.9% (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> in 47.3% and subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in 3.6%) of the uremic patients in CT and in 77.5% of those in HT (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> in 65.7% and subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in 7.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average degree of CA was 0.872 in the patients in CT and 1.765 in the patients in HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four of the patients in the CT group and 46 in the HT group were hypertensive: these patients had a more severe degree of CA than the nonhypertensive subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the CT group, the degree of CA in the hypertensive patients was 1.205 versus 0.428 for the nonhypertensive subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the HT group, the degree of CA was 2.087 for the hypertensive patients versus 1.538 for the nonhypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the overall population, 7.8% had ischemic lesions, 9.6% had endocranial calcifications, and 5.4% evidenced periventricular white matter hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The high percent of CA found in young uremic patients increased in subjects in HT and, even more so in hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004934'>Vascular calcifications</z:hpo>, focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and leukoaraiosis, well-known expressions of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> state of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241832" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular insufficiency</z:e>, were also found in HT patients; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> alone is a recognized accelerator of vascular damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, early and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and related hypoperfusion can be considered as the paramount causes of parenchymal cerebral damage in <z:mp ids='MP_0009644'>uremia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
