<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCTA</z:e>) is increasingly used to treat extracerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluates the safety and efficacy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCTA</z:e> treatment of symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A series of 22 vessels in 17 patients were treated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCTA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had recurrent neurological symptoms referable to the stenotic vessel despite optimal medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Critical (&gt; 70%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> was confirmed by angiogram, and angioplasty was performed with a 3.0- to 3.5-mm Stealth balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average preangioplasty stenosis (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial criteria) was 72 +/- 8% (mean +/- SD), with a significant improvement seen after angioplasty; the best angiographic stenosis (after healing of intimal injury, if any) was 43 +/- 24% (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCTA</z:e> was successful in 82% of the vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> during angioplasty for a 30-day morbidity rate of 9.1% per treated vessel and 11.7% per case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other 15 patients were clinically evaluated at 3 and 6 months; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases were without further events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Restenosis was evaluated in 8 patients (12 vessels) with an angiogram at 6 months showing further improvement compared with the initial post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCTA</z:e> stenosis (51 +/- 10% versus 37 +/- 21% [P = .05]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCTA</z:e> may be a beneficial therapy in selected cases of symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further study using a randomized trial is needed </plain></SENT>
