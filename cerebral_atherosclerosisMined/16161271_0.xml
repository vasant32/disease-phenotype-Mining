<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: 1) control group: healthy people, 30 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2) AS group: 22 cases with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patients were divided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3) 2W group: 21 cases, the patients' course of disease was shorter than two weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>4) 6M group: 20 cases, the patients' course of disease was from six months to four years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were checked with cognitive P300 and transcranial doppler ultrasound (TCD) and mini-mental status examination (MMSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULT: The result revealed that the P300 incubation period in 2W group, 6M group and the AS group was remarkable extend than the control group (P&lt;0.01), meanwhile the period of the 6M group was longer than the AS group (P&lt;0.05); the amplitude of the wave of the 2W group and 6M group were shorter than the control group (P&lt;0.05; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The velocities of bilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and right ACA were remarkable improved in AS group (P&lt;0.05; 0.01), and the velocities of left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> both in 2W and 6M group, the right ACA and BA in 6M group were remarkably decreased than the control group (P&lt;0.05; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The grades of MMSE in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were lower than the control group and the grades in 6M group was lower than the AS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There are some changes in the P300 and abnormality of brain blood supply in the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patients and AS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The longer the course, the more serious of the cognition with the patients </plain></SENT>
