<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The series consists of 94 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight subjects (45 m, 49 f, average age 61 +/- 5) subdivided as follows: 38 suffering from cerebral vasculopathy (group A), 41 from ischaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopathy</z:e> (group B), 15 from peripheral vasculopathy (group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred controls aged between 41 and 70 and free from hepato-renal, endocrinometabolic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> were also considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the case of each sample, plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TG), total cholesterol (TC), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-3 cholesterol (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-3-C), <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-2-cholesterol <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-2-C), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>/TC and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-2-C/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> ratios were determined with the enzymatic method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In group A, an increase in TG (P less than 0.05) was observed with respect to the controls, while values of TC and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> were slightly lower: values of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-3-C and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-2-C were decidedly down (P less than 0.01); the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>/TC and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-3-C/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> ratios were decidedly reduced (respectively P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In subjects suffering from ischaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopathy</z:e> (group B), TG values (P less than 0.05) were somewhat higher than the controls and TC and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> did not differ significantly </plain></SENT>
