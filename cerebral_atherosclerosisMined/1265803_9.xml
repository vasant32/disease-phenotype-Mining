<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SHRSP on a hypercholesterolemic diet (20% suet, 5% cholesterol, and 2% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16359">cholic acid</z:chebi>) had ring-like fat deposits in the circle of Willis, which were detected within a few weeks by new techniques for the macroscopical demonstration of fat deposits "as a whole" and were proved to be good quantitative indices for the initiation of atherogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experimental studies using more than 200 rats including SHRSP, experimental hypertensive rats (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035085" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal infarction</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>) and WK rats, fed a hypercholesterolemic diet with 1% salt in the drinking water for 1 week, 2 weeks, 10 weeks and more than 10 weeks, revealed that the arterial fat deposition in the brain was affected by BP, serum cholesterol level, strain difference and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High BP was confirmed to be more important than the other factors by the quantitative analysis of sudanophilic rings in relation to BP </plain></SENT>
