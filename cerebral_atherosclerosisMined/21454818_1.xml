<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> (ICAS) in patients with recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is associated with a high risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More insight into the pathophysiology of ICAS could help identify patients at high risk requiring more aggressive secondary prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the prevalence, distribution, calcification, and the risk factors predisposing ICAS in a European <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (n=786) were evaluated for the presence and distribution of ICAS (â‰¥30% <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing) by CT angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ICAS were categorized as symptomatic or asymptomatic, and the presence of calcification was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association of traditional cerebrovascular risk factors and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate with ICAS was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 178 of 786 patients (23%), 288 ICAS were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most stenoses (n=194/288; 67%) were located in the posterior circulation arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 59 of 786 patients (8%), ICAS were considered symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ICAS in the basilar artery and arteries beyond the circle of Willis were mainly noncalcified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition to age, gender, and several traditional cerebrovascular risk factors, erythrocyte sedimentation rate was independently associated with the presence of ICAS (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.06-1.36) and with the presence of noncalcified ICAS in particular (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.05-1.37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ICAS was observed in a noteworthy number of European <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Particularly, the majority of ICAS was observed in the posterior circulation, possibly conferring worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ICAS in distal arteries were mainly noncalcified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Association of noncalcified ICAS and erythrocyte sedimentation rate may indicate a prominent role for inflammatory factors in intracranial atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
