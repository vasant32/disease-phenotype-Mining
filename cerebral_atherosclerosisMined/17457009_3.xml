<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study the relationship between the degree of cerebrovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> and cerebral oxygenation during exercise was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 109 patients (69 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, 40 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152105" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypertensive heart disease</z:e>) (61.7+/-9.7 years) performed a symptom-limited exercise test with respiratory gas measurements (CPX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From the respiratory gas analysis, peak <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> uptake (VO(2)), the slope of the increase in VO(2) to the increase in work rate (DeltaVO (2)/DeltaWR), and the slope of the increase in ventilation to the increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> output (VE/VCO(2) slope) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">Oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> (O(2)Hb) at the forehead was monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The brain ischemic score was counted based upon fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images of magnetic resonance imaging and expressed from 0 to 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When compared with patients with a lower ischemic score (&lt;2, n=67), those with a higher ischemic score (&gt; or =2, n=42) had a lower increase in brain O(2)Hb during exercise (-1.08 +/-2.7 vs 0.77+/-4.1 micromol/L, p=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of brain ischemic score, left ventricular ejection fraction, peak VO(2), DeltaVO(2)/DeltaWR, and the VE/VCO(2) slope, DeltaVO(2)/ DeltaWR was found to be the sole independent index determining cerebral O(2)Hb during exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CPX parameters were also significantly related to the degree of cerebrovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although cerebral oxygenation during exercise is mainly related to cardiopulmonary function, the degree of cerebrovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> partly influences cerebral oxygenation in patients with risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
