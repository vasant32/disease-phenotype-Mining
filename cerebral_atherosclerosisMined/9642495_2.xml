<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Occasionally, migraineurs report late-life migrainous accompaniments, i.e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0011157'>auras</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, particularly when typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> attacks terminate or diminish following major or minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, at which time the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011157'>auras</z:hpo> may become atypical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical observations such as these suggest that degenerative cerebrovascular changes accompanying aging may modify the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine headaches</z:hpo> particularly those with aura </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we quantitated age-related changes in cerebral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> capacitance by measuring local cerebral blood flow utilizing <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> contrast computed tomography (CT) scanning before and after oral administration of the pharmacological cerebral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements were compared among 27 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (aged 24-94 years; mean age 61.1 +/- 17.6) and 37 carefully categorized groups of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> patients (aged 27-83 years; mean age 59.4 +/- 12.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> comprised Group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Migraineurs were divided into two subgroups: Group B consisted of 27 migraineurs with and without aura who continued to suffer from incapacitating and frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and Group C consisted of 10 migraineurs who no longer suffered from severe and frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, two of whom still complained of atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011157'>auras</z:hpo> of the "late-life migrainous accompaniments" type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> capacitance significantly declined with advancing age among <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> and the two groups of migraineurs, confirming the development of age-related cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Global CBF increases after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi> in Group B (with persistent and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>), were significantly greater compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, and with Group C consisting of migraineurs whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> had decreased, subsided, or become replaced by late-life migrainous accompaniments (Group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results establish that cerebrovasodilator capacitance declines with advancing age, probably due to progressive cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, since these declines were accentuated by risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> or documented lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> by CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Progressive impairments of cerebral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> capacitance among migraineurs were associated with: (i) reductions in frequency and severity of migrainous cephalalgia and (ii) appearance of late-life migrainous accompaniments </plain></SENT>
