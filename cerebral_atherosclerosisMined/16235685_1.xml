<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Oxidation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> is inhibited by endogenous radical scavenging enzymes such as <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and Cu-ZnSOD that catalyze dismutation of oxygen to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors evaluated whether a focal imbalance between pro- and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> systems induces plaque vulnerability in patients with carotid artery (CA) stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Carotid artery plaques obtained in 35 patients who had undergone carotid endarterectomy were classified as vulnerable or stable based on histopathological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vulnerable plaques, OxLDL, measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.01) and SOD activity significantly lower than in stable plaques (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The plaque and plasma OxLDL levels were inversely correlated with plaque SOD activity (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The physiological <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> level in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> plaques was one fourth to one eighth of that in plasma and appeared to be unable to protect Cu-ZnSOD from degradation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis showed increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> and OxLDL in vulnerable plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between plaque and plasma OxLDL levels (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the results suggests that a focal imbalance between pro- and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defense systems in patients with CA plaques induces an increase in plaque OxLDL levels and consequent plaque instability, contributing to high levels of plasma OxLDL </plain></SENT>
