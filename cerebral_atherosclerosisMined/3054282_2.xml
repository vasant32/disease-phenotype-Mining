<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The segments of the carotid arteries examined on both sides of the neck were the A. carotis communis, the A. carotis interna, and A carotis externa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a result plaques were found in 330 subjects (23.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of plaques in subjects is strongly correlated to age (increasing trend in both sexes, P less than 0.001) and the process of establishing plaques starts in men earlier than in women (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For both sexes a different correlation structures is found for the relationship of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> to presence of plaques as well as to number of plaques in the carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In men, total cholesterol (P less than 0.05) and personal history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (P less than 0.01) were positively correlated with the presence of plaques while <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>/total cholesterol ratio shows a negative correlation (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In women, none of the analyzed risk factors is found to correlate significantly with the presence of plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regarding the number of vessels with plaques, a consistent and significant relationship with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and total cholesterol is seen in males and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparing the different factors analyzed, age is obviously much more related to the occurrence of plaques than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the other risk factors together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age is followed by a decrease in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and, at a much lower level, by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and smoking </plain></SENT>
