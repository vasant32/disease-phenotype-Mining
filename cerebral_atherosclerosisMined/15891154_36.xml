<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although digital subtraction angiography (DSA) provides excellent visualization of the intracranial vasculature, it has several limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to evaluate the ability of helical CT angiography (CTA) to help detect and quantify intracranial stenosis and occlusion compared with DSA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (MRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-eight patients underwent CTA, DSA, and 3D time-of-flight (TOF) MRA for suspected cerebrovascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three studies were performed within a 30-day period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two readers blinded to prior estimated or calculated stenoses, patient history and clinical information examined 672 vessel segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesions were categorized as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (0-9%), mild (10-29%), moderate (30-69%), severe (70-99%), or occluded (no flow detected) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DSA was the reference standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unblinded consensus readings were obtained for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> discrepancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 115 diseased vessel segments were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After consensus interpretation, CTA revealed higher sensitivity than that of MRA for intracranial stenosis (98% versus 70%, P &lt; .001) and occlusion (100% versus 87%, P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CTA had a higher positive predictive value than that of MRA for both stenosis (93% versus 65%, P &lt; .001) and occlusion (100% versus 59%, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CTA had a high interoperator reliability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 6 of 28 patients (21%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 with low-flow states in the posterior circulation, CTA was superior to DSA in detection of vessel patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CTA has a higher sensitivity and positive predictive value than MRA and is recommended over TOF MRA for detection of intracranial stenosis and occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CTA has a high interoperator reliability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CTA is superior to DSA in the evaluation of posterior circulation steno-occlusive disease when slow flow is present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CTA results had a significant effect on patient clinical management </plain></SENT>
