<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Culture of the organism from arterial tissue has been difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the use of a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to detect viable Chlamydia pneumoniae in carotid atheromas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 30 patients (14 females, mean age 69.6 +/- 8.8 years) who underwent surgery for the removal of atherosclerotic plaques from carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During surgery, samples of lingual vein and superior thyroideal artery were also taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We applied two molecular biology techniques to the carotid plaques on lingual vein or thyroideal artery samples: 1) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 2) reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) for the detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, employing PCR primers designed to detect a fragment of the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26833">16S</z:chebi> rRNA gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were obtained from the patients for determination of Chlamydia pneumoniae IgG, IgA, and IgM antibody titers by a microimmunofluorescence technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study confirmed the presence of viable Chlamydia pneumoniae in atheromas and support the hypothesis that the organism may be an active factor in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
