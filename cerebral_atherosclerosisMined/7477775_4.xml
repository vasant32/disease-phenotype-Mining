<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elevated serum levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a) (Lp[a]), are an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured serum Lp(a) levels in 50 patients who had angiographically proven saccular aneurysmal disease and who were free of clinically significant atheromatous disease (as judged by their medical histories and the results of physical examination, electrocardiography, and carotid angiography) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Lp(a) serum levels in these patients were compared with the Lp(a) serum levels in a group of 42 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum Lp(a) levels in the patients was 20.1 +/- 0.42 mg/dl (median +/- standard error); however, median serum Lp(a) in the control subjects was 10.8 +/- 0.47 mg/dl (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among females, the difference in serum Lp(a) levels was significant; the levels were 22.2 +/- 0.6 for female patients (n = 29) and 9.5 +/- 0.53 in female control subjects (n = 26) (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most significant difference (P &lt; 0.002) was seen in females &lt; 50 years old (14 patients, 10 control subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were seen in the Lp(a) serum levels between 21 male patients and 16 male control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lp(a) levels above the threshold level (30 mg/dl) were found in 20 patients and 7 control subjects (chi 2 = 5.99, P &lt; 0.02); 12 female patients and 3 female control subjects (chi 2 = 6.16, P &lt; 0.02; 8 male patients and 4 male control subjects (this difference was not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate either that cerebrovascular aneurysmal disease and subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> are related or that Lp(a) is a risk factor for vasculopathies other than atheroma </plain></SENT>
