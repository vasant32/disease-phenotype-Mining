<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the clinical value of MRI perfusion imaging in the periprocedural management of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, analyzing if changes in mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) correlated with angiographic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pre-procedural and post-procedural MRI perfusion was performed on six patients who underwent angioplasty and/or stenting for symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>, CBV and CBF were analyzed and graded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 83% of patients, perfusion imaging correlated with angiographic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perfusion parameters improved to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two showed marked improvement and one showed mild improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one patient, the results of the post-procedural MRI perfusion prompted an angiogram, which confirmed stent occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Semi-quantitative scores of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and CBF changed over time (p=0.05, p=0.03) whereas CBV did not change significantly (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that MRI perfusion appears a promising technique for analyzing the impact of intracranial stenosis on cerebral hemodynamics before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
