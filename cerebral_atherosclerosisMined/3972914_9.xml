<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the mean CBF and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) values between the two populations; i.e., these important parameters did not fall with chronological aging per se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in the mean cerebral metabolic rate for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (CMRG) value (by approximately 23%) in the aged compared with the young </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Newer methods using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography and appropriate isotopes have confirmed these findings in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aging in human subjects and experimental animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As expected, MABP and cerebral vascular resistance (CVR) were significantly elevated in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MABP was even more elevated in elderly hypertensive subjects, and the CVR more elevated in the subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> (Group II), who also showed a small but significant fall in CBF and in internal jugular venous <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CBF showed a more pronounced fall in senile aged patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1446648" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain syndrome</z:e> (Group III), in whom the CMRO2 also showed a marked drop (by approximately 22%); the CMRG fell still further (approximately 40% of that in the young) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the few aged subjects followed up after a lapse of 11 years by a repeat estimation of the same physiological and psychological parameters and of the EEG, most showed clear worsening, together with a fall in overall physical and intellectual performance, probably related to a rise in CVR and an increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> with aging.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
