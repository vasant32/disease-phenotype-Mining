<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In this retrospective study we wanted to determine the role of cerebral revascularization in patients with symptomatic occlusive cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Special emphasis was put on subsequent cerebrovascular events, benefit in neurological functioning and bypass patency, as evaluated during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODs: A total of 73 superficial temporal artery to the middle cerebral artery bypasses were performed on 67 patients from 1986-2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients exhibited a symptomatic occlusion of the internal carotid artery verified by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients in our group were refractory to medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>65 patients (69 bypasses) with a mean age of 61 years (range: 38-79 years) were followed up over an average time of 44 months (range: 1.5-150 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The peri-operative morbidity rate was 3% with no mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>55 patients (85%) had no further cerebrovascular events after surgery, and only 7 (11%) patients experienced another cerebrovascular event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>57 (88%) patients showed an improvement of symptoms after surgery and only 1 patient fared worse during the follow-up period due to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> he suffered two years after bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>90% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> bypasses remained patent during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although bypass surgery for occlusive cerebrovascular disease is still controversial, our retrospective study suggests both an improvement of symptoms and signs and a risk-reduction for future cerebrovascular events after surgery </plain></SENT>
