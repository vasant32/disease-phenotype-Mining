<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-two clinically symptomatic patients with 42 hemodynamically significant intracranial lesions (&gt;70% stenosis) were treated by PTCBA between January 1992 and May 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before treatment, the patients were assigned to three groups according to the angiographic characteristics of the lesions, as follows: type A, short (5 mm or less in length) concentric or moderately eccentric lesions less than totally occlusive; type B, tubular (5 to 10 mm in length), extremely eccentric or totally occluded lesions, less than 3 months old; and type C, diffuse (more than 10 mm in length), extremely angulated (&gt;90 degrees) lesions with excessive tortuosity of the proximal segment, or totally occluded lesions, and 3 months old or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed up for a period of 1 month to 6 years to compare the results of PTCBA treatment among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary end points were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The clinical success rates for the type A, B, and C groups were 92%, 86%, and 33%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cumulative risks of fatal or nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or ipsilateral bypass surgery in type A, B, and C groups were 8%, 26%, and 87%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative risk of 8% among patients in the type A group appeared to be smaller than in studies reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PTCBA for intracranial simple (type A) lesions yields a favorable clinical outcome for symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
