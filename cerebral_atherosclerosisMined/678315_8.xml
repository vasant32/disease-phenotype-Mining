<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Permeability to horseradish peroxidase was enhanced at the edge of intimal cushions without foam cell accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that permeability is increased before foam cell infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No foam cell lesions were observed in the intima of cerebral arteries distant from branching sites, but insudation of plasma constituents here caused endothelial cells to separate from the subendothelial matrices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Foam cell lesions were absent from the cerebral arteries in normotensive cholesterol-fed rabbits </plain></SENT>
