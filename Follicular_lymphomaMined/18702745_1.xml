<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Males with the disorder are usually in good health until contracting Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) whereupon the majority of patients die from fulminant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086438" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypogammaglobulinaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report describes a female carrier with an XLP phenotype who was retrospectively identified after her grandson died from the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequent genetic testing identified the patient's mother and affected maternal grandmother as XLP carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The family's medical records were significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proband had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at ages 2 and 8 and made a full recovery following treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both the maternal grandmother and uncle died of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We were concerned that the XLP carrier mother may be predisposed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> if the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> X chromosome is skewed towards inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The human <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor assay detected random X chromosome inactivation in the carrier mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EBV was not detected in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissues of the proband and his grandmother, confirming previous findings that EBV is not always associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in XLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More significantly, our study highlights the importance of identifying XLP in families with a high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
