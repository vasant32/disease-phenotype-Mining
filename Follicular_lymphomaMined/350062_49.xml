<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of corresponding cellular composition have been shown to arise from follicular center cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper describes a rare functional and morphological expression of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> arising from follicular center cells, namely, immunoglobulin production, an observation for which no detailed description or nanlysis is available in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the unusual signet ring-like appearance of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, which is due to retention of immunoglobulins within the cytoplasm, may result in an erroneous interpretation of metastatic <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0012034'>liposarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we are presenting a detailed analysis of light microscopic, histochemical, immunocytochemical, and ultrastructural observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven patients in our series showed nodular growth patterns; in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one, diffuse areas were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were classified as poorly differentiated lymphocytic type and two as mixed cell type, according to Rappaport's classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In four of the seven patients, the majority of the neoplastic cells had a clear vacuolated cytoplasm, and in three of these cases, a few of the neoplastic cells showed immunoperoxidase positivity for monoclonal IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This group in particular closely simulated metastatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> composed of so-called signet ring cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the remaining three cases, most of the neoplastic cells contained <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-positive, Russell body-like monoclonal IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructurally, the monoclonal IgG appeared as even-sized electron-dense spherules or irregular electron-dense clumps, while the monoclonal IgM appeared as membrane bound, homogeneous, electron-dense material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The implications of these findings and the morphologic features which are helpful in the identification of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are discussed </plain></SENT>
