<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deletions at the 9p21 region frequently affect both p16 and p15 genes, however, mutations in the coding sequence of the p15 gene have not been found in the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> analyzed, including non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abnormal methylation of the promoter region of p15 has been recently described as an alternative mechanism of inactivation of this gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 72 non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) for methylation at p15 exon 1 by PCR and Southern blot techniques using methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abnormal methylation was found in eight cases (11%), most of them (three MALT, one anaplastic T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, one Burkitt and one follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) showing hypermethylation in the p16 gene also </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, two pleomorphic T cell NHL showed a selective methylation at p15 gene, while the p16 gene remained unmethylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results show that methylation at the p15 gene is frequently associated with p16 methylation in NHL, and suggest that selective methylation of p15, although uncommon, could be a specific alteration implicated in T cell NHL </plain></SENT>
