<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2 gene, encoding a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane protein suggested to play an important role in cell survival, is translocated into the Ig loci in about 80% of human follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, which results in a high level of expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report shows that bcl-2 was expressed in eight of eight human <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> cell lines and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymph node and bone marrow plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the majority of the <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> lines, the level of expression was comparable with that observed in Karpas 422, a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line carrying a 14;18 translocation of the bcl-2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA rearrangements of the bcl-2 locus were evident in only one of the <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines, U-266-1970 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this cell line, which exhibited the highest bcl-2 expression, a fourfold increased copy number of the bcl-2 gene was estimated by Southern analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This amplification was lost in cells of later passages (U-266-1984), suggesting that bcl-2 might possibly have played a role in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results are in contrast to previous observations in murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo>, in which bcl-2 was shown to be silent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results also contradict the published observation that bcl-2 is not expressed at terminal stages of B-cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is at present unclear whether the high expression of bcl-2 in human <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> is the result of a deregulated expression associated with the malignant phenotype or a mere reflection of the bcl-2 expression typical of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma cells </plain></SENT>
