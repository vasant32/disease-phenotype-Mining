<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A group of genes are highly expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> germinal center (GC) B cells and GC B-cell-derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> based on cDNA microarray analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two new genes, GCET1 (germinal center B-cell expressed transcript 1) and GCET2, were cloned from selected expressed sequence tags (IMAGE clone 1334260 and 814622, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GCET1 is located on chromosome 14q32 and has four splicing isoforms, of which the longest one is 1787 bp and encodes a 435-amino acid protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GCET2 is located on 3q13.13, and the cloned fragment is 3270 bp, which encodes a protein of 178 amino acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blast search showed that GCET1 has a highly conserved <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48353">serine proteinase inhibitor</z:chebi> (SERPIN) domain and is located on a chromosomal locus containing seven other SERPIN family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GCET2 is a likely homologue of the mouse gene M17, a GC-expressed transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the GCET2 protein sequence indicated that it may be involved in signal transduction in the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Northern blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses confirmed that GCET1 is highly restricted to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GC B cells and GCB-cell-derived cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although GCET2 is also a useful marker for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic GC B cells, it has a wider range of expression including immature B and T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Real-time polymerase chain reaction assay showed that both GCET1 and GCET2 are preferentially expressed in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with GC B-cell differentiation, confirming previous microarray gene expression analysis, but neither one is entirely specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multiple markers are necessary to differentiate the GCB from the activated B-cell type of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with a high degree of accuracy </plain></SENT>
