<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetics, Southern blotting, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are commonly used techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is generally believed that the vast majority of the breakpoints occurs on chromosome 18 in the major breakpoint region (mbr) and the minor cluster region (mcr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Yet, by improving long-distance PCR protocols we identified half of the breakpoints outside of these clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our study included biopsies from 59 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy-one percent carried translocations detectable with our long-distance PCR protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The novel primer sets were derived from the hitherto uncharacterized 25-kb-long stretch between mbr and mcr that we have sequenced for this purpose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the novel breakpoints reveals a wide distribution between mbr and mcr displaying some clustering 16 kb downstream from the BCL2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By including a primer for this intermediate cluster region in standard PCRs we could also improve the detection of t(14;18) translocations in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our new PCRs are highly sensitive, easy to perform, and thus well suited for routine analysis of t(14;18) translocations for the primary diagnosis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and surveillance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
