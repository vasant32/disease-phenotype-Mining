<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A phase 1 study of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> combined with rituximab, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, modified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (R-CHOP) was conducted in patients with untreated follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) and other indolent NHLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nineteen patients, including 10 patients with FL, were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median patient age was 59 years (range, 29-71 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had a FL International Prognostic Index score â‰¥3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>R-CHOP with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> dose capped at 1.5 mg was administered on a 21-day cycle for 6 to 8 cycles, and 1 of 3 dose levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> (1.0 mg/m(2) [n = 1], 1.3 mg/m(2) [n = 6], or 1.6 mg/m(2) [n = 12]) was administered on days 1 and 8 of each cycle using a Bayesian algorithm for dose escalation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> with modified R-CHOP was reached at 1.6 mg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dose-limiting toxicity was observed in 5 patients (1 patient at a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> dose of 1.0 mg/m(2), 1 patient at a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> dose of 1.3 mg/m(2), and 3 patients at a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> dose of 1.6 mg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neuropathy</z:e> occurred in 16 patients (84%), including 2 patients (11%) who experienced grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>sensory neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Grade 4 hematologic toxicity occurred in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 19 evaluable patients, 100% responded, and the complete response rate was 68% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 32 months, the 3-year progression-free survival rate was 89.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">Bortezomib</z:chebi> combined with modified R-CHOP produced high response rates without substantial increases in toxicity </plain></SENT>
