<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With respect to international prognostic index, 83.8% (31/37) were of score 0 to 2 and 16.2% (6/37) were of score 3 and more than 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The axillary lymph nodes of 21 patients (53.8%, 21/39) were involved by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(2) Histologically, 38 cases (95.0%, 38/40) were classified as B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> [including 27 cases (67.5%) of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 8 cases (20.0%) of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 2 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 1 case of lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The remaining cases included one case of peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and one case of lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, expression of CD20+/- CD79a were demonstrated in the 38 cases (95.0%) of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The staining for CK was negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In 33 cases, the positive rates of MUM-1, bcl-6 and bcl-2 were 57.6% (19/33), 30.3% (10/33) and 72.7% (24/33), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Three cases were germinal center B <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> and 21 cases were non-germinal center B <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
