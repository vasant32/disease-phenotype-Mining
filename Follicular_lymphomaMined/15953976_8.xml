<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Tobacco-use data were collected during in-person interviews in a population-based case-control study of NHL (N=1593 patients, N=2515 controls) conducted in the San Francisco Bay Area between 1988 and 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) for HIV-negative participants were obtained from adjusted unconditional logistic regression models stratified by sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NHL was not associated with overall tobacco use, intensity or duration of cigarette smoking in women or men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, ORs were increased for NHL among men who used any non-cigarette tobacco alone (OR=1.7), non-cigarette tobacco and cigarettes (OR=1.4), multiple types of non-cigarette tobacco alone (OR=2.1) and smokeless tobacco alone (OR=4.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In analyses stratified by sex and age, ORs for NHL associated with cigarette smoking in general were above unity among those aged &gt; or =60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ORs for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were increased in men who used cigarettes and other tobacco, cigars alone and smokeless tobacco alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in men was associated with use of cigarettes and other tobacco, and multiple types of non-cigarette tobacco </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data do not support an association between overall tobacco use and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL in women or men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further analyses are warranted in larger studies to evaluate non-cigarette tobacco use, tobacco-related biologic markers and genetic factors in the development of NHL </plain></SENT>
