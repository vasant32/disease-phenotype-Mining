<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 5.8 years, the overall survival at 8 years is 83% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analysis showed no correlation between FcgammaRIIIA-158VV/VF and FcgammaRIIA-131HH/HR polymorphisms and the overall response rate, the molecular response and the event-free survival obtained after CHOP and Rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the achievement of a durable molecular clearance of BCL2/IgH+ cells detectable in the bone marrow is confirmed to be a reliable predictive factor of a better long-term clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
