<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Before the implementation of the WHO <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> classification system, disagreement about pathologic diagnosis was common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to estimate the impact of expert review in the modern era by comparing final <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1513672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathologic diagnoses</z:e> at five comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> centers with diagnoses assigned at referring centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients in the National Comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Network (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29308,30347">NCCN</z:chebi>) non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) database with a documented pathologic diagnosis before presentation and a final pathologic diagnosis of any of five common B-cell NHLs were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After central review of discordant cases, we estimated the rate of pathologic concordance, then investigated the etiology of discordance as well its potential impact on prognosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall pathologic discordance rate was 6% (43 of 731 patients; 95% CI, 4% to 8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the majority of cases in which the referring diagnosis was apparently final, no additional studies were conducted at the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29308,30347">NCCN</z:chebi> center, and the change in diagnosis reflected a different interpretation of existing data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concordance was highest for diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (95%) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL; grades 1, 2, and not otherwise specified, 95%) and lowest for grade 3 FL (88%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 43 pathologically discordant cases, 81% (35 patients) might have experienced a change in treatment as a result of the pathologic reclassification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the era of the WHO <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> classification system, the majority of common B-cell NHLs diagnosed in the community were unchanged by second opinion review by an expert hematopathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, for one patient in 20, there was a discordance in diagnosis that could have altered therapy </plain></SENT>
