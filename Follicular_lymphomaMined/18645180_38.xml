<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Plant-made vaccines have been the subject of intense interest because they can be produced economically in large scale without the use of animal-derived components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plant-made therapeutic vaccines against challenging <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, have received little research attention, and no previous human clinical trials have been conducted in this vaccine category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We document the feasibility of using a plant <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> expression system to produce personalized (patient-specific) recombinant idiotype vaccines against follicular B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the results of administering these vaccines to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients in a phase I safety and immunogenicity clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The system allowed rapid production and recovery of idiotypic single-chain antibodies (scFv) derived from each patient's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and immunization of patients with their own individual therapeutic antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both low and high doses of vaccines, administered alone or co-administered with the adjuvant GM-CSF, were well tolerated with no serious adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A majority (&gt;70%) of the patients developed cellular or humoral immune responses, and 47% of the patients developed antigen-specific responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because 15 of 16 vaccines were glycosylated in plants, this study also shows that variation in patterns of antigen glycosylation do not impair the immunogenicity or affect the safety of the vaccines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these findings support the conclusion that plant-produced idiotype vaccines are feasible to produce, safe to administer, and a viable option for idiotype-specific immune therapy in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
