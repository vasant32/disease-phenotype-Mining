<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical expression of classical protein kinase C (cPKC) subspecies (alpha, beta and gamma) in eight reactive lymphoid tissues, three <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> spleens and 149 non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>cPKC beta was observed primarily in the mantle zone B cells, but appeared as very faint staining in Ki-67 positive proliferated B cells in the germinal centers of secondary lymph follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the reactive state, high levels of cPKC subspecies were recognized in the majority of 149 cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, including those thought to have arisen from germinal center cells such as follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of cPKC alpha was found in higher frequency in T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> than B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.01) by the Chi-squared test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High levels of cPKC alpha were present only in high grade or highly aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, showing the highest incidence in the small non-cleaved cell type, according to the International Working Formulation and National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>cPKC gamma was not detected in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid cells and was expressed in only four cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is presumed that cPKC alpha and beta have a relationship to cell activation and proliferation of lymphoid cells of reactive and neoplastic states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It might be considered that the expression of cPKC alpha may have a relationship with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> in non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
