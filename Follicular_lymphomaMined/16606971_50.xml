<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> (1.3 mg/m2) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 3-week cycle </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were heavily pretreated with a median of four previous therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant grade 3 to 4 toxicities were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (n = 22), <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (n = 10), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> responded to treatment (one complete response, six partial responses [PRs]; overall response rate, 29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients with FL achieved a late PR 3 months after discontinuing therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients with Waldenstr√∂m's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024419" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">macroglobulinemia</z:e> and one patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> achieved a PR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> primary cultures demonstrated greater sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> than FL (median 50% effective concentration for viability, 209 nmol/L v 1,311 nmol/L, respectively; P = .07), which correlated with clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A median reduction in plasma TNF-alpha of 98% was observed in six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> who responded to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> compared with a reduction of 38% in six nonresponders (P = .07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">Bortezomib</z:chebi> demonstrates encouraging efficacy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> in heavily pretreated individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Response was associated with a reduction in plasma TNF-alpha and in vitro sensitivity in a small number of patients </plain></SENT>
