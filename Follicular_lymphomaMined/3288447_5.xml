<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two hundred fifty-six contiguous microscopic fields were analysed, and a cellular map was automatically constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The resulting images were stored on magnetic media for subsequent quantification and statistical tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The method was applied to the analysis of 20 small cleaved-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in which the monoclonal antibody Ki-67 was used to mark proliferating cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clusters of proliferative cells were observed in both diffuse and nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cellularity and the percentage of marked cells were not significantly different in the two types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
