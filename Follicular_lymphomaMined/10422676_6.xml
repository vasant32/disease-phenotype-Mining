<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Involvement of the cervix as part of a systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is more common than primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but the cervix as the site of presentation is unusual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report two cases of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the cervix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first patient, a 52-year-old woman, was referred to colposcopy following persistent low grade dyskaryosis on cervical cytology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At colposcopy a Lletz biopsy was performed and a diagnosis of CIN 1 and focal CIN 2 was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition the subepithelial zone revealed a non-Hodgkin's (NHL) B-cell follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was subsequently staged as NHL Stage 3E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The second patient, a 35-year-old woman, was referred to the gynaecology department with a history of abnormal vaginal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and two abnormal smears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subsequent cervical biopsy revealed a high grade, large cell, malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, diffuse, B-cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patient was staged as Stage IE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the uterine cervix as illustrated in the second case is very unusual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One case had negative cytology and one case had abnormal cells of uncertain origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This highlights the difficulty of diagnosing cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, a rare but treatable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, on cytology and suggests that cervical biopsy is needed for the confirmation of the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
