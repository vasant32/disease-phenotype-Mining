<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was shown that 75% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had clear expression of both Bcl-2 protein and Fas antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> may have a growth advantage due to their high expression of Bcl-2 protein, which tended to impede <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> mediated by Fas antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed various patterns; 28% were double positive, 16% were only Bcl-2 protein-positive, 28% were only Fas antigen-positive, and 28% were double negative or equivocal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytocidal assay of seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines using anti-human Fas monoclonal antibody revealed that overexpression of Bcl-2 protein tended to impede <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> mediated by Fas antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, this inhibitory effect of Bcl-2 protein was incomplete and its effect might be dependent upon cell type </plain></SENT>
