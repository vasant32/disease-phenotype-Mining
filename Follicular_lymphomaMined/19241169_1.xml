<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined 29 patients with primary GI <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> by oral and anal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBEs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathologic features related to the prevalence of diminutive small bowel involvement and the clinical outcome were retrospectively investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diminutive small bowel lesions were found in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of the lesions was not different between patients with primary small bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and those with primary extra-small bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (50% versus 47%, P = 0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, clinical stage was more advanced in patients with the lesions than in those without (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lesions were more frequently found in T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (100%) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (77%) than in the other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (15%) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diminutive small intestinal lesions occur in patients with GI <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, especially in those with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GI <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of these histologic types are candidates for scrutiny by <z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBE</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
