<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we use a novel bioinformatic based integrative genomic profiling approach to elucidate conserved mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> in the three commonest non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) entities: diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By integrating genome-wide DNA copy number analysis and transcriptome profiling of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cohorts, we identified genetic lesions present in each entity and highlighted their likely target genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This revealed a significant enrichment of components of both the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathway and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> activated protein kinase pathway, including amplification of the MAP3K12 locus in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three entities, within the set of genes targeted by genetic alterations in these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, amplification of 12p13.33 was identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three entities and found to target the FOXM1 oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Amplification of FOXM1 was subsequently found to be associated with an increased MYC oncogenic signaling signature, and siRNA-mediated knock-down of FOXM1 resulted in decreased MYC expression and induced G2 arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together, these findings underscore genetic alteration of the MAPK and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathways, and genetic amplification of FOXM1 as conserved mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> in common NHL entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Integrative genomic profiling identifies common central survival mechanisms and highlights them as attractive targets for directed therapy </plain></SENT>
