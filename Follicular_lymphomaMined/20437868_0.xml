<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to compare the predictive value of B2M, FLIPI and other prognostic factors not included in the FLIPI index for overall survival (OS), complete remission (CR), and time to treatment failure (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi>) in a nonselected follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective univariate and multivariate analysis of the prognostic value (for OS, CR, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi>) of B2M, FLIPI and other prognostic variables in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was conducted in a cohort of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients between 1987 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and six patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis B2M and B symptoms were significantly associated with OS, and FLIPI only detected two risk levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis of OS only two significant variables were found: FLIPI and B2M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis of CR showed that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B2M, absence of a bulky mass, uninvolved bone marrow, and chemotherapy with rituximab were significant predictors of CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FLIPI (three levels), B2M, bone marrow infiltration, and chemotherapy with rituximab were significantly associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found a high predictive value of B2M for OS, CR, and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>B2M and FLIPI were the most important variables to predict OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in our series FLIPI differentiated only between two mortality risk levels </plain></SENT>
