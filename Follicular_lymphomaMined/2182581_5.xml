<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Based on earlier clinical and preclinical investigations, we designed two different pilot trials for patients with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These studies evaluated the use of either 41.8 degrees C whole body <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> (WBH), or the nonmyelosuppressive chemotherapeutic drug, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50138">lonidamine</z:chebi> (LON), as an adjunct to total body irradiation (TBI) (12.5 cGy twice a week, every other week for a planned total dose of 150 cGy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whole body <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> was initiated approximately 10 min after total body irradiation; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50138">lonidamine</z:chebi> was administered orally (420 mg/m2) on a daily basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although entry to the studies was nonrandomized, the two patient populations were accrued during the same time frame and were comparable in terms of histology, stage of disease, performance status, and prior therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 8 patients entered on the TBI/WBH study, we observed 3 complete responses (CR), 4 partial responses (PR), and 1 improvement (i.e., a 48% decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 10 patients entered in the TBI/LON study, there was 1 CR and 4 PR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the TBI/WBH study, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> was not treatment-limiting; there were no instances of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and platelet support was never required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival time for the TBI/WBH study is 52.5 months based on Kaplan Meir estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients remain in a CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median time to treatment failure (MTTF) is 9.4 months (90% confidence interval = 7-15.4 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the TBI/LON study, 50% of patients receiving TBI required treatment modification due to platelet-count <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> during therapy, but there were no instances of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Frequently observed LON-related toxicities included <z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>myalgias</z:hpo>, testicular pain, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000613'>photophobia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235280" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ototoxicity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For the TBI/LON study, median survival is 7.6 months; MTTF was 2.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In analyzing the results of these pilot studies, our subjective clinical impressions lead to the hypothesis that WBH protected against TBI-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> during therapy, whereas LON had no effect on TBI-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This speculation was tested and confirmed in a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments </plain></SENT>
