<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and pharmacodynamics (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> (previously known as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">PS-341</z:chebi>) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1335724" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">refractory hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">PS-341</z:chebi> twice weekly for 4 weeks at either 0.40, 1.04, 1.20, or 1.38 mg/m(2), followed by a 2-week rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">PS-341</z:chebi> was evaluated by measurement of whole blood 20S proteasome activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients received 293 doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">PS-341</z:chebi>, including 24 complete cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DLTs at doses above the 1.04-mg/m(2) MTD attributed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">PS-341</z:chebi> included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, and malaise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In three of 10 patients receiving additional therapy, serious reversible adverse events appeared during cycle 2, including one episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>postural hypotension</z:hpo>, one systemic hypersensitivity reaction, and grade 4 transaminitis in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C and a substantial acetaminophen ingestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> studies revealed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">PS-341</z:chebi> induced 20S proteasome inhibition in a time-dependent manner, and this inhibition was also related to both the dose in milligrams per meter squared, and the absolute dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">PS-341</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among nine fully assessable patients with heavily pretreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1136084" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">plasma cell dyscrasias</z:e> completing one cycle of therapy, there was one complete response and a reduction in paraprotein levels and/or marrow <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085663" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">plasmacytosis</z:e> in eight others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, one patient with mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and another with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had shrinkage of nodal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">PS-341</z:chebi> was well tolerated at 1.04 mg/m(2) on this dose-intensive schedule, although patients need to be monitored for electrolyte abnormalities and late toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additional studies are indicated to determine whether incorporation of dose/body surface area yields a superior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> model to dosing without normalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">PS-341</z:chebi> showed activity against refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> and possibly non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in this study, and merits further investigation in these populations </plain></SENT>
