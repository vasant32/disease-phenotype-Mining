<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim in this study was to classify breast <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> using the World Health Organization classification and then compare this classification with clinical, histologic, and radiologic findings as well as survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study group included 106 patients with breast <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (105 women and 1 man) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were divided into 2 groups based on extent of disease at initial diagnosis: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e> (n=50) and disseminated disease (n=56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period ranged from 4 to 252 months (median, 49 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (97%) patients presented with a palpable breast mass or masses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the localized group, diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) was most frequent (n=32, 64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the disseminated group, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was most frequent and exclusive to this group (P=0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> occurred in both groups without a significant difference in frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A variety of other types of B-cell and T-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and classical Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involved the breast at much lower frequency; most of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> involved the breast as part of disseminated disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation correlated with radiologic findings: localized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> presented as solitary masses, whereas disseminated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> commonly presented as multifocal masses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in the disease-free survival between patients with localized and disseminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the disseminated group, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> had a worse disease-free survival compared with patients with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
