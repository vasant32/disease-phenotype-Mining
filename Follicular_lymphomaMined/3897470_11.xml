<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A total of 296 evaluable patients with unfavorable categories of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were randomly assigned treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> plus BCNU (BCOP) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> (CHOP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In diffuse histiocytic (DH) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, CHOP produced superior complete (54% v 34%) and total (70% v 46%) response rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the responders to either therapy, no differences were seen in duration of response or survival times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median duration of response has not been reached with follow-up in excess of 50 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In categories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> other than DH (including small-cell, mixed, and nodular histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>), complete (27% v 29%) and total (48% v 54%) responses were similar for BCOP and CHOP, as were durations of response and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that BCOP and CHOP are equivalent regimens for other categories of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CHOP appears preferable for diffuse large-cell categories, since it resulted in greater overall survival in patients with DH <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; this was due to a significantly greater response rate, since patients with DH <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who did respond to BCOP maintained their response and survived as long as did the CHOP responders </plain></SENT>
