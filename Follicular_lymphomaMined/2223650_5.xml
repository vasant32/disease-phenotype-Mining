<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The close association between translocation of the proto-oncogene bcl-2 and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> has been well established in Caucasian patients and the de-regulation of bcl-2 has been implicated in follicular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Similar molecular structural alterations have also been detected in diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with a previous history of a follicular pattern as well as in a smaller proportion of de novo diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is a lower incidence of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate further this phenomenon, we used bcl-2 translocation as a genetic marker of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, to study 31 cases of B cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in Chinese patients by Southern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight out of 16 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed bcl-2 translocation with involvement of the major breakpoint region (MBR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six of these cases utilized breakpoints within the 4.3 kb HindIII fragment, while in two cases the breakpoints were more dispersed, but still within the BamHI fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An additional case of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed translocation of bcl-2 gene with involvement of the minor cluster region (mcr), making a total of nine out of 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the 15 cases of diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed similar molecular structural alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data show that bcl-2 translocation is present in 57% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in Chinese patients, and support the notion that bcl-2 translocation is a consistent marker for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> irrespective of ethnic differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As the translocation is not detected in the diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, there is no evidence to suggest that the low incidence of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in Chinese patients is due to a greater tendency for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0474808" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">follicular tumours</z:e> to progress rapidly and present as diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
