<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation, the genetic hallmark and early initiating event of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) pathogenesis, is also present at low frequency in the peripheral blood of healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has long been assumed that in healthy individuals t(14;18) is carried by circulating quiescent naive B cells, where its oncogenic potential would be restrained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we question this current view and demonstrate that in healthy individuals, t(14;18) is actually carried by an expanding population of atypical B cells issued from germinal centers, displaying genotypic and phenotypic features of FL, and prone to constitute potent premalignant FL niches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings strongly impact both on the current understanding of disease progression and on the proper handling of t(14;18) frequency in blood as a potential early biomarker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
