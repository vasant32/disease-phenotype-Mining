<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used epidemiological data and blood samples of the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) to analyze associations of FL risk factors and t(14;18)-positive cells in HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Buffy coat samples from 4152 study participants were tested by real-time PCR for t(14;18)-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Out of 3966 evaluable subjects, 1526 were t(14;18)-PCR positive (38.5%, median 3.9 t(14;18)-positive per million nucleated cells, range 0.6 - 9299) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analyses age and sex but not parameters of smoking exposure were significantly associated with t(14;18)-prevalence (logistic regression, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analyses of t(14;18)-frequency showed a positive association with age but not with sex or smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These age and sex associations in HI require careful control in future studies of t(14;18) as a potential biomarker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
