<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have evaluated a new set of monoclonal antibodies to kappa and lambda light chains that are reactive in paraffin sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In reactive lymphoid tissues, polytypic staining was noted in greater than 95% of cases, with strong staining of plasma cells, moderate staining of the follicular dendritic cell network, and weak staining of mantle zone cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Strong staining of the appropriate light chain was seen in each of the 7 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a series of 58 cases of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, correlation between the results of immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry was obtained in 36 cases (62%), including 32 cases (21 kappa and 11 lambda) in which a single light chain was expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monotypic staining was also seen in 6 additional cases (10%) in which flow cytometry was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty of 46 cases (65%) of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed monotypic light chain expression, in contrast to 64 of 67 cases (95%) of reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp>, which showed polytypic light chain expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These antibodies may provide an effective adjunct to the diagnosis of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in routine diagnostic work </plain></SENT>
