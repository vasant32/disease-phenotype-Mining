<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We systematically investigated the effects of other established NHL risk factors in relation to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF) G308A or interleukin 10 (IL10) T3575A genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) from 1,172 cases and 982 population-based controls in a U.S. multicenter study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated NHL overall and two common subtypes [diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NHL risks were increased among those with both an autoimmune condition and the TNF G308A GA/AA (OR(NHL), 2.1; 95% CI, 1.0-4.2) or the IL10 T3575A TA/AA genotype (OR(NHL), 1.6; 95% CI, 0.9-2.6) compared with individuals without an autoimmune condition and with the common TNF G308A GG or IL10 T3575A TT genotype, respectively; results were similar for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that elevated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> risk associated with last-born status was more pronounced among those with TNF G308A GA/AA (OR(<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1-6.4) or IL10 T3575A TA/AA (OR(<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), 2.9; 95% CI, 1.6-5.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, elevated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> risk associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (body mass index, &gt; or = 35 versus &lt;25 kg/m(2)) was observed only among those with TNF G308A GA/AA (OR(<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1-5.7) or IL10 T3575A TA/AA genotypes (OR(<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These exploratory results require replication but provide evidence that autoimmune conditions, late birth order, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> act partly through a common inflammatory pathway, posing a greater risk to individuals with variant TNF and IL10 genotypes than those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> alleles </plain></SENT>
