<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The biologic relationship between small B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> (HS) when occurring in the same patient remains unclear, though recent data suggest a possible '<z:mpath ids='MPATH_85'>transdifferentiation</z:mpath>' from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) to HS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the clonal relationship in two cases of small B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with subsequent HS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Case 1: A 62-year-old female with splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e>) developed HS in a groin lymph node 1 year after the primary diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PCR/sequence analysis of the IGH gene showed a monoclonal rearrangement carrying an identical nucleotide sequence of PCR products from the spleen with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e> and the lymph node with HS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case 2: A 61-year-old female with a remote history of FL developed supraclavicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, which was confirmed to be HS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PCR analysis of the HS detected a monoclonal rearrangement of the IGH gene and FISH analysis revealed IGH/BCL2 fusion, a genetic hallmark for FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The transformed HSs showed partial retention of their prior B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>' signatures, including expression of OCT2 in both cases and expression of BCL6 and enhanced expression of BCL2 in case 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both HSs demonstrated hypermutated IGH variable regions, arguing against a common progenitor mechanism of the transformation process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data suggest a common clonal origin of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and subsequent HS occurring in the same patient, indicating that '<z:mpath ids='MPATH_85'>transdifferentiation</z:mpath>' occurs in other small B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, in addition to the previously reported FL or B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with IGH/BCL2 </plain></SENT>
