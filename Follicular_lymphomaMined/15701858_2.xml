<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">Doxorubicin</z:chebi> is often given during the initial treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dosage or drugs chosen for salvage therapy are limited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The R-EPOCT (rituximab with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, pirarubicine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>) regimen, in which less cardiotoxic pirarubicine is used instead of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was administered to 20 patients with relapsed or refractory follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The safety (especially cardiotoxicity) and efficacy of this regimen were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As markers of cardiotoxicity, serum troponin T and plasma B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) levels were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adverse reactions occurred in 14 of the 20 patients and mainly consisted of grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the evaluation of cardiotoxicity, the BNP level was slightly elevated before the treatment in two patients and the BNP level did not significantly increase after R-EPOCT treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The troponin T level was undetectable before and after the treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The response rate was 100%, with complete remission in 16 patients (80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>G-CSF administration increased both Fc gamma receptor type I expression on neutrophils and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the levels of Fc gamma receptor type I expression nor antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity after three or five cycles of the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that the combination of R-EPOCT and G-CSF is well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This regimen was not cardiotoxic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We are planning a randomized trial to compare the efficacy between R-EPOCT and a combination of R-EPOCT with G-CSF </plain></SENT>
