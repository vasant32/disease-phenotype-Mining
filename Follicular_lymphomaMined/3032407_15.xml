<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 2.8-kilobase major breakpoint region on chromosome segment 18q21 is the site of most t(14;18) translocations typical of human follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Breaks are focused at the 5' end of joining (JH) regions of immunoglobulin (Ig) on chromosome 14, indicating that the translocation occurs at a pre-B-cell stage during attempted heavy (H) chain joining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A new gene from 18q21 (Bcl-2) is placed in the H chain locus creating a unique, translocation-specific JH;18q21 rearrangement that presumably represents a transformation event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Ig gene joining occurs in a H before light (L) chain and K before lambda cascade, creating ordered clonal markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These serial markers were examined to determine if variations in Ig gene patterns during the natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> represent the emergence of truly separate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of a single <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We examined 45 serial biopsies from 16 B follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients; six cases showed variation in Ig gene patterns over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven individuals had a detectable JH;18q21 rearrangement present, and it remained unchanged over 5-10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further rearrangements of H chain genes occurred on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome 14 within evolving subclones of the original <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lambda L chains also underwent additional rearrangements in two instances, while K gene patterns remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> variations in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> H and L chain genes were 2 degrees rearrangements occurring at a mature B-cell stage following the initial successful rearrangement of a H and L chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast the t(14;18) breakpoint was conserved in each individual, indicating that evolving neoplastic subpopulations arose from a common clonal progenitor cell </plain></SENT>
