<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Lacrimal gland <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> are usually classified as orbital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334342" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adnexal tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the lacrimal gland is the only orbital structure with native lymphocytes, we examined cases with primary involvement of the gland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 14 cases were selected from a review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases in the surgical pathology files of the Ottawa Hospital between 1992 and 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lesions were categorized according to the latest World Health Organization classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> of lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conducted a clinical, histopathological, immunohistochemical, immunophenotypic and molecular genetic analysis of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 8 female and 6 male patients, aged 20 to 88 (mean 60) years, were followed for an average of 4 years (range 11 months to 13 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> presented with supratemporal orbital swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5 primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), were confined to the lacrimal gland (stage IE); 1 tumour transformed to diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, necessitating chemotherapy, and the other 4 were treated with radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One of the 5 patients had previously had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjögren's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 6 secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (4 follicular) presented either concurrently with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or up to 12 years afterwards and were treated in a variety of ways; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients had an orbital relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the last follow-up assessment, 6 of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had no evidence of disease, 3 were alive with disease, 2 had died (1 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the other with no evidence of disease), and the status of 1 patient was not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 3 patients with reactive proliferations, 2 had reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> (associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjögren's syndrome</z:e> in 1), and 1 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019625" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rosai-Dorfman disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 9 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that underwent molecular genetic analysis were of B-cell lineage, and 8 had a monoclonal rearrangement in the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene (IgH); the 9th <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed an oligoclonal rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed the t(14;18) translocation, typical of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed the t(11;18) translocation, commonly found in MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (but only 2 cases were studied) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Molecular genetic analysis was performed in 2 of the cases of reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp>: monoclonal IgH rearrangement was detected in 1 case (the patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjögren's syndrome</z:e>), oligoclonal rearrangement in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Lacrimal gland <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> that develop in older adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Primary tumours</z:e>, a hIgH proportion of which have MALT characteristics, have a favourable prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Molecular genetic studies may be useful when morphologic and immunophenotypic studies give equivocal results </plain></SENT>
