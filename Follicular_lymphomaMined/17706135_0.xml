<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the clinicopathologic features and differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-like lesions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of uterine cervix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical data and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin-stained slides of 10 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-like lesion and 16 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of uterine cervix were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study for B- and T-cell markers and light chains (kappa, lambda) were performed on paraffin sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rearrangement status of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene was analyzed with semi-nested polymerase chain reaction in 4 cases <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-like lesion and 4 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of uterine cervix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-like lesion ranged from 24 to 54 years (medium = 43 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lesion generally presented with cervical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microscopically, it is characterized by focal or diffuse superficial infiltration of immunoblast-like large B cells intermingled with a polymorphic population of inflammatory cells, including plasma cells, eosinophils and neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maturation of the transformed large B cells was also noticed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the age of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of uterine cervix varied from 28 to 78 years (medium = 58 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cervical mass or diffuse enlargement of cervix were the commonest clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cases included 12 examples of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 4 examples of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The former was characterized by a diffuse monomorphic population of large atypical lymphoid cells, while neoplastic follicles were identified in the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neither polymorphic inflammatory infiltrates nor maturation phenomenon was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The immunostaining for kappa and lambda light chains was inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Molecular study showed clonal rearrangement of IgH gene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, as well as 2 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-like lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The distinction between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-like lesion and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of uterine cervix depends primarily on the clinical and histopathologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Assay for rearrangement of IgH gene may be helpful in differential diagnosis, though monoclonality can be detected in some benign lesions as well </plain></SENT>
