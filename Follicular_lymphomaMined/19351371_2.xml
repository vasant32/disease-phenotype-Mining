<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transformation from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) to high-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLL</z:e>) has been reported in patients with additional translocations involving the c-MYC gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The previously reported cases were related to t(8;14) and t(8;22) but not to t(2;8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein is reported an FL that terminated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLL</z:e> following additional t(2;8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In accordance with previous reports, increased expression of c-MYC was observed in the present case but, interestingly, BCL-2 expression was inversely decreased after the transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the cell-surface immunoglobulin light-chain of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells was initially kappa type and was then gradually replaced with the lambda type after transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Downregulation of BCL-2 and light-chain switch have rarely been reported in previous cases of FL transformation involving c-MYC, suggesting that additional t(2;8) translocation may play a role in these events </plain></SENT>
