<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most frequent disease sites were the palate (21 cases), gingiva (17 cases) and parotid gland (13 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was classified according to the criteria of the Working Formulation for Clinical Usage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only 5.7% of cases were follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> while diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had a high incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histologic subtypes included small lymphocytic (1%), small cleaved cell (7%), mixed small and large cell (20%), large cell (43%), large cell, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> (17%), lymphoblastic (9%) and small non-cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (3%) </plain></SENT>
