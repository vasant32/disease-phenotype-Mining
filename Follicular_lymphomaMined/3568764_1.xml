<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This probe was used to map the LTR of ERV1 by in situ hybridization to chromosomes from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human blood lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The LTR was found to be localized to the distal portion of the long arm of human chromosome 18, within bands q22----q23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This chromosome locus is near the constitutive fragile site at band q21.3 on chromosome 18 associated with the 14;18 translocations seen in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
