<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied the specificity of complement receptors induced by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28177">theophylline</z:chebi> in 2 cell lines derived from undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, one of Burkitt's type, and compared it to that of complement receptors in other cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both C3b and C3d receptors were induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The induced C3b receptor differed from the C3b receptor of mature <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes and the cells of a nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 2 respects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Firstly, it bound C3b much less avidly (by a factor of several hundred-fold) and secondly, we were unable to demonstrate C4b binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EBV receptors were induced at the same time as complement receptors, and permitted the conversion of a greater fraction of cells to EBNA positivity after experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The induction of receptors was not associated with a change in the fluidity of the plasma membranes and our data do not favor a different orientation of induced receptors within the membrane as compared to receptors of other cell types--a potential explanation for the different specificities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings are consistent with the possibility that the complement receptors of lymphocyte precursors differ from these of mature lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
