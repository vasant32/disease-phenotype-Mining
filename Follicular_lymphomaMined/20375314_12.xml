<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microvessel density has been shown to be a useful prognostic factor based on numerical assessment of vessel numbers within histologic sections in some studies, but assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> neovascularization through angiogenic sprouting may be more relevant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined the smallest vessels, single-staining structures measuring less than 30 microm(2) in area, seen within histologic sections, and confirmed that they were neovascular angiogenic sprouts using extended focal imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissue microarrays composing diagnostic biopsies from patients at the extremes of survival of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were analyzed with respect to numbers of these sprouts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This analysis revealed higher angiogenic activity in the poor prognostic group and demonstrated an association between increased sprouting and elevated numbers of infiltrating CD163(+) macrophages within the immediate microenvironment surrounding the neovascular sprout </plain></SENT>
