<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study for bcl-10, as well as dual staining with CD20, was performed by EnVision method in paraffin sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> of tonsil, bcl-10 was moderately or strongly expressed in the cytoplasm of germinal center B cells, while the mantle cells were negative and the marginal zone cells and paracortical T cells showed weak staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 5 cases of reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> of orbit, 2 were bcl-10-negative and the remaining 3 expressed bcl-10 in the cytoplasm of germinal center B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As for non-MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 3 gastric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> showed nuclear expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining cases showed variable cytoplasmic staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In some cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, bcl-10 was expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells but not in reactive lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, 92.1% (129/140) of MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were bcl-10 positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among those cases, 54.3% (76/140) showed cytoplasmic positivity and 37.9% (53/140) showed nuclear positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The nuclear positivity rate of bcl-10 in different anatomic sites was different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The staining was most intense in MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of ocular adnexa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Dual staining with CD20 showed that the bcl-10-positive cells were also CD20-positive, though the number of bcl-10-positive cells were less than that of CD20-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bcl-10 expression in <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> is a universal phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic expression of bcl-10 is seen in many different kinds of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and reactive lymphoid conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In some cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, bcl-10 is expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells but not in reactive lymphoid cells, suggesting a possible role of abnormal bcl-10 expression in tumorgenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Nuclear expression of bcl-10 is seen mainly in MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, especially when occurring in ocular adnexa and lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to loss of bcl-10 expression in residual germinal center cells </plain></SENT>
