<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although circulating FL cells may be detected by high-resolution analysis, bloodstream involvement by FL cells is unusual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We observed in 10 patients a leukemic phase of FL at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six of them had concomitant lymph node involvement and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them required treatment at diagnosis due to a high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden, whereas four patients had pure FL-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, which was associated with a more indolent clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The detection of a leukemic phase should therefore be studied as a potential prognosis marker in further studies </plain></SENT>
