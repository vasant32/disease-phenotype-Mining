<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight had the poorly differentiated lymphocytic type; the remaining four had the "histiocytic" type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 12 patients were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine were asymptomatic, and eight had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> in the head and neck region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison of ages revealed the extent of disease tended to be localized (Stages I and II) in the pediatric (less than 16 years old) patients (83%) and generalized in the adolescent-young adult (16-19 years old) patients (83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of ten patients treated with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, eight achieved complete remissions that lasted 3-58 months (median, 17.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five are still in remission; three have relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven are alive 12-120 months from diagnosis (median, 48 months); six have no clinical evidence of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining five patients died two to 164 months after diagnosis (median, 13 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three of the four patients who died with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had diffuse "histiocytic" <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> demonstrated at autopsy examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Poor prognostic factors included 1) failure to achieve a complete remission following initial therapy; 2) extranodal disease (with the exception of the poorly differentiated lymphocytic type involving the spleen and liver); 3) development of diffuse "histiocytic" <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> occurring in the second decade of life has a biologic behavior similar to follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in adults </plain></SENT>
