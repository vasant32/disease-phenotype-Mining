<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This LOH has not been previously reported in association with FL transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other sites of frequent LOH include chromosome arms 6q and 9p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LOH was observed in both transformed FL and relapse FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that altered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes exist on 6q, 9p, and 12p that have an important role in the progression of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic changes accumulated in relapsed FL in the absence of histological changes compared to initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
