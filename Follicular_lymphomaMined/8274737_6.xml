<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Expression of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene on chromosome 18 is deregulated by the 14; 18 chromosomal translocation, an abnormality that is consistently associated with follicular non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because bcl-2 is believed to function by prolonging cell survival rather than by increasing proliferation, the presence of t(14; 18) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) would have profound implications for the pathogenesis of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 32 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> for t(14; 18) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results were correlated with expression of bcl-2 oncogenic protein by Hodgkin cells and with the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), as determined by immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PCR provided evidence of t(14; 18) in only 2 HD cases (6%), both of which were associated with a prior history of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and both of which were among the 7 cases (22%) with strong bcl-2 expression in Hodgkin cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In at least 1 of the cases, the translocation involved identical chromosomal breakpoints in both types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 7 additional cases of combined follicular NHL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> showed strong bcl-2 staining in Hodgkin cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although EBV was detected in 6 of 30 cases, it was not associated with t(14; 18) and usually not with strong bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a small proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> cases might evolve from follicular NHL, possibly through molecular events superimposed on the t(14; 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High-level bcl-2 expression in Hodgkin cells is a potentially useful but not definitive marker for these cases </plain></SENT>
