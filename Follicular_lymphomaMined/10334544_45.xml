<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To correlate cytogenetic abnormalities with clinical presentation and outcome in Burkitt-like, small noncleaved non-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (SNC-NB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with SNC-NB <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and a clonal karyotype were evaluated between January 1989 and January 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were from British Columbia, Canada, underwent uniform clinical staging, and were treated on investigational protocols by a small group of clinicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three groups of patients were identified by clonal karyotype on cytogenetic analysis: (1) those with a c-myc translocation (n = 11); (2) those with dual translocation of c-myc and bcl-2 (n = 13); and (3) those with other cytogenetic abnormalities (n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The c-myc group was younger, presented with earlier stage de nova disease, and had a better clinical prognostic factor profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dual-translocation and other groups were older and presented in advanced stage with poorer prognostic features, and a larger proportion of the dual-translocation group patients had transformed from previously diagnosed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival (OS) time for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median OS time for the dual-translocation group was only 2.5 months, as compared with 7 months and 8 months for the c-myc and other group, respectively (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no survivors beyond 7 months among the dual-translocation group, as opposed to 32% and 25% 2-year OS rates in the c-myc and other group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SNC-NB <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is a clinically and cytogenetically heterogenous disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dual translocation of c-myc and bcl-2 is characterized by a rapid clinical course and extremely poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This latter entity may represent the most clinically aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> thus far characterized and warrants intensive investigational treatment where feasible </plain></SENT>
