<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NNHL) are extremely rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we will report the progress achieved in the management of this disease in our institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 26 patients having primary NNHL who were managed between January 1997 and December 2008, to evaluate and compare their clinical characteristics and treatment outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical variables, including age, sex, stage, and treatment modality, were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disease free survival and overall survival were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival curves were constructed using the KaplanMeier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The log-rank test was used to compare them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median age of our patients was 52.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001742'>Nasal obstruction</z:hpo>, nasal discharge and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> were the frequent symptoms in NNHL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histology of NNHL were mainly large B-cell and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients (15.4%) were at stage I, 15 (57.6%) at stage II, and 7 (27%) were at stage III/IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patients were treated with chemotherapy alone (27%) or chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (73%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At early stage (stage I/II), the patients were managed with chemo-radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>When the whole treatment was completed, 18 patients (69.2%) achieved complete response and remained disease free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>After 25.9 months median follow-up, overall survival at 1 year was 87% and disease free survival at 1 year was 71% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The difference in term of overall and disease free survival between stage I, II, III and IV was significant (Log rank test: p = 0.02 for overall survival and p = 0.01 for disease free survival) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: From our study, we conclude that histological characteristics, principle of treatment and outcome of primary NNHL patients are particular and more studies have to be directed </plain></SENT>
