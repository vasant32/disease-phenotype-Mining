<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We set out to evaluate the role of consolidation with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">yttrium</z:chebi>-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan in intermediate and high-risk FL patients after four cycles of CHOP-R and two CHOP cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>30 patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate after consolidation therapy was 93% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 18 patients who presented partial remission after the induction treatment, 11 had complete remission after the consolidation treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The complete clinical response rate was 76.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most important G 3 / 4 toxicity was hematological, with 46% <z:mp ids='MP_0003179'>thrombopenia</z:mp> and 56% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With median follow-up of 26 months the means for progression-free survival or overall survival were not reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data support consolidation treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">yttrium</z:chebi>-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan as an effective treatment, and it provides a long progression-free survival and overall survival in first line after response to induction treatment in intermediate and high-risk FL patients </plain></SENT>
