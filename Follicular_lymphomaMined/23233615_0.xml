<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the introduction of rituximab, it appears that the natural history of this incurable disease has changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, most of the contemporary treatment data have been generated in patients with high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden, and it is unclear whether the improvements in outcome also apply to the LTB population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are no published trials evaluating rituximab-chemotherapy combinations and just a few studies evaluating single-agent rituximab in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a result, there are many unknowns in the management of LTB-FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="?"><plain>Would the application of rituximab-chemotherapy combination cure a fraction of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="?"><plain>Would the application of rituximab-chemotherapy combination improve the overall survival of the population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="?"><plain>Would treatment with single-agent rituximab improve the psychologic quality of life by avoiding a watch and wait interval or by delaying the time to first chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This review, a mixture of data and opinion, will discuss goals of therapy for an LTB-FL patient, summarize existing data, and propose a management algorithm </plain></SENT>
