<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a patient who showed the sequential occurrence of four different lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> together with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of the lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 62-year-old man with <z:mp ids='MP_0000702'>adenopathy</z:mp> was admitted to the hospital, and lymph node biopsy was positive for low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He achieved a partial remission with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two years later, a PET-CT scan showed a left hilar mass in the lung; biopsy showed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously, he was diagnosed with diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in a neck lymph node; after chemo- and radiotherapy, he achieved a complete response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A restaging PET-CT scan 2 years later revealed a retroperitoneal nodule, and biopsy again showed a low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, while a biopsy of a cutaneous scalp lesion showed a CD30-positive peripheral T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After some months, a liver biopsy and a right cervical lymph node biopsy showed a CD30-positive peripheral T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> consistent with anaplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> kinase-negative anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry and cytogenetic and molecular genetic analysis performed at diagnosis and during the patient's follow-up confirmed the presence of two clonally distinct B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, while the two T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were confirmed to be clonally related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We discuss the relationship between multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> occurring in the same patient and the various possible risk factors involved in their development </plain></SENT>
