<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective study to describe the outcomes of patients with relapsed, refractory or transformed FL who received <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">yttrium</z:chebi>-90 ((90)Y)-ibritumomab tiuxetan followed by fludarabine and low-dose BU RIC allogeneic HSCT at the Dana-Farber <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute between 2006 and 2009, inclusively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients were identified with a median age of 55 (40-66) years and a median number of lines of therapy of 5 (2-10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients (17%) had transformed to a more aggressive histology and five (42%) had chemorefractory FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cumulative incidences of grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD at 100 days were 17% (±11%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD at 12 months were 63% (±19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two-year non-relapse mortality was 18% (±12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two-year OS and PFS were 83% (±11%) and 74% (±13%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This treatment is associated with favorable outcomes including acceptable rates of GVHD and relapse in advanced FL patients, and warrants prospective studies </plain></SENT>
