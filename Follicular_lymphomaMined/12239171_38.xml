<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study examines this possibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that the expression of p57(KIP2) gene is absent in various hematological cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exposing cell lines to the DNA demethylating agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> restored p57(KIP2) gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">Bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing analysis of its promoter region showed that p57(KIP2) DNA was completely methylated in cell lines that did not express the p57(KIP2) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, DNA methylation of its promoter might lead to inactivation of the p57(KIP2) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation of this region is thought to be an aberrant alteration, since DNA was not methylated in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood mononuclear cells or in reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002840'>lymphadenitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis found frequent DNA methylation of the p57(KIP2) gene in primary diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (54.9%) and in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (44.0%), but methylation was infrequent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and adult T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (3.0% and 2.0%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings directly indicate that the profile of the p57(KIP2) gene corresponds to that of a TSG </plain></SENT>
