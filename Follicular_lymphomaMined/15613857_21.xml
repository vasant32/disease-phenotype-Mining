<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical, morphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular cytogenetic features of 17 patients with primary cutaneous FL were studied and compared with 16 patients with secondary cutaneous FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The head and neck region was the most frequent site at initial skin presentation in both the primary and secondary cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the primary cases, 29% of the 31 biopsies were grade 1, 48% grade 2, 13% grade 3, and 10% grade 3 with diffuse large B-cell (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the secondary cases, 38% of the 29 skin biopsies were grade 1, 45% grade 2, 3% grade 3, and 7% grade 3 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> areas with two not evaluable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A floral-like pattern was observed in 32% of primary FL but only 5% of secondary cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histologic progression was found in 21% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD10 expression was demonstrated in 90% (27 of 30) of primary cases and 96% (22 of 23) of secondary cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bcl-6 was expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 expression was detected in 57% (17 of 30) of the primary cases (100% of grade 1, 43% of grade 2, 40% of grade 3), whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> secondary cases were bcl-2 positive (P=0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18) translocation was identified by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in biopsies from 31% (4 of 13) of the patients with primary FL compared with 77% (10 of 13) of those with secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (P &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven of the 17 (41%) patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> had cutaneous relapse, including 1 who also developed nodal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 positivity was seen in 4 of these 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 16 (50%) patients with secondary FL had cutaneous relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Primary and secondary cutaneous FL share many clinical and phenotypic features, but primary cases may have some distinctive morphologic features, more frequently lack bcl-2 protein, and often lack the t(14;18) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that primary cutaneous FL are distinctive and often but not always have a pathogenesis different from most of nodal and secondary cutaneous FL </plain></SENT>
