<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The use of flow cytometry to diagnose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> has become routine due to its ability to often differentiate between morphologically similar diseases based on antigens expressed on the surface of malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to expand on the utility of flow cytometry in the study of B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> we have used the most reliable quantitative methodology, QIFI (quantitative indirect immunofluorescence assay), to study the expression of CD5, CD10, CD11c, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD23, and CD79b in 384 cases of several common B-lineage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, including: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>, CLL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>, hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The impetus behind this extensive, single institution study of surface antigens was two-fold: evaluating similarities and differences of antigen expression between B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and finding additional clinical utility for the quantitative flow cytometric data generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results show that each distinct malignant histology has its own quantitative pattern of surface antigen expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In most cases, these quantitative patterns do not increase the ability of flow cytometry to distinguish between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, a high expression of specific antigens on a given B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> may potentially identify optimal therapeutic targets for current and/or future monoclonal antibody-based therapies </plain></SENT>
