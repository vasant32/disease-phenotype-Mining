<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To further clarify the histopathological findings of the floral variant of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FVFL), we studied 13 Japanese cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two histological subtypes of neoplastic follicles of FVFL have been described: (i) A macrogerminal center pattern where the mantle zone lymphocytes were invaginated into the neoplastic germinal center, often reminiscent of a floral design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(ii) A microgerminal center pattern where the massive invasion of mantle zone lymphocytes resulted in almost complete breakage of the neoplastic follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the former pattern, the neoplastic germinal center usually contained large clusters of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, whereas in the latter, small clusters of up to 20 tumor cells or isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were observed in the neoplastic germinal centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, occasional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells showed a lymphocytic and/or histiocytic Reed-Sternberg cell (L&amp;H cells)-like <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both types of neoplastic follicles were observed to a varying degree in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The macrogerminal center pattern was predominant in nine cases (70%), whilst the microgerminal center pattern was predominant in only four cases (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three lesions (23%) had a marginal zone component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry showed that atypical follicular center cells, including L&amp;H cells, were CD3-, CD5-, CD10+, CD20+, CD43-, bcl-2+, cyclinD1- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall histological findings of the macrogerminal center are similar to those of florid progressive transformation of germinal center (PTGC), whilst the microgerminal center pattern is similar to that of nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Initially, the differential diagnosis between FVFL and florid PTGC was emphasized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the present study indicates that nodal marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> possessing floral follicles and nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> should be added to the differential diagnosis of FVFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The germinal center B-cell nature of FVFL is most clearly recognizable by immunohistochemistry, though histological appearance alone may cause some diagnostic problems </plain></SENT>
