<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two of the probes detected DNA rearrangements in approximately 60 percent of the cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, most of the breakpoints in band q21 of chromosome 18 were clustered within a short stretch of DNA, approximately 2.1 kilobases in length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromosome 18-specific DNA probes for the areas flanking the breakpoints also detected <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> transcripts 6 kilobases in length in various cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The gene coding for these transcript (the bcl-2 gene) seems to be interrupted in most cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> carrying the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation </plain></SENT>
