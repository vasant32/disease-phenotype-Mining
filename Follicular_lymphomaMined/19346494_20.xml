<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated whether this positive correlation extends to overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 91 untreated patients who received CVP chemotherapy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>) followed by idiotype vaccination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Idiotype proteins were produced either by the hybridoma method or by expression of recombinant idiotype-encoding sequences in mammalian or plant-based expression systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that achieving a complete response/complete response unconfirmed (CR/CRu) to CVP and making an anti-idiotype antibody are 2 independent factors that each correlated with longer OS at 10 years (89% vs 68% with or without a CR/CRu, P = .024; 90% vs 69% with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific antibody production; P = .027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the subset of patients who received hybridoma-generated vaccines, we found that anti-idiotype production was even more highly associated with superior OS (P &lt; .002); this was the case even in patients with a partial response (PR) to CVP (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
