<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initially considered a benign disorder, and named <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024301" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Brill - Symmers disease</z:e> after the authors of the original papers, it was rapidly recognized as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> with a variable but often indolent course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of its clinical features were described by the early 1940s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite discussion about its cell of origin, and in contrast to many other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> could always be accurately recognized and diagnosed using light microscopy morphological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>B-cell origin was demonstrated in the 1970s and the important role of t(14;18) and bcl-2 gene rearrangement in the pathogenesis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was established shortly thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The etiology of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the reason for marked geographic variation in its incidence, the role of alternative molecular pathways in its pathogenesis, and the cause for its variable clinical behavior <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several observations suggest an important role for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> immune response in regulating the clinical behavior of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From the earliest descriptions, radiation therapy was shown to be very effective in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but not curative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Combination chemotherapy was tested in the 1970s, but despite high rates of response, there was only minimal impact on survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interferon combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> based chemotherapy was the first treatment to improve survival, but was not widely adopted in the USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Randomized studies have shown an impact of autologous transplantation on progression free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic transplantation is a curative therapy, but is too toxic for widespread application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Targeted therapies, particularly rituximab have revolutionized the treatment of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A convergence of technological and biological advances will likely lead to further dramatic progress in the next decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>For the first time consistent improvements in survival of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are reported </plain></SENT>
