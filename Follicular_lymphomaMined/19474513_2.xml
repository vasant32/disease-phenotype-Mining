<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous reports emphasized that localized <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> (LLH) of the large intestine is usually histologically characterized by large lymphoid follicles with striking enlarged germinal centers, and a narrow surrounding mantle zone and marginal zone (MZ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify the histological varieties of LLH of the large intestine, 16 such cases have been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrated histological diversity of the LLH of the large intestine including (i) reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> (RFH) (n=8), (ii) RFH with progressive transformation of the germinal center (PTGC) (n=3), (iii) RFH with MZ <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> (n=3) and (iv) RFH with PTGC and MZ <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> (n=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall histomorphological findings of the present series appear quite different from previous descriptions of LLH of the large intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study showed histological variety of the LLH of the large intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, LLH of the large intestine should be differentiated from extranodal marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> as well as follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistological studies demonstrated the reactive nature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 16 lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, three cases showing RFH demonstrated immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement by polymerase chain reaction study in 12 cases examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It remains unclear whether these three cases showing RFH could be a sign of the prelymphomatous stage (incipient follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) or representing merely an exaggeration of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cell clonal response in the germinal centers </plain></SENT>
