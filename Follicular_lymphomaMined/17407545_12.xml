<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male and female patients with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 710) between 18 and 80 years of age were prospectively recruited in six study regions in Germany (Ludwigshafen/Upper Palatinate, Heidelberg/Rhine-Neckar-County, Würzburg/Lower Frankonia, Hamburg, Bielefeld/Gütersloh, and Munich) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each newly recruited <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> case, a gender, region and age-matched (+/- 1 year of birth) population control was drawn from the population registers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a structured personal interview, we elicited a complete occupational history, including every occupational period that lasted at least one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the basis of job task-specific supplementary questionnaires, a trained occupational physician assessed the exposure to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="23115">chlorinated hydrocarbons</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16602">trichloroethylene</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17300">tetrachloroethylene</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15767">dichloromethane</z:chebi>, carbon tetrachloride) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33658">aromatic hydrocarbons</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17578">toluene</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27338">xylene</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27452">styrene</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using conditional logistic regression analysis, adjusted for smoking (in pack years) and alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To increase the statistical power, patients with specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subentities were additionally compared with the entire control group using unconditional logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed a statistically significant association between high exposure to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="23115">chlorinated hydrocarbons</z:chebi> and malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Odds ratio = 2.1; 95% confidence interval 1.1-4.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subentities, a pronounced risk elevation was found for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When specific substances were considered, the association between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16602">trichloroethylene</z:chebi> and malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was of borderline statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="33658">Aromatic hydrocarbons</z:chebi> were not significantly associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In accordance with the literature, this data point to a potential etiologic role of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="23115">chlorinated hydrocarbons</z:chebi> (particularly <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16602">trichloroethylene</z:chebi>) and malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="23115">Chlorinated hydrocarbons</z:chebi> might affect specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subentities differentially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our study does not support a strong association between <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33658">aromatic hydrocarbons</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17578">toluene</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27338">xylene</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27452">styrene</z:chebi>) and the diagnosis of a malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
