<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we encountered two cases of EBV-GC of ordinary histopathological type coexistent with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient was a 71-year-old Japanese man who had two lesions, one in the cardia and the other in the antrum of the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The former was EBV-GC without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and antral one was EBV-GC with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He had EBV-GC with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the fundus of the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both cases, gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were positive for EBV-encoded small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> by in situ hybridization, whereas the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, infiltrating nonneoplastic lymphocytes, and nonneoplastic epithelial cells were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present cases suggest that focal immunosuppression by adjacent gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> might be related to the alteration of the microenvironment and development of EBV-GC </plain></SENT>
