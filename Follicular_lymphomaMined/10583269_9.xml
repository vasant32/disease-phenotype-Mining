<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on today's knowledge of the intrinsic properties related to this mechanism and the VH base composition, reconsideration of previous reports should be made on a broader range of samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the mutation pattern of the VH genes expressed by 55 cases of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FL VH genes showed evidence of antigenic selection in 30% of cases with 88% carrying a functional sIg and 78.2% showing intraclonal variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VH family and gene segment utilization was found to be roughly similar to that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FL VH genes revealed extensive variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>17% of the VH exons harboured a total of five deletions, three duplications and two insertions as compared to the most homologous germline counterpart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The VH genes of one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> displayed three populations with varying CDR3 length at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At relapse, emergence of a differently mutated gene, additional mutations reminiscent of ongoing mutations or no variation was prominent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From this study the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of FLs is well established and ongoing mutations are seen in the scope of the activated status of the hypermutation mechanism rather than antigen-stimulated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
