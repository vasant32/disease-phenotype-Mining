<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the t(14; 18) translocation bearing cell line SU-DHL-6, this results not only in an inappropriately high rate of bcl-2 transcription for a mature B cell, but also in two potentially critical point mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the relative importance of these mutations, we searched for their presence in DNA from the involved lymph nodes of 12 patients with t(14; 18) follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>bcl-2 genomic sequences were specifically amplified by the polymerase chain reaction technique and then directly sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the 12 samples analysed revealed the codon 7 or codon 129 mutation detected in SU-DHL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that abnormal expression of bcl-2 rather than structural alterations at codon 7 or 129 play an important role in the disordered growth and differentiation of follicular B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
