<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the basis of cytology and membrane phenotype the following disorders were defined: (i) B cell type: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (CLL); CLL of mixed cell type, which includes cases with more than 10% and less than 55% prolymphocytes (CLL/PL), and a less well defined form with pleomorphic lymphocytes but less than 10% prolymphocytes; prolymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53412">PLL</z:chebi>); hairy cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (HCL); HCL variant; splenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with circulating villous lymphocytes; leukaemic phase of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, intermediate, or mantle zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and others); lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with peripheral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1533163" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood disease</z:e> (mostly Waldenström's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024419" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">macroglobulinaemia</z:e>); and plasma cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(ii) T cell type: T/CLL, which was differentiated from reactive T/<z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo>; T/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53412">PLL</z:chebi>; adult T cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036920" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Sézary's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
