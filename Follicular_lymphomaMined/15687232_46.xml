<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a randomized study using a purged autologous stem-cell support, we compared these 2 approaches in patients with advanced follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Newly diagnosed advanced follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients (172 patients) were randomly assigned either to an immunochemotherapy regimen (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, teniposide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, and interferon) or to a high-dose therapy followed by purged autologous stem-cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with the patients who received chemotherapy and interferon, patients treated with high-dose therapy had a higher response rate (69% vs 81%, P = .045) and a longer median event-free survival (not reached vs 45 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This did not translate into a better survival rate due to an excess of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">secondary malignancies</z:e> after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Prognostic Index identified a subgroup of patients with a significantly higher event-free survival rate after high-dose therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Autologous stem-cell transplantation cannot be considered as the standard first-line treatment of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> for patients younger than 60 years old with a high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden </plain></SENT>
