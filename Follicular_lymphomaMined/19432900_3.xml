<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We conducted a phase I/II study to investigate the toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy profiles of cladribine with 2-h intravenous infusion for five consecutive days every four weeks in Japanese patients with relapsed indolent B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was a dose-escalation study to confirm the safety of the doses which have been recommended for Caucasian patients (phase I), and to further evaluate the efficacy and safety (phase II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the phase I portion for nine patients, no dose-limiting toxicities were observed at levels 1 (0.09 mg/kg/day, n = 3) and 2 (0.12 mg/kg/day, n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No appreciable accumulation of plasma cladribine concentration was suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We enrolled a total of 20 patients, and an additional 14 patients in the phase II portion at level 2 (0.12 mg/kg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients, including 13 with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, were eligible for efficacy evaluation, and 15 (83%) were pretreated with rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 50% (9/18; 80% confidence interval, 35-65%), with 11% (2/18) complete response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 296 days, the estimated median time to progression for 18 eligible patients was 382 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequent adverse events were hematologic toxicities, including grade 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Non-hematologic toxicities were mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, cladribine with 2-h intravenous infusion for five consecutive days every four weeks is effective with acceptable toxicities for Japanese patients with relapsed indolent B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, including those pretreated with rituximab </plain></SENT>
