<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>DP-1 is a G1 cell cycle-related protein that forms heterodimers with E2F, a family of transcriptional factors regulating the expression of genes important for G1 to S progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the exact role of DP-1 is not well understood, it has been shown to stabilize DNA binding of E2F proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By immunohistochemistry, the authors examined the expression of DP-1 in lymphoid tissues, including 8 cases of reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> and 69 cases of B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of the cell cycle-related proteins E2F-1 and Ki-67 was also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scoring was based on the proportion of labeled nuclei (1-10%, 11-25%, 26-50%, and &gt; 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo>, staining for DP-1, E2F-1, and Ki-67 was largely confined to the germinal centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 25 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, regardless of grade, had a high proportion (&gt; 50%) of DP-1-positive cells but a lower proportion of cells marking for E2F-1 and Ki-67 (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (n = 24) had high DP-1 and Ki-67 scores but low E2F-1 scores (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Small lymphocytic (n = 10), marginal zone (n = 3), and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (n = 5) contained relatively low proportions of cells labeled for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Precursor B-cell lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 2) displayed high proportions of cells positive for DP-1, Ki-67, and E2F-1 (&gt; 50% in both cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Except in follicular center cell lesions, DP-1 expression generally correlated with that of Ki-67 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the expression of DP-1 was discordant with that of E2F-1 in benign and malignant follicular center cells, suggesting that DP-1 may have functions other than facilitating E2F-1-dependent gene regulation and cell cycle progression in these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
