<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We determined the potential value of protein profiling of tissue samples by assessing how precise this approach enables discrimination of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from reactive lymph nodes, and how well the profiles can be used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Protein lysates from lymph nodes (n=239) from patients with the diagnosis of reactive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> (n=44), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=63), diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=43), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=47), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=42) were analysed by SELDI-TOF MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data analysis was performed by (i) classification and regression tree-based analysis and (ii) binary and polytomous logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After internal validation by the leave-one-out principle, both the classification and regression tree and logistic regression classification correctly identified the majority of the malignant (87 and 96%, respectively) and benign cases (73 and 75%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Classification was less successful since approximately one-third of the cases of each group were misclassified according to the histological classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, an additional mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> case that was misclassified as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> initially was identified based on the protein profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: SELDI-TOF MS protein profiling allows for reliable identification of the majority of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases; however, further validation and testing robustness in a diagnostic setting is needed </plain></SENT>
