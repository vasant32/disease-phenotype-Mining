<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the chromosomes of 49 non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients from an area of Japan that is nonendemic for adult T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clonal chromosome abnormalities were found in the majority (88%) of the specimens examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most characteristic structural abnormalities were: t(14;18)(q32;q21), t(3;22)(q27;q11), t(11;14)(q13;32), idic(18)(p11.2), and the combination del(1)(p13) and del(1)(q11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18) were found in four of five follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and in one diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The breaks at 3q27 included seven translocations and an inv(3)(q12q27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A t(3;22) was found in three patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B-cell type, two of whom had kappa phenotype and one of whom was negative for the surface Ig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of 49 cases had deletion of 6q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The common deleted region was found only in the segment distal to 6q21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate the high percentage of t(14;18) in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, which is unusual in Japan, and the high incidence of 3q27 translocations </plain></SENT>
