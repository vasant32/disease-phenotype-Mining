<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although sIL-2R level has a prognostic value in patients with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, its clinical role in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed data on 70 patients diagnosed with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ann Arbor stage was I, II, III, and IV in 6, 9, 17, and 38 patients, respectively, and grade classification according to the World Health Organization criteria was 1, 2, 3A, 3B, and not available in 28, 15, 11, 4, and 12 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>sIL-2R at diagnosis was significantly correlated with Ann Arbor stages (P &lt; .001), number of nodal lesions (≥ 5 or not) (P = .0050), and Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognosis Index risk classification (P = .0015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, sIL-2R regressed significantly in patients who achieved complete remission, uncertain complete remission, or partial remission (P &lt; .001), and increased when regrowth of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was shown (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, a high level of sIL-2R at diagnosis was correlated with shorter progression-free survival (P = .018) and time to next treatment (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Serum-soluble interleukin-2 receptor is correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden at diagnosis and during the clinical course of therapies in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and our data support its usefulness to function as a surrogate marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
