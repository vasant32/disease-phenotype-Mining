<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Judging by bcl-2 rearrangement (bcl-2R), one third of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> are believed to be of FL derivation in the Western population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, bcl-2R is not specific and is not detectable in every case of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In East Asia, FL is uncommon but <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> is not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of FL origin in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> is not known in this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The coexpression of Bcl-6 and CD10 proteins, a reliable marker to identify germinal center (GC) B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> including FL, was analyzed in primary nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> (n = 104) diagnosed at major hospitals in Seoul during a recent 2-year period, along with well-defined cases (n = 17) of nodal FL as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 protein expression (n = 77) was also studied along with bcl-2R (n = 64), by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Formalin-fixed archival specimens were used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Bcl-6/CD10 coexpression was observed in 35 DLBCLs (34%) and 14 FLs (82%), and most of them showed a pattern of Bcl-6 expression similar to that of the GC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 expression or bcl-2R did not correlate with Bcl-6/CD10 coexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histologically, compartmentalizing <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> was associated with a high rate of the coexpression (8 of 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, to detect GC B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in routine biopsy specimens, a pattern of Bcl-6 staining similar to the GC must be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Bcl-6+/CD10+ GC B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> thus defined comprised one third of primary nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate is similar to that in the West </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The reasons for the discrepancy between the incidence of GC B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the paucity of the follicular pattern in East Asian subjects warrant further studies </plain></SENT>
