<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 473 patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we found 16 (3.4%) with NH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most patients (13/16) presented with pathologic stage (PS) III or IV disease, including 7 with liver involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient (PS III) was initially treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> alone, and 4 patients received only radiotherapy, and none were long-term survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients received combination chemotherapy, and 8 achieved complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only one of these patients relapsed and died at 19 mo; the other 7 continue in complete remission without maintenance therapy with a minimum followup of 4.5 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The survival of the entire group of patients with NH is intermediate between that of the other nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and diffuse histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine of 16 patients had either a repeat lymph node biopsy during the course of their disease or lymph node examination at autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lymph node histology in the majority converted to a diffuse, less differentiated subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NH has a natural history similar to that of diffuse histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and should be approached with the same therapeutic strategy </plain></SENT>
