<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The idiotype (Id) of the immunoglobulin on a given B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> is a clonal marker that can serve as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed a novel vaccine formulation by incorporating Id protein with liposomal lymphokine that was more potent than a prototype, carrier-conjugated Id protein vaccine in preclinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Ten patients with advanced-stage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were treated with five doses of this second generation vaccine after chemotherapy-induced clinical remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were evaluated for cellular and humoral immune responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Autologous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and Id-specific type I cytokine responses were induced by vaccination in 10 and 9 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antitumor immune responses were mediated by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, were human lymphocyte antigen class I and II associated, and persisted 18 months beyond the completion of vaccination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specific anti-Id antibody responses were detected in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 50 months, 6 of the 10 patients remain in continuous first complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This first clinical report of a liposomal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> vaccine demonstrates that liposomal delivery is safe, induces sustained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, and may serve as a model for vaccine development against other human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and infectious pathogens </plain></SENT>
