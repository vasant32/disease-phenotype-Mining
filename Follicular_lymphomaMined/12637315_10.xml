<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our laboratory has recently discovered a novel candidate oncogene, MCT-1, amplified in human T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and mapped to chromosome Xq22-24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This region is amplified in a subset of primary B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), suggesting that increased copy number of a gene(s) located in this region confers a growth advantage to some primary human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined a diverse panel of lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> for the expression of MCT-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that there are significantly increased levels of MCT-1 protein in a panel of T-cell lymphoid cell lines and in non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we identified a subset of primary diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that exhibited elevated levels of MCT-1 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in our study demonstrated elevated protein levels of MCT-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no detectable MCT-1 protein in leukemic cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> or in any healthy lymphoid tissue examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lymphoid cell lines overexpressing MCT-1 exhibited <z:mp ids='MP_0002865'>increased growth rates</z:mp> and displayed increased protection against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by serum starvation when compared with matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that MCT-1-overexpressing cells show constitutively higher levels of phosphorylated PKB/Akt protein, especially under serum starvation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Activation of survival pathways may be an additional function of the MCT-1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that high levels of MCT-1 protein may be associated with a high-risk subset of lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and may further support the potential role of MCT-1 in promoting human <z:mp ids='MP_0002022'>lymphoid tumor</z:mp> development </plain></SENT>
