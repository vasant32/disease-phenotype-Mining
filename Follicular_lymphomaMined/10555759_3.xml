<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2, the gene over-expressed in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL), is able to block chemotherapy-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consequently, we wondered whether bcl-2/IgH expression variations during treatment of FL could predict the outcome of patients with t(14;18)-bearing FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, we used a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay to analyse 180 serial peripheral blood samples (PBS) during 34 treatment phases in 25 patients with t(14;18)-bearing FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients but two, bcl-2/IgH gene expression was demonstrated in pre-treatment samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During 16 out of the 34 treatment phases (47%), bcl-2/IgH expression became negative: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one were responders to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This conversion was transient in six cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 18 treatment phases, bcl2/IgH expression remained detectable: eight were clinically considered as treatment failures, while eight others achieved PR and two achieved CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed a significant correlation between treatment response and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> PCR results (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three-year overall survival of patients with stable bcl2/IgH-negative conversion was 100% compared to 54% for the remaining patients (P = 0.069); 3-year freedom from progression was respectively 87.5% and 13% (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate a correlation between bcl-2/IgH expression variations and both clinical response and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whether this might predict disease outcome early remains to be confirmed </plain></SENT>
