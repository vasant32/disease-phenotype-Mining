<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Differential diagnoses included brain infiltration by CLL as opposed to progressive multifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> (PML) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed a hyperintense T2-weighted signal in the left frontal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebro-spinal fluid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive for virus JC (JCV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings were compatible with the diagnosis of PML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fludarabine has been used to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo>, CLL and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Its toxicity includes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e>, immunosuppression and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> life-threatening neurotoxicity, although standard doses of it are considered safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>Late-onset</z:hpo> fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral dysfunction</z:e> caused by JCV after standard-dose fludarabine has been described previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The widespread and increasing use of fludarabine makes it interesting to define the potential of standard doses of fludarabine for causing severe neurological side-effects such as PML </plain></SENT>
