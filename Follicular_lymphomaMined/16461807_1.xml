<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the expression of human <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptors (hGRs), such as hGR (4H2), hGR-alpha, and hGR-beta, in non-neoplastic lymphoid follicles and B cell type malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The expression of hGRs in non-neoplastic lymphoid follicles and malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, was examined immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HGR (4H2) expression was confirmed by double immunostaining of tissues and in isolated cells from tonsillar germinal centres, and by immunoelectronmicroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In secondary lymphoid follicles of any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1709246" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">non-neoplastic diseases</z:e>--such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011110'>tonsillitis</z:hpo>, reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002840'>lymphadenitis</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033838" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Kimura's disease</z:e>--the germinal centre cells often expressed hGR (4H2) and hGR-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Double immunocytochemical staining of isolated germinal centre cells showed that the majority of hGR (4H2) positive cells were CD20 positive B cells, and that follicular dendritic cells also expressed hGR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoelectronmicroscopy revealed the presence of nuclear hGR (4H2) in the binucleated follicular dendritic cells and germinal centre cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of hGR (4H2) expression in diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was higher, that in mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was lower, and that in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was intermediate among the types of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hGR (4H2) expression was less frequent in cases of grade I follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are differences in hGR expression between the germinal centre and the mantle zone in non-neoplastic lymphoid follicles, and differences of hGR (4H2) expression among the types of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and grades of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which probably contribute to the different steroid sensitivities </plain></SENT>
