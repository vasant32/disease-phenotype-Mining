<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) accounts for 6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and is generally considered incurable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although high response rates can be achieved with initial chemotherapy, median survival is only 3-4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intensified consolidation with high-dose therapy (HDT) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has been reported to improve progression-free survival (PFS), but most patients eventually relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> accounts for 35% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL and is associated with a median survival of 9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, it is also generally considered incurable, and the PFS also appears to be improved following HDT/ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We initiated a pilot study to evaluate idiotype (Id) vaccination following HDT and ASCT for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, indolent, and transformed NHL to evaluate the ability of Id-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) to induce immune responses, and to evaluate overall survival (OS) and PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We treated 15 patients: 8 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, 4 with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 1 with small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 2 with transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of approximately 6.3 years (range: 1-9), PFS and OS at 9.05 years from time of ASCT are 59% and 52%, respectively </plain></SENT>
