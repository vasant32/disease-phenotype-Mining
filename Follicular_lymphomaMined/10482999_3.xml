<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The feasibility and efficacy of a novel immunomagnetic ex vivo negative purging method was evaluated on peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) from 13 non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients (eight follicular, FL; three mantle cell, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>; two FL with histologic transformation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A peculiar feature of the study was the collection of PBPC after prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> debulking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our method included a stem cell enrichment phase followed by cell incubation with anti-B cell MoAbs (anti-CD19, CD20, CD22, CD23), addition of immunobeads, and then positive cell removal by passage on a Max-Sep (Baxter Immunotherapy) cell separator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Engraftment was rapid and stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hematological values were assessed 1 and 2 years after the autograft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Purging efficacy was molecularly assessed in a panel of 11 patients who showed persistence of PCR-detectable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells on PBPC harvests despite intensified chemotherapeutic debulking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PCR-negativity was obtained in vitro and persisted in vivo after autograft in three FL patients; five more FL patients, whose purged PBPC were PCR+, converted to stable (3 patients) or fluctuating (two patients) PCR negativity after autograft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> patients never reached PCR negativity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, ex vivo purging may have a role for FL patients harvesting PCR-positive PBPC after intensified chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the addition of ex vivo purging seems to be of little if any benefit for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
