<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transformation to a more aggressive histology (TLy) is a major cause of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The critical events leading to TLy are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the prognostic significance of secondary cytogenetic alterations on overall survival (OS) and transformation from 210 diagnostic FL biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed serial and transformed karyotypes for recurrent alterations that predict transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over 10 years, 31% of cases developed TLy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The only alteration in diagnostic karyotypes that correlated with an inferior OS was an additional X chromosome in males only (P = 0.005) suggesting that other mechanisms including epigenetic factors and over-expression of genes on the X chromosome may play a role in FL pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In transformed karyotypes, 8q24 (MYC) translocations were common (14/37) and resulted in a median survival of 3 months posttransformation (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In serially obtained biopsies (28 pts), 43% of the later biopsies lacked the cytogenetic alterations found in the original FL karyotype, suggesting that karyotypic progression of FL is not strictly linear in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consequently, studying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> in FL using serial biopsies may not represent the full complexity of genetic alterations leading to transformation </plain></SENT>
