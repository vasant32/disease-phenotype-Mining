<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies indicated that the bcl-2 gene product has an ability to block <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To facilitate the analysis of the role of this gene in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development using an animal model, we have isolated and partially characterized the chicken homologue of human bcl-2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analysis of nucleotide sequence showed that the organization of the chicken bcl-2 gene is very similar to that of human bcl-2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary transcript is spliced to encode a 25,687 dalton (233 a.a.) protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The chicken Bcl-2 protein has two regions highly homologous to human Bcl-2 protein surrounding a totally non-homologous region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of the chicken bcl-2 gene was analyzed in various chicken tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the adult chicken, bcl-2 transcripts were detected in thymus, spleen, kidney, heart, ovary and brain, with the highest levels being detected in the thymus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the bursa of Fabricius, which is the site of early B cell development, expressed much less amounts of bcl-2 RNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in embryo, the gene is extensively expressed in the bursa, as well as in muscle and the above tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that a homologue of the human bcl-2 gene does exist in the chicken and that its expression is developmentally regulated in some tissues </plain></SENT>
