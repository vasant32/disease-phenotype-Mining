<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ASCT is usually not curative, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Myeloablative allogeneic transplantation has produced long-term survival at a cost of significant transplantation-related mortality (TRM), whereas reduced-intensity transplantation entails less TRM but has a higher relapse rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We thus initiated a protocol consisting of ASCT followed by nonmyeloablative allogeneic transplantation (NMT) for relapsed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to mimic myeloablative allogeneic transplantation without the associated toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The NMT was non-T cell-depleted, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> donors were HLA-identical siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report results in 27 patients with a median age of 49 years (range, 34-65 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients demonstrated histological progression toward an aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients had received a median of 3 lines of previous therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Disease status before ASCT included 8 patients in complete remission, 14 in partial remission, and 5 refractory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients developed grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>, and 20 patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> requiring systemic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 39 months after NMT, overall survival and progression-free survival were 96% at 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the combined ASCT-NMT strategy appears to be safe, with excellent progression-free survival even in refractory and transformed cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This novel approach warrants further investigation in larger prospective studies </plain></SENT>
