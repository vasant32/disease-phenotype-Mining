<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is considerable debate as to whether immunotactoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0100820'>glomerulopathy</z:hpo> should be distinguished from fibrillary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo>, a closely related entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, the distinction is based on fibril size and arrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 59-year-old woman in whom a diagnosis of immunotactoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0100820'>glomerulopathy</z:hpo> was made after a 2-year history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy of her renal biopsy showed randomly arranged microtubular subepithelial and mesangial deposits, which measured 34 nm in average diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She was later discovered to have circulating immunoglobulin G heavy chains without associated light chains (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018854" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gamma-heavy-chain disease</z:e>) and, subsequently, non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, grade I (World Health Organization classification) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Approximately 100 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018854" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gamma-heavy-chain disease</z:e> have been reported in the literature since it was originally described by Franklin in 1964 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, while there are 10 reports in the literature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018852" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heavy-chain disease</z:e> with fibrillary deposits in the kidney, none fit the criteria for immunotactoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0100820'>glomerulopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
