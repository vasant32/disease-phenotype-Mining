<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The t(14;18)(q32;q21) chromosomal translocation is found in the majority of nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and in a lower percentage of systemic high-grade diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The translocation results in the juxtaposition of the bcl-2 gene on chromosome 18 with the immunoglobulin heavy chain joining region on chromosome 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 protein prevents <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and the translocation leads to overexpression of a functionally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Bcl-2 protein that prevents <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of our study was to analyse cases of primary cutaneous B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (PCBCL) for the presence of the t(14;18) translocation and to correlate the results with Bcl-2 expression and histological subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-four cutaneous B-cell lymphoid proliferations (36 PCBCL, four follicular B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with cutaneous presentation and four reactive B-cell infiltrates) were analysed by polymerase chain reaction amplification and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis using consensus primers for the joining region on the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene in combination with either a primer for the major breakpoint region (MBR) or the minor cluster region (mcr) on chromosome 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: None of 36 PCBCL analysed demonstrated a t(14;18) translocation; however, three of four systemic follicular B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> presenting in the skin were found to have a translocation in the MBR, which was confirmed by sequence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correlation with Bcl-2 immunostaining showed that of seven patients with high-grade cutaneous diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, four were Bcl-2 positive but had no evidence of a t(14;18) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the five cases classified as primary cutaneous follicle centre cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the neoplastic cells within the germinal centres failed to express Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, Bcl-2-positive neoplastic cells were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four cases of systemic follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, including the case that did not show a t(14;18) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> the marginal zone lymphocytes were Bcl-2 positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the t(14;18) translocation does not occur in PCBCL, which suggests the involvement of different pathogenetic mechanisms compared with their nodal counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the detection of a t(14;18) translocation in cutaneous B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> should suggest the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e>, which underlies the need for exhaustive staging procedures </plain></SENT>
