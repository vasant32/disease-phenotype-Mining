<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The impact of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> susceptibility and pathogenesis has gained enormous attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)-based genotyping facilitates the analysis of short DNA amplicons and is, therefore, a promising tool for the investigation of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples, particularly in targeted genotyping analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To examine the applicability of genotyping FFPE DNA with MALDI-TOF MS in multiplex reactions, we investigated five DNA samples extracted from FFPE <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> specimens from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients using different extraction methods (<z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="59" ids="35255">chloroform</z:chebi>, commercial kit) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one SNPs from 25 genes, integrated in different-sized multiplex assays (7-plex, 10-plex, 14-plex, 24-plex), were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate the reliability of genotyping <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-derived DNA extracted from FFPE tissue, we examined 64 FFPE <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> specimens in comparison with matched germline DNA samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Call rates of 99.6 (274/275) and 93.5% (257/275) were observed for the DNA extracted with the <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="59" ids="35255">chloroform</z:chebi> approach or the commercial extraction kit, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increasing the number of SNPs per assay resulted in reduced genotyping call rates and genotyping quality, especially in the DNA samples isolated with the commercial extraction kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When comparing the genotypes of DNA derived from germline and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> (FFPE) specimens, a perfect concordance rate of 100% was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data delineate that MALDI-TOF-based genotyping of FFPE DNA is reliable and reproducible even in multiplex reactions, enabling the retrospective investigation of FFPE study cohorts in future experiments </plain></SENT>
