<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The natural history of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is believed not to have changed over the last 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Median survivals have ranged from 7 to 10 years, and the disease is considered incurable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, multiple new treatment options have been developed in the last decade, and their impact on survival of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the current analysis, we identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> previously untreated, advanced-stage, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients treated with the following three sequential treatment approaches: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHOP) chemotherapy +/- nonspecific immunostimulants (Southwest <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group [SWOG] 7426 and 7713: 1974 to 1983); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (ProMACE) plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925">mechlorethamine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, procarbazine, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (MOPP) +/- interferon (SWOG 8809: 1988 to 1994); and CHOP followed by monoclonal antibody (MoAb) therapy (SWOG 9800 and 9911: 1998 to 2000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed the patients' progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MoAb trials included CHOP followed by rituximab (SWOG 9800) and CHOP followed by (131)I-tositumomab (SWOG 9911) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The PFS curves for the CHOP and ProMACE-MOPP studies are overlapping, with 4-year PFS estimates of 46% and 48%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the PFS rate of the CHOP + MoAb studies is significantly improved at 61% (P = .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The OS curves show improvement with each succeeding study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 4-year estimate of OS is 69% for the CHOP regimens, 79% for the ProMACE-MOPP study, and 91% for the CHOP + MoAb regimens (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These conclusions were retained after adjusting for differences in prognostic factors between the study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that OS for patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has improved over time and that the choice of initial therapy may matter </plain></SENT>
