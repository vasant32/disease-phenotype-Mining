<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been considered that gastric large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> mainly consists of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (MALToma) with large cell transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, debate continues about the cell lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 61 operated cases of gastric B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mainly focusing on 40 cases of diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistologically, two cases were classified as CD10-positive follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 19 cases were low-grade MALToma, 11 CD10-negative DLCL with a component of low-grade MALToma (high-grade MALToma), 12 CD10-positive DLCL, and 17 CD10-negative DLCL without MALToma (pure DLCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lymphoepithelial lesion (LEL) was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> -cases of high-grade MALToma, and in eight of these its invasion was confined to the mucosa and submucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of Bcl-6 was detected in two cases of high-grade MALToma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only two cases of CD10-positive DLCL had large cell LEL, and seven cases showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion beyond the submucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 12 cases were positive for Bcl-6, and a delicate meshwork of CD35 (Ber-MAC-DRC)-positive follicular dendritic cells was detected in eight cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pure DLCL of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 17 cases reached the proper muscle layer or more, and expression of Bcl-6 was detected in 10 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For patients with pure DLCL, overall survival was significantly (p &lt;0.05) worse than those of high-grade MALToma and CD10-positive DLCL by Kaplan-Meier and log-rank methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical staging and Bcl-6 expression were also good prognostic factors in patients with DLCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three groups of gastric DLCL each had unique histologic findings, immunohistologic characteristics, and prognosis </plain></SENT>
