<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are few studies in the literature studying the yield of the diagnostic splenectomy in a suspicious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, their relevance is limited owing to low number of cases, the use of selection criteria, and the lack of modern ancillary studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a histopathological review of splenectomy specimens referred as a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical charts and laboratory data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> splenectomy specimens between the years 2003 and 2008 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphological and immunohistochemical features were analyzed and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were sub-typed in accordance to 2008 WHO Classification of Hematolymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry immunophenotyping available in few cases was correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 46 cases studied included splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e>) (19 cases), splenic diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) (14 cases), splenic diffuse red pulp B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DRP) (five cases), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (three cases), hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (HCL) (two cases), HCL variant (HCLv) (1 case), 1 case of hepatosplenic gamma delta T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (TCL), and 1 cases of TCL (not otherwise specified) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Predominantly splenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is a biologically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> entity, ranging from low-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e> to high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TCLs constituted only 4% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> our cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DRP, HCL, and HCLv have similar diffuse red pulp patterns of splenic involvement and are differentiated based on flow cytometric immunophenotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We had a large number of splenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and none of these involved bone marrow (BM), while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes had BM involvement (stage IV disease) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Morphological and immunophenotypic (immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry) features of BM and splenectomy specimen need to be correlated to differentiate these rare though similar-looking entities with overlapping features </plain></SENT>
