<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One hundred sixty-three patients with advanced non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> including adult T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ATL) were treated from 1981 to 1983 with VEPA (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>) or VEPA-M (VEPA plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>) in randomized fashion after stratification by surface marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The complete response (CR) rate and the 4-year survival rate of patients treated with VEPA-M was 62.2% and 36.9%, respectively, while for those treated with VEPA the rates were 51.9% and 26.6, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The difference was not statistically significant, but pretreatment characteristics predictive for response and survival were interesting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three factors, leukemic change, poor performance status (PS), and T cell marker, were negatively associated with both CR and survival rates, and high-grade pathology was adversely associated with survival rate in a multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These prognostic factors are somewhat different from those in Western <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This may be reflection of major differences in patients' characteristics between Japanese and Western <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>: in this study, there was a high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005517'>T cell lymphoma/leukemia</z:hpo> (50%) including ATL (33%), leukemic manifestation (34%), poor PS (34%), and a low incidence of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The statistically significant three factors for both CR and survival rates were used to construct a model containing eight categories of patients at increasing risk for poor response and shortened survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These categories were divided into four groups, with respective CR and 4-year survival rates of 91% and 73%, 67% and 35%, 27% and 7%, and 10% and 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ninety-three patients in whom CR was induced by VEPA or VEPA-M therapy were evaluated for prognostic factors predictive for disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A shorter period (less than 28 days) required to achieve CR, a clinical diagnosis of ATL, and a lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level were found to affect disease-free survival adversely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results have important implications for both the design of prospective randomized therapeutic trials and the determination of optimal therapy for individual patients </plain></SENT>
