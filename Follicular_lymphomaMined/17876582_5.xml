<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is a disease that responds to current treatment regimens; however, patients in general relapse with increasingly refractory disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Idiotype-based vaccines are currently under trial for the treatment of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These vaccines comprise the patient's BCR idiotype (Id) as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> antigen conjugated to the protein carrier Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH); however, other protein carriers may enhance the immune response to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Id </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated whether an alternate carrier, Listeriolysin O (LLO), would amplify the immune response to Id protein and provide better protection against challenge by 38C13 murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Id-LLO vaccine compared favorably against Id-KLH in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-protection studies and both vaccines provided systemic immunity against 38C13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the immune response to the two conjugates was different in that Id-LLO induced a more powerful Th1 response characterized by high titer IgG2a anti-Id antibodies after one immunization and the presence of CD4 cells secreting IFN-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo studies demonstrated that immune serum contributed to the anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> efficacy seen following Id-LLO immunization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Id-LLO immunized mice, when challenged twice with 38C13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> provided better protection against challenge by the BCR loss variant 38C13-V2, suggesting that Id-LLO immunized mice have more potential to develop <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> spreading than Id-KLH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, Id-LLO compared favorably against Id-KLH in its anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Id-LLO induced a more potent humoral and cell-mediated immune response and promoted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> spreading after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, anti-Id vaccines incorporating LLO may be a better therapeutic option for treatment of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
