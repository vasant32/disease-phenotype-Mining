<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A multi-center series of 117 patients with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were analyzed to evaluate the clinical significance of soluble interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain (sIL-2R alpha) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The initial levels of sIL-2R alpha ranged from 277 U/ml to 22,800 U/ml with a mean level of 3,451 +/- 4,268 U/ml and a median level of 1,600 U/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sIL-2R alpha levels of the diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/intermediate-grade subtypes defined by the LSG classification/Working Formulation were higher than those of the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/low-grade subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a tendency for B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> to show higher sIL-2R alpha levels than T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sIL-2R alpha level was correlated with the Ann Arbor clinical stage (I, II versus III, IV), presence or absence of B symptoms, and performance status (0, 1 versus 2, 3, 4) of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sIL-2R alpha levels were in good accordance with the four risk groups defined by the International Prognostic Indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 21 patients whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden was serially measured, the coefficients of correlation between sIL-2R alpha and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> mass were &gt; 0.6 in 18 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two patients achieved complete remission (CR) during the study; the initial and minimum sIL-2R alpha levels were lower than those of the non-CR patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study confirmed that sIL-2R alpha is a convenient and useful marker in the management of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
