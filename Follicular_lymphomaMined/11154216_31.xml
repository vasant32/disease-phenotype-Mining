<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because young patients have the greatest compromise in longevity, the efficacy and toxicity of high-dose radiochemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation after conventional chemotherapy was evaluated in a prospective phase II clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients in a minimal disease state after conventional chemotherapy received fractionated total body irradiation and high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, followed by purged autologous bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A reference sample of 188 patients of similar age, stage, and histology managed at this institution before 1988 was identified for comparison of patient characteristics and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with reference patients, transplant recipients had a higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 6.5 years, the estimated 10-year survival after transplantation was 86% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a single <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> yielding a 10-year disease-specific survival of 97% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 2 early transplant-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and 2 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten patients relapsed, one with microscopic disease only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden at diagnosis and incomplete response to chemotherapy adversely influenced survival in the reference but not in the transplanted patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The estimated risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of 14% and relapse of 30% at 10 years in our transplanted follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, the majority of whom had high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burdens, compares favorably with our observations in appropriately matched reference patients </plain></SENT>
