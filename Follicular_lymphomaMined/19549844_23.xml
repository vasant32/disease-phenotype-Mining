<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The biological function of BCL6 is only partially understood because no more than a few genes have been functionally characterized as direct targets of BCL6 transrepression activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report that the anti-apoptotic proto-oncogene BCL2 is a direct target of BCL6 in GC B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BCL6 binds to the BCL2 promoter region by interacting with the transcriptional activator Miz1 and suppresses Miz1-induced activation of BCL2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BCL6-mediated suppression of BCL2 is lost in FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, where the 2 proteins are pathologically coexpressed, because of BCL2 chromosomal translocations and other mechanisms, including Miz1 deregulation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in the BCL2 promoter region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results identify an important function for BCL6 in facilitating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of GC B cells via suppression of BCL2, and suggest that blocking this pathway is critical for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
