<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recently, decrease of immunoglobulin concentrations or neutrophil counts were reported in some cases several months after administration of rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined a number of episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> or immunoglobulin decrease in patients with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who were in complete remission following autologous transplantation with or without rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> transplanted with or without rituximab in our institutes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin concentrations and neutrophil counts after transplantation, both with and without rituximab were measured serially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four weeks after transplantation, blood samples revealed lower concentrations of IgG and IgA in the rituximab group than in the non-rituximab group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil numbers did not fall below 0.5x10(9) /L four weeks or more after transplantation in the non-rituximab group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil numbers dropped below 0.5x10(9) /L in 6 of 14 cases in the rituximab group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the present study was retrospective and disease composition and pre-transplantation regimens differed between the two groups, the addition of rituximab to autologous transplantation might bring about a decrease of immunoglobulin levels and transient LON </plain></SENT>
