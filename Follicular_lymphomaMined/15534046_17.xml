<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no data are available in the literature with regard to (18)F-FDG PET for evaluation of the treatment response in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with gastrointestinal tract (GIT) involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to investigate the usefulness of (18)F-FDG PET in monitoring the response to the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 19 patients with different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (10 diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 4 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 3 mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and 2 Hodgkin's disease) involving GIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 19 patients, 4 had gastric involvement, 13 had small bowel involvement, and 2 had small bowel plus colon involvement by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent (18)F-FDG PET before and after the completion of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of (18)F-FDG PET were compared with the results of CT and clinical outcome; the presence of relapse was determined on the basis of positive biopsy results or clinical follow-up data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 19 posttreatment PET scans, 13 showed no pathologic (18)F-FDG uptake, whereas 6 showed persistent (18)F-FDG uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 13 patients who had negative PET scans, only 1 patient (7.7%) relapsed, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 patients (100%) who had persistent abnormal (18)F-FDG uptake on posttherapy PET scans relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Posttreatment CT scans were negative for 10 patients but showed persistent disease in the remaining 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the 10 patients who had negative CT scans, 9 remained in remission and 1 (10%) relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 9 patients who showed persistent disease, 6 (67%) relapsed and 3 (33%) remained in remission after the mean follow-up of 20 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of posttherapy (18)F-FDG PET were 86%, 100%, 100%, 92%, and 95%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The corresponding values for CT were 67%, 75%, 75%, 90%, and 79%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with positive (18)F-FDG PET results had statistically significantly lower disease-free survival (DFS) (0%) than did those with positive CT results (33%) (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in DFS between patients with negative (18)F-FDG PET results and patients with negative CT results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A positive (18)F-FDG PET scan after the completion of chemotherapy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with GIT involvement is a strong predictor of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>(18)F-FDG PET has higher diagnostic accuracy than CT in the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Despite the mild physiologic (18)F-FDG uptake in the GIT, (18)F-FDG PET has potential value in monitoring the response to treatment in patients with GIT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, particularly when pretreatment PET results are positive </plain></SENT>
