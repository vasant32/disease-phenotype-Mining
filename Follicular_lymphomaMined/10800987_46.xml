<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incidence of indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in the lymph nodes and extranodal regions is quite different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is most common in the nodes, and it seems to be least common in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, where mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> arises most frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors report that the incidence of FL is unexpectedly high in the duodenum compared with other portions of the GI tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FL was detected in only eight of 222 cases of GI <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (3.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, five cases of FL arose in the duodenum, which accounted for 38.5% of 13 duodenal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only in two patients did FL arise in either the stomach or the colorectum, and in the remaining patients FL was widespread with lymphomatous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Duodenal FL was composed of neoplastic follicles with small cleaved cells in dominance, and the immunophenotype of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells was CD10+, BCL-2+, CD20+, CD75+, CD79+, CD3-, CD5-, cyclin D1-, CD23-, and CD45RO- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were women age 37 to 66 years (average age, 52.4 yrs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was present around the ampulla of Vater, and four of five patients showed multiple small-size <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell infiltration was confined to the submucosa in the four patients examined, the regional lymph nodes were involved partially in two patients without distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients are alive at 2 to 50 months of follow up (average, 27 mos), which is comparable with the prognosis for indolent nodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the duodenum has a distinct background of histogenesis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and that biopsy specimens from the duodenum with multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> should be examined carefully </plain></SENT>
