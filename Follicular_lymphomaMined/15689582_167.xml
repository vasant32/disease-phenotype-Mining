<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Advanced-stage follicular B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is considered incurable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anti-CD20 radioimmunotherapy is effective in patients who have had a relapse after chemotherapy or who have refractory follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but it has not been tested in previously untreated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-six patients with stage III or IV follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> received as initial therapy a single course of treatment with 131I-tositumomab therapy (registered as Tositumomab and <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">Iodine</z:chebi> I 131 Tositumomab [the Bexxar therapeutic regimen]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This consisted of a dosimetric dose of tositumomab and 131I-labeled tositumomab followed one week later by a therapeutic dose, delivering 75 cGy of radiation to the total body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-five percent of the patients had any response, and 75 percent had a complete response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect rearrangement of the BCL2 gene showed molecular responses in 80 percent of assessable patients who had a clinical complete response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 5.1 years, the actuarial 5-year progression-free survival for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 59 percent, with a median progression-free survival of 6.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The annualized rate of relapse progressively decreased over time: 25 percent, 13 percent, and 12 percent during the first, second, and third years, respectively, and 4.4 percent per year after three years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 57 patients who had a complete response, 40 remained in remission for 4.3 to 7.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hematologic toxicity was moderate, with no patient requiring transfusions or hematopoietic growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> have been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A single one-week course of 131I-tositumomab therapy as initial treatment can induce prolonged clinical and molecular remissions in patients with advanced follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
