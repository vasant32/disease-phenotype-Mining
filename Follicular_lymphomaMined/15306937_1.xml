<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about antigen preservation in the infarcted lymphoid tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FLs eventually transformed to diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, comprising a significant proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To examine the antigen preservation of the follicular center cell markers in the infarcted <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we studied 7 DLBCLs and 4 FLs diagnosed concurrently with or following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lymph node infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sections of viable and infarcted tissue were immunostained in parallel by using a panel of antibodies effective in routinely processed, wax-embedded tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The panel included L26 (CD20), 56C6 (CD10), 124 (BCL-2), and polyclonal BCL-6 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present study indicated that CD20 (91%) and CD10 (80%) antigen appear to be well preserved even in infarcted <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissues and provide useful information regarding the infarcted material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, BCL-2 (40%) and BCL-6 (0%) antigens were of little or no value in the infarcted lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
