<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, by using a probe for the nuclear DNA repair enzyme poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase gene, a pseudogene was found on the long arm of chromosome 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RFLP analysis demonstrates the presence of a common "A" allele and a rare "B" allele, which has a deletion of approximately 200 bp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This deletion occurs more frequently in blacks than in whites in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, Burkitt's and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, there is a marked increased frequency of the expression of the B allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, we have analyzed the frequency of this allele in another B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM), which is also more frequently observed in blacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We studied 97 patients with MM (41 black and 56 white patients) and 30 patients with the related disorder <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278494" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MGUS">monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MGUS</z:e>; 13 black and 17 white patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that the overall frequency of B allele expression (37%) is higher than in a noncancer control population (23%; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This difference is mainly due to the much higher frequency of B expression in black patients (52 versus 35% in black controls; P &lt; 0.01), whereas there is no significant difference in white patients (18 versus 14% in white controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, B allelic frequency is similar in patients with MM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MGUS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Matched germline and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> DNA show identical patterns of expression of these alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest germline B allelic expression predisposes one to MM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MGUS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
