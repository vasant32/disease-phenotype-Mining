<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was visually quantified by the in situ end-labeling (ISEL) method, and the expression of Fas, Le(y) antigens and bcl-2 protein was examined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of Le(y) antigen was observed in germinal centers of RHL and 45% of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The apoptotic cell count (AC) in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was significantly less than that in diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The distribution pattern of apoptotic cells in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was inverse to that in RHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, AC was lower in follicles than in interfollicular areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, AC was higher in follicles than in interfollicular areas in RHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Le(y) antigen-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed a significantly higher AC than the negative cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Fas antigen-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed a higher AC than the negative cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, AC in bcl-2 protein-positive and negative cases was not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Ley and Fas antigens appear to be involved in the apoptotic tendency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, whereas bcl-2 does not necessarily </plain></SENT>
