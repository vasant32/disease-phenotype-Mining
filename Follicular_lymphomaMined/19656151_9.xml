<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fludarabine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> were escalated in cohorts of three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rituximab was added to the maximum tolerated dose of fludarabine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> and added significant dose-limiting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical responses were observed in 11 patients, five of whom were refractory to their most recent treatment regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six additional patients had stable disease for a median of 10 months (range 4-30+) </plain></SENT>
