<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors examined body size measurements and recreational physical activity in relation to risk of B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) in the prospective California Teachers Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between 1995 and 2007, 574 women were diagnosed with incident B-cell NHL among 121,216 eligible women aged 22-84 years at cohort entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariable-adjusted relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were estimated by fitting Cox proportional hazards models for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B-cell NHL combined and for the 3 most common subtypes: diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Height was positively associated with risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B-cell NHLs (for &gt;1.70 vs. 1.61-1.65 m, relative risk = 1.50, 95% confidence interval: 1.16, 1.96) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (relative risk = 1.93, 95% confidence interval: 1.09, 3.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Weight and body mass index at age 18 years were positive predictors of B-cell NHL risk overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that greater height, which may reflect genetics, early life immune function, infectious exposures, nutrition, or growth hormone levels, may play a role in NHL etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Adiposity</z:e> at age 18 years may be more relevant to NHL etiology than that in later life </plain></SENT>
