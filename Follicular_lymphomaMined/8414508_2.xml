<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first rearrangement interested the major breakpoint region (mbr) on chromosome 18 and a JH segment on chromosome 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The other one was located at the 5' end of the BCL2 gene, in the so called variant cluster region (vcr), and consisted of a series of deletions that removed part of a DNA region where initiation of transcription normally occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, both rearrangements involved the same BCL2 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The simultaneous presence of mbr (or mcr) translocations and of minor rearrangements in vcr has been previously suggested by restriction map analysis in a significant number of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The significance of these abnormalities on the oncogenic process is discussed </plain></SENT>
