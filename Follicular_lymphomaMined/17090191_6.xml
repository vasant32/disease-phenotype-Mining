<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONTEXT: Pleural involvement by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is relatively common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are very few clinicopathologic studies reported in the literature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> involving the pleura </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterize the clinicopathologic features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> involving the pleura </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We reviewed the clinicopathologic features of 34 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involving the pleura proven by biopsy and classified these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> using the World Health Organization classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 22 men and 12 women, with an average age of 62 years (range, 22-82 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine (26.5%) patients had pleural involvement as the only site of disease, 22 (64.7%) had other sites of involvement, and 3 (8.8%) had inadequate staging data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen (56.2%) of 32 patients with adequate clinical data had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (including 3 patients with pleural involvement as the only disease site) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 29 (85.3%) cases, a specific diagnosis according to the World Health Organization classification could be made: 17 (58.6%) diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 5 (17.2%) follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (including a case with areas of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), 2 (6.9%) small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, 2 (6.9%) precursor T-cell lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, 1 (3.4%) mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 1 (3.4%) posttransplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo>, and 1 (3.4%) classical Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other 5 cases were B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that could not be further classified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cytologic examination of pleural fluid was performed in 15 cases and was positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 8 (53.3%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involving the pleura have simultaneous evidence of systemic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most frequent type is diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, followed by follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cytologic examination can have negative results in patients with pleural involvement by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
