<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-six patients (33 men and 33 women) with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> underwent staging with integrated CT and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49134">fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose</z:chebi> ((18)FDG) PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> types were diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=26, 39%), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=20, 30%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e> (n=16, 24%), and marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=4, 6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both non-contrasted PET/CT and contrast-enhanced PET/CT images were examined separately by two different qualified physicians for each imaging modality, and nodal status of pelvic and retroperitoneal lymphatic pathways was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reference standard included follow-up with clinical, laboratory, and conventional CT findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared diagnostic accuracy retrospectively on basis of per-patient and per-lesion analyses between two modalities using McNemar test, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nodal status of pelvic and retroperitoneal lymphatic pathways was more accurately determined on contrast-enhanced PET/CT (n=52, 79%) compared with non-contrasted PET/CT (n=47, 71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Difference in the accuracy of nodal staging between non-contrasted PET/CT and contrast-enhanced PET/CT was significant (p=0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On basis of per-lesion analysis, contrast-enhanced PET/CT determined more accurately the status of external iliac lymph node (p=0.002), internal iliac lymph node (p&lt;0.0001), and common iliac lymph node (p=0.002) compared with non-contrasted PET/CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic accuracies of paraaortic lymph node, aortocaval lymph node, and paracaval lymph node were similar by either non-contrasted PET/CT or contrast-enhanced PET/CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Integrated contrast-enhanced PET/CT improves the diagnostic accuracy in evaluating nodal status of pelvic and retroperitoneal lymphatic pathways in patients with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
