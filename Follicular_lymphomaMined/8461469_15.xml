<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The illegitimate recombination occurs in early B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While V(D)J-recombinase is most likely involved on the chromosome 14 part, little is known about the mechanism of breakage on chromosome 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the BCL-2 breakpoint regions for their structural vulnerability and protein binding capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the major breakpoint region (mbr) contains an S1 nuclease-sensitive site and is the target of an endogenous nuclease present in early B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 45 Kd nuclear protein (bp45) from early B cell extracts binds to a homopurine-homopyrimidine stretch (GGGAGGACGGGAGGAAGGCG) in the mbr, which is homologous to a recombinatorial element in Escherichia coli (CHI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The protein also binds to homologous sequences in the minor breakpoint cluster region (mcr) and in the IgH locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The localization of the binding sites on both chromosomes as well as the tissue distribution of bp45 suggest that this protein-DNA interaction is involved in the translocation t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The DNA binding motif is also present at other translocation breakpoints indicating a more general role for this mechanism </plain></SENT>
