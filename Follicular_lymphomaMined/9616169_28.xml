<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are thought to arise from the follicle center B cells and are characterized by follicular structures that recapitulate many features of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> secondary lymphoid follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The neoplastic B cells of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> reside not only in follicles but also in the interfollicular zone in which they form a diffuse infiltrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the frequency, extent, and biological characteristics of this interfollicular component in 30 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An interfollicular B-cell infiltrate of variable extent (minimal, moderate, or prominent) was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphologically interfollicular neoplastic B cells were small centrocyte-like cells with lower grade cytology and lower proliferation fraction compared with the neoplastic follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neoplastic phenotype of these cells (CD20+, light chain restricted) was confirmed in 18 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clonal identity between the follicular and interfollicular components was shown in five cases using microdissection and PCR amplification of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of Ig heavy chain gene sequences showed identical variants of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> subclones in both follicular and interfollicular compartments, indicating active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell traffic between the two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In six cases in which frozen tissue was available, the immunophenotype of follicular and interfollicular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were compared using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Activation markers such as CD10, CD38, and CD95 and T-cell costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86, which were expressed by neoplastic follicles, were either downregulated or absent in the interfollicular component in most of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The low-grade cytological features, low proliferation fraction, and downregulation of activation markers in the interfollicular neoplastic B cells suggests that these are resting cells analogous to memory B cells of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presence of such a resting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell subpopulation in the majority of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> may partly account for the remarkable resistance to therapy of this disease </plain></SENT>
