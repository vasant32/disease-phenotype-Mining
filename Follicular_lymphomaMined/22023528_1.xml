<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we performed a phase II trial to determine the safety and effectiveness of IFN-α and standard <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi>, vinblastine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4305">dacarbazine</z:chebi> (ABVD) chemotherapy (IABVD) in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with newly diagnosed advanced stage classic Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>) were enrolled between July 1997 and March 2000 on IABVD as initial therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This consisted of six cycles of ABVD with concurrent IFN-α followed by radiation therapy if indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IFN-α 6 million IU/m(2) was administered subcutaneously daily for 3 days and on day 4 patients received IFN-α with ABVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Courses were repeated every 2 weeks for a maximum of 12 courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IFN-α dose reduction was allowed for cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Outcome and baseline characteristics were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients (median age, 30 years [range, 18-62 years]) were evaluable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients had Ann Arbor stage II (7%), III (30%) or IV (63%) disease, and 47% were at intermediate or high risk, as defined by the International Prognostic Score (≤ 2 vs. &gt; 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 3-year event-free survival rate was 71% (95% confidence interval [CI], 56-90%), and the 3-year overall survival rate was 96% (95% CI, 89-100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment was well tolerated, with only three patients requiring IFN-α dose reduction or discontinuation because of cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IABVD is an effective regimen against advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> and is well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, because of the emergence of effective new biologic agents, further development of this regimen is not warranted </plain></SENT>
