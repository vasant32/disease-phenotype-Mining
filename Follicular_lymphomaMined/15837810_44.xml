<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myelomas</z:mp> expressed a CDR3 repertoire comparable to that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo> (B-CLLs) expressed clearly restricted albeit different CDR3 repertoires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphomas</z:hpo> of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALTs) were unique as 8 out of 45 (18%) of gastric- and 13 out of 32 (41%) of salivary gland-MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> expressed B cell antigen receptors with strong CDR3 homology to rheumatoid factors (RFs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of note, the RF-CDR3 homology without exception included N-region-encoded residues in the hypermutated IgV(H) genes, indicating that they were stringently selected for reactivity with auto-IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By in vitro binding studies with 10 MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived antibodies, we showed that seven of these cases, of which four with RF-CDR3 homology, indeed possessed strong RF reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of one MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, functional proof for selection of subclones with high RF affinity was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, RF-CDR3 homology and t(11;18) appeared to be mutually exclusive features and RF-CDR3 homology was not encountered in any of the 19 pulmonary MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> studied </plain></SENT>
