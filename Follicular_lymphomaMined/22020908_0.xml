<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of primary gastrointestinal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (GI-FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: From May 1996 to October 2008, the records of five patients diagnosed with primary GI-FL were retrieved from pathological files and retrospectively analyzed in terms of characteristics of endoscopic and clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The five patients consisted of 3 males and 2 females with a median age of 52 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>Abdominal pain</z:hpo> was the most common (n=4, 80%) symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most frequent site was the terminal ileum in the small bowel (n=3, 60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic findings were 3 of mass forming type, 1 of irregular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> type and 1 of whitish granular type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three cases (60%) had a component of diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases received chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While complete remission occurred in every patient, relapse occurred in the two patients with a higher grade and more advanced stage than the other cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up time of 37 months (range, 27-58 months; mean, 38.8 months), four patients (80%) were disease free and one patient had died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In South Korea, primary gastrointestinal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is very rare and symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic findings were variable from early whitish granular lesions to advanced mass forming lesions </plain></SENT>
