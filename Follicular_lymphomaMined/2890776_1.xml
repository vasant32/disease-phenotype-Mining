<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Though PC antibody expression did not seem to correlate well with histologic grading of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, positivity to this was consistently more intense in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Correlation with histologic grading of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was more significant: the high grade types, e.g. ATL, exhibited greater positivity than intermediate grade types, e.g. diffuse medium <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and certainly much more than low grade types, e.g. follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data were compared to another proliferation-associated antigen, the transferrin receptor </plain></SENT>
