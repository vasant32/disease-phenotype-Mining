<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied a diverse group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (CLL), non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp>) to determine if V kappa gene use is random or disease-specific and whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> (a late event in B-cell differentiation) can provide additional information on the type of B cell involved in the neoplastic clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this group of disorders V kappa gene selection is not random and some members of each V kappa family are preferentially rearranged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>V kappa genes from the distal portion of the locus are seldom used, possibly because rearrangement of the proximal locus by deletion is more efficient than rearrangement of the distal locus by inversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although pseudogenes account for 46% of the V genes in the kappa locus none were ever rearranged, even in non-functional rearrangements of lambda-producing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, suggesting the existence of a mechanism which down-regulates the rearrangement of pseudogenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>N regions were noted at the VJ junction in 20% of alleles (in six CLL, three NHL, two ALL and one <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp>) possibly the result of kappa-chain recombination during the early period of B-cell maturation in which TdT is expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nucleotide addition or imprecise joining at the VJ junction, resulting in a shift in the reading frame, were the commonest causes of non-functional rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> broadly correlated with the stage of B-cell maturation from which the different disorders are thought to arise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there was no strict association and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> were demonstrated in 'typical CLL' while V kappa genes were germline in some follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; these findings suggest either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the stage of B-cell maturation at which these disorders arise or some variability in the process of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
