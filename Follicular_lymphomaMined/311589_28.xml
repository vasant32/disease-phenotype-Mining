<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cell suspensions were evaluated for E, EAC, and IgGEA rosette forming cells; Fc receptor cells; and surface immunoglobulin bearing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cryostat section studies topographically defined EAC binding cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytochemical determinations and immunoperoxidase methods for detection of intracellular immunoglobulin and lysozyme complemented other techniques in evaluating infiltrates containing large neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> comprised 58 cases (80%) of this series and included well and moderately well differentiated lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (10/10); nodular (23/23) and diffuse (10/18) poorly differentiated lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of mixed lymphocytic-"histiocytic" (3/3), "undifferentiated" (3/3), and "histiocytic" (9/13) types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were characterized as B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> but also revealed a prominent population of T lymphocytes (39 +/- 12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alkaline phosphatase activity, a cytochemical marker for lymphoid cells of follicular cuffs, was most consistently observed in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of moderately well differentiated lymphocytic type (4/6 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In some diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, cryostat section studies (EAC rosettes) suggested a pre-existing nodular proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One unusual B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of large cell type exhibited IgGEA rosette formation and a strong receptor for the Fc portion of IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (14%) were of T-cell type and were represented by cases of diffuse poorly differentiated lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (5/18, including 3 lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036920" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">SÃ©zary syndrome</z:e> (1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mycosis fungoides</z:e> (1), and a cytologically distinctive large cell ("histiocytic") <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (3/13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Acid phosphatase activity was a consistent marker for the T-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, some of which also revealed alpha-naphthyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> esterase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No true histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three cases of diffuse poorly differentiated lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and one "histiocytic" <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were null </plain></SENT>
