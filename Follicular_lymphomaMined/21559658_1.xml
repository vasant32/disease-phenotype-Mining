<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) is the most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> referred to our institute which is the largest tertiary referral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> centre in Saudi Arabia, The proportion of follicular low grade NHL appears to be extremely small in this population (&lt;5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, there is no data available regarding any correlation between bcl-2 gene rearrangement and different cell types of nodal and extranodal NHLs in Saudi patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a sequential polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to determine the frequency of bcl-2/J(H) recombination occurring via the major breakpoint region (mbr) in 16 GI tract NHLs including 4 MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 13 follicular (nodal) NHLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed only 2/13 (15%) nodal follicular NHLs with bcl-2/J(H) fusion DNA whereas 9/16 (56%) of the extranodal NHLs with at least 2 of them exhibiting MALT characteristics were positive for the bcl-2 gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A breakdown of the proportion of extranodal NHLs of different cell types showing bcl-2 rearrangement via mbr was as follows: 5/8 diffuse large non-cleaved cell (DLNCC), 1/3 diffuse small cleaved cell (DSCC), 1/1 follicular small cleaved cell (FSCC) and 2/4 MALTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The PCR amplified bcl-2/J(H) fusion DNA from 5 randomly selected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (2 MALTs, 1 DLNCC, 1 DSCC and 1 nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) were cloned and sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 5 of them showed different bcl-2/J(H) N-regions confirming the clonality of each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data indicating a very low incidence of bcl-2 translocation in nodal follicular NHLs and a surprisingly high incidence of it in extranodal NHLs are intriguing, and quite contrary to the findings in Western patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These unusual observations warrant further studies and may suggest that different genetic events are involved in the development of extranodal NHLs including MALT and follicular center-cell NHLs in Saudi patients </plain></SENT>
