<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adjuvant chemotherapy was given to 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median follow-up was 9.5 years with a range of 0.5-24.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival, cause-specific survival, freedom from relapse, and event-free survival were 9.5, 18.9, 7.1, and 5.1 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Few initial relapses or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were seen beyond the first decade of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient age and number of disease sites were the two strongest predictors of overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cohort of patients with limited Stage III disease demonstrated an 88% freedom from relapse and a 100% cause-specific survival with up to 23.5 years follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The long-term survival data for Stage III FSC or FM non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated with primary radiotherapy are at least comparable and possibly better than results achieved with other therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with limited Stage III disease do particularly well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whether these results are superior to an initial approach of deferred therapy until clinically indicated is currently unknown </plain></SENT>
