<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To study the clinicopathologic features of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) in the ocular adnexal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The slides of 23 suspect patients were reevaluated with a panel of monoclonal antibodies, including anti-CD20, cyclin-D1, CD5, CD3, and p53 immunostains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients confirmed to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> were examined retrospectively on the basis of chart review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten patients with periocular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> were included in the study on the basis of characteristic histopathologic features and coexpression of nuclear cyclin-D1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This included 1 female and 9 male patients, with an age range of 32 to 84 years (median, 73.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 20 months (range, 5-172 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six of the 10 patients died, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The orbit (90%) was most commonly involved followed by the lacrimal gland (50%) and lid (50%), with 90% of cases having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> present at 2 or more periocular sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most had a primary periocular presentation (80%) that was associated with stage III/IV disease (80%), including atypical cells in the peripheral blood smear (60%) and bone marrow involvement (70%) at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three cases were CD5-negative, and 2 other cases showed composite histologic findings (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> and a plasma cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fluorescent in situ hybridization performed in these 2 cases demonstrated t(11;14) in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survivals were median progression-free (PFS) survival, 12 months; median overall survival (OS), 57 months; 5-year PFS, 0; 5-year OS, 39% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> presenting in the ocular adnexal region has a male predominance and tends to affect an elderly age group, as is typical of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> involving nodal sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A higher frequency of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> fail to co-express CD5, and composite <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were observed in 20% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> presenting in the ocular adnexal region is associated with advanced-stage disease and short PFS but an OS similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> at other sites </plain></SENT>
