<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On cryostat sections <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CBCL</z:e> so tested were positive for surface membrane immunoglobulins (IgMk most often) and B-cell antigens (CD22+, CD37+) with a variable T-cell-reactive component identified by MoAbs against T-cell antigens (CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD4-positive stromal T-cells were usually more numerous than CD8-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A strong (50-75% of total cells) stromal T-cell (CD2+, CD3+) reaction was found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e>-centrocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Small numbers of CD1+ Langerhans cells were found in most cases, but they were present in large numbers in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On paraffin sections, a combination of MoAbs against B-associated antigens (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>-1, MB2) identified B-cell lineage in virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, MT1 and UCHL1 combined identified the T-cell nature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of nonepidermotropic, nonmycosis T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which were initially predictive of B-lineage by histologic pattern </plain></SENT>
