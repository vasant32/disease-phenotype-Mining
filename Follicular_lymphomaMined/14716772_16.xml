<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In in vitro studies, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) was reportedly expressed by human NHL cells and elevated levels of MMP9 have been observed in a subset of patients with high-grade NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The expression of MMP2 and MMP9 was evaluated in 158 patients with NHL and the relation between the expression of these proteins and clinicopathologic factors was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but 1 patient had received radiation therapy and 92 patients also were treated with intensive combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients with extranodal natural killer NK/T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> nasal type and anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, T-cell/null cell type expressed MMP9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only a small fraction of the patients with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> expressed MMP9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Approximately 50% of the diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) cases expressed MMP9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of MMP2 was noted in some of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and nasal NK/T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall survival rates of patients who expressed MMP9 were significantly lower than that of those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such a correlation was not demonstrated in MMP2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When MMP9 expression was analyzed in DLBLC patients, the overall survival rates of patients who expressed MMP9 were significantly lower than those who did not express MMP9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy was associated with better overall survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> patients who expressed MMP9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall survival rates of T-cell/NK-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients who expressed MMP9 appeared to be lower than that in those who did not express MMP9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, chemotherapy was not found to improve overall survival in patients who expressed MMP9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MMP9 expression was observed in patients with aggressive NHL and was characterized by poor overall survival </plain></SENT>
