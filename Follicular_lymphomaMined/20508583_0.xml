<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper we investigate its value in patients affected by follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) before and after treatment with [90Y]Ibritumomab Tiuxetan (Zevalin(R)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated 38 relapsed or refractory FL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had a PET scan performed before and 3months after radioimmunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Final assessment was done 9 months post-RIT, including clinical evaluation, other imaging techniques and/or biopsy, when necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the first PET scan 20 patients out of 38 had a limited disease (nodal involvement on one side of the diaphragm: 7 above and 13 below), 11 patients had nodal findings on both sides of the diaphragm and the remaining 7 patients had both nodal and extra-nodal findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At three months post-RIT, 21 patients (55%) were in complete remission, 13 patients (34%) had a partial response (PR) and four patients (11%) had a progression disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The corresponding rates at final assessment were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consistent with the 3-month evaluation: 55% CR, 13% PR and 32% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FDG PET scan revealed maximal predictive values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When comparing the disease extent at relapse and the response to treatment, we could testify a higher rate of CR (75%) in patients with limited disease, while in patients with diffused nodal and/or extra-nodal findings, it was more frequent a PR or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> (66%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data are concordant with the expected results on RIT, and FDG PET is confirmed to be useful in assessing treatment response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Potential correlation can also be picked out between the disease extent at relapse and the CR rate, with reasonable PET predictivity for the final outcome </plain></SENT>
