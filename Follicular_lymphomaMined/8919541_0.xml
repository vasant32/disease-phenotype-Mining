<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We determined, in a semiquantitative fashion, the level of expression of c-myc in 18 follicular center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and five non-neoplastic lymph nodes using reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction technique (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With this method, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> is extracted from lymph node specimens and reverse-transcribed to produce cDNA, which is then amplified using primers specific for c-myc sequences that span introns, thus precluding amplification of genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Amplified products are compared with beta2-microglobulin sequences co-amplified in each case as a control for the quality of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> extracted, RT, and PCR amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using cell lines derived from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the RT-PCR method yielded results equivalent to standard Northern blot analysis yet required smaller quantities of tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The c-myc transcripts were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases studied (seven high, 11 low expression) and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-neoplastic lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High or low c-myc expression was based on comparison with non-neoplastic lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the RT-PCR method is a sensitive, reliable method for measuring gene expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissues and may be useful for studying the role of c-myc in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
