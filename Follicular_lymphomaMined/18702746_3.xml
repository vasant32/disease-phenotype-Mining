<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab has been used for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with varying responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rituximab has been demonstrated to act by direct complement-dependent cytotoxity (CDC) and by inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, complement-, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we determined whether rituximab's effector mechanisms differed between two human follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines that originate from different maturation stages of B cell germinal centre (GC) development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The tested HF-1 and HF-4b <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells represent GC centrocytes and centroblasts, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both cell lines responded to rituximab treatment by undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> yet the HF-1 cells were more sensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A major difference was seen in the proliferation response as only the proliferation of HF-1 cells was inhibited by rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human serum (NHS) rituximab almost completely inhibited DNA synthesis and induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of both cell lines because of CDC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the CD20-positive HF-1 and HF-4b cells respond differentially to rituximab-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and inhibition of proliferation but similarly to complement-mediated killing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increased sensitivity of the HF-1 cell line to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and inhibition of proliferation may reflect a tendency of centrocytic cells for negative selection and a role for CD20 in this process </plain></SENT>
