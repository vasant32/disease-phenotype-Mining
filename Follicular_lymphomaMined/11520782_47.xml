<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets B-cell-specific antigen CD20 and an effective treatment for B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although it is readily used in clinical practice, the exact mechanism of its antitumor effect is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One potential mechanism involves complement-mediated cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that rituximab induces complement-mediated cytotoxicity in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in vitro, and complement inhibitors CD55 and CD59 may regulate this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine whether complement inhibitors play a role in regulating the antitumor effect of rituximab, the expression of complement inhibitors CD46, CD55, and CD59 was analyzed in pretreatment <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells from 29 rituximab-treated follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among them, 8 patients achieved complete responses, 11 patients achieved partial responses, and 10 patients showed no or minimal responses to rituximab treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of surface CD20, CD46, CD55, and CD59 was determined by 2-color flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the CD59 level was slightly lower in the complete response group, there was no statistically significant difference in the expression of individual complement inhibitor CD46 (mean channel fluorescence [MCF]: NR, 26.4; PR, 21.9; CR, 29.9), CD55 (MCF: NR, 16.4; PR, 14.9; CR, 23.2), or CD59 (MCF: NR, 41.6; PR, 40.6; CR, 30.6), the combination of any 2 inhibitors, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells from 3 response groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was no difference in the rituximab-induced complement-mediated cytotoxicity in an in vitro assay using <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells from 3 response groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, CD46, CD55, and CD59 expression on pretreatment <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, or their susceptibility to in vitro complement-mediated killing, does not predict clinical outcome after rituximab treatment </plain></SENT>
