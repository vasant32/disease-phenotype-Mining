<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty cats were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at necropsy, via biopsy or by cytology alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten cats displayed multiorgan involvement, and in 2 of these the involvement was limited to the cerebellum and frontal cortex, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, 41 of 50 (82%) were classified as nasal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 5 of 50 (10%) were classified as nasopharyngeal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 4 of 50 (8%) involved both nasal and nasopharyngeal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histologically, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were considered diffuse lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and no cats displayed features of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 44 cases available for slide review by the pathologist, 40 of 44 (91%) were classified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 2 of 44 (5%) as diffuse large cell, and 1 as diffuse mixed; 1 was unclassified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 45 cats for which immunohistochemical stains were available, 32 were uniformly positive for CD79a, 7 were uniformly CD3 positive, and 6 had a mixed population of CD79a and CD3 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Epithelioptropism was exhibited in 4 of 5 (80%) cats in which there was sufficient epithelium present for evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of those 4, 3 were B-cell and 1 was a granulated T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the 21 cats which nasal cytology was performed, 15 were cytologically diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; the diagnoses in the remaining five cats were inflammatory (n = 4), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid tissue (n = 1), or nondiagnostic (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
