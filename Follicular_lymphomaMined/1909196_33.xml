<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six randomly selected cases of low grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) were analyzed for Ig heavy chain variable region (VH) gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Assignment to one of the six human VH gene families (VH1 to VH6) was made with a polymerase chain reaction-based technique using family-specific leader primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of VH family use in FL was found to be similar to that reported for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood lymphocytes and is therefore also roughly proportional to VH family size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate expression within an individual family, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> VH genes from the middle size VH4 family were sequenced and compared with previously published sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> VH sequences, six were most closely related to just two of the 10 known functional VH4 germline genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nonrandom usage by FL of the JH3, JH4, and JH5 joining segments was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nucleotide sequences were also determined for 10 randomly selected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> VH genes from the large VH3 family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With one possible exception, none of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> VH sequences appear to represent any of the VH3 genes that may be preferentially used in the fetal repertoire </plain></SENT>
