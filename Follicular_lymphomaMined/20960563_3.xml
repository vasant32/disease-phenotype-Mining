<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In rare instances, combinations of different IGH rearrangements were described, and even coincidence of three genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-specific events has been rarely reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We here present eight patients with triple hit <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and two with four different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> specific events detected by chromosome banding analysis and interphase FISH (seven males, three females, 47-82 years) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had triple hit <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> combining IGH-BCL2/t(14;18)(q32;q21), MYC/8q24, and BCL6/3q27 rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two showed an additional IGH-CCND1/t(11;14)(q13;q32) as fourth genetic event (according to research of the Mitelman database, the first reports on four genetic hits in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases had complex aberrant karyotypes (median, 11 cytogenetic alterations per patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interphase FISH revealed a high rate of CDKN2A deletions (five of nine cases investigated; 56%), being homozygous in two of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the time of study, four of nine patients with follow-up data were alive (44%), one of these in remission </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additional cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with three or four genetic hits should be collected to evaluate whether their clinical course differs from dual hit <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
