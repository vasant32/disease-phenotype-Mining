<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Rituximab has shown a high activity in relapsed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> when given alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Further on, phase-II-studies indicate that its addition to chemotherapy may improve the response rate substantially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, so far, prospective randomized studies have not been available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 1998 the GLSG started a multicenter trial in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A fludarabine-containing regimen (FCM) was chosen for salvage therapy, with fludarabine 25 mg/m(2)/d 1-3, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 200 mg/m(2) d 1-3 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> 8 mg/m(2) d 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of four courses, every 4 weeks were given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were prospectively randomized for FCM alone or the immunochemotherapy with R-FCM (375 mg/m(2) one day before FCM) RESULTS: About 147 randomized patients 93 had follicular, 40 mantle cell and 14 lymphoplasmocytic/-cytoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed by sequential testing and indicated for 94 fully evaluable patients a significant advantage for the R-FCM-arm, with an overall response rate of 83 % as compared to 58%, when treated with FCM alone (CR: 35 % vs. 13 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar improvements of remission rate were detected in the different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subgroups, especially in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> (OR: 65 % vs. 33 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both treatment options were associated with hematological toxicities of grade III and IV, but well tolerated; infectious complications were rare, with no difference between the two treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This prospectively randomized trial demonstrates for the first time a significant improvement of the combined immunochemotherapy related to the remission rate in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
