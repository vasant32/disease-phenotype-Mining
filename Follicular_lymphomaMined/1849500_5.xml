<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The finding of CD30 positive cells in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e>/centrocytic (cb/cc) follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> prompted us to characterize the presence and distribution of CD30 positive cells in this type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, using the monoclonal antibody BerH2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD30 positive cells were present in 17/19 of the cases studied, located mainly at the edge of the neoplastic follicles, but also in some cases in perinodular or T-cell areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This distribution resembles that found in reactive tonsils and lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of these CD30 positive cells in cb/cc <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> seem to be B-cells, as suggested by their reactivity with B-cell markers demonstrated by double immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The nature of these CD30 positive cells is unclear, but they should be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis of cb/cc <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with lymphocyte predominance <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
