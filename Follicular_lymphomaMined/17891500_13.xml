<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the association between polymorphisms in one-carbon metabolism genes and risk of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) in a population-based case-control study in Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cases (n = 561) and controls (n = 506) were genotyped for 14 selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 10 genes (CBS, FPGS, FTHFD, MTHFR, MTHFS, MTR, SHMT1, SLC19A1, TCN1, and TYMS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also conducted a meta-analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies of Caucasian populations investigating the association between MTHFR Ex5+79C &gt; T (a.k.a., 677C&gt;T) and NHL risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A global test of 13 genotypes was statistically significant for diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>; P = 0.008), but not for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL; P = 0.27) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL (P = 0.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The T allele at MTHFR Ex5+79 was marginally significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL (OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 0.98-1.59) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (1.36, 0.96-1.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The T allele at TYMS Ex8+157 was associated with a reduced risk of FL (0.64, 0.46-0.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An elevated risk of NHL was also observed among carriers of the G allele at FTHFD Ex21+31 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL, 1.31, 1.02-1.69; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, 1.50, 1.05-2.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis of 11 studies conducted in Caucasian populations of European origin (4,121 cases and 5,358 controls) supported an association between the MTHFR Ex5+79 T allele and increased NHL risk (additive model, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that genetic polymorphisms of one-carbon metabolism genes such as MTHFR and TYMS may influence susceptibility to NHL </plain></SENT>
