<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Demographic data, signs, symptoms, disease stage, and treatment of the patients diagnosed in National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center Hospital from 1999 to 2007 were collected and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients had stage I disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The histological grade was 1 or 2 in 26 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IgH/BCL2 fusion was shown in 20 of the examined 24 cases (83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients received therapy upon diagnosis (local radiotherapy in 2 patients and chemotherapy in 12 including rituximab therapy), their response rate was 85%, and the estimated progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 3 years was 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient developed histological transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The other 13 patients were followed up; their estimated PFS rate at 3 years was 74% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five among six cases responded to treatment even after progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 27 patients have survived with a median follow-up time of 47.9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of primary DFL patients have a localized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> of low-grade histology and are positive for t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Watchful waiting might be an alternative approach for its indolent course; however, further studies are warranted </plain></SENT>
