<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region on chromosome 6p21.32-33 that are statistically significantly associated with FL risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Low to medium resolution typing of single or multiple HLA genes has provided an incomplete picture of the total genetic risk imparted by this highly variable region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To gain further insight into the role of HLA alleles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> and to investigate the independence of validated SNPs and HLA alleles with FL risk, high-resolution HLA typing was conducted using next-generation sequencing in 222 non-Hispanic White FL cases and 220 matched controls from a larger San Francisco Bay Area population-based case-control study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A novel protective association was found between the DPB1*03:01 allele and FL risk [odds ratio (OR) = 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.21-0.68] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extended haplotypes DRB1*01:01-DQA1*01:01-DQB1*05:01 (OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.22-3.38) and DRB1*15-DQA1*01-DQB1*06 (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.36-0.82) also influenced FL risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, DRB1*15-DQA1*01-DQB1*06 was highly correlated with an established FL risk locus, rs2647012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results provide further insight into the critical roles of HLA alleles and SNPs in FL pathogenesis that involve multi-locus effects across the HLA region </plain></SENT>
