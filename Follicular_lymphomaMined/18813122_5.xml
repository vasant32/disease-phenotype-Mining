<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by a proliferation of dendritic cells, which mimic Langerhans cells immunophenotypically (positive for CD1a and S-100 protein), but lack Birbeck granules characteristic of Langerhans cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical, morphologic, immunophenotypic, and ultrastructural features of 5 ICT cases are reported in an attempt to further define ICT and to examine the postulated relationship between indeterminate cells and Langerhans cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four of 5 patients were females, and 4 of 5 were older than 68 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of 5 patients had cutaneous lesions, whereas 2 presented with cervical lymph node involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients had a possible association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>: first patient had a history of progressive follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that led to patient's demise and the second patient had unexplained systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> and died 1 week after the biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 5 ICT cases expressed CD1a and S-100 protein, but lacked Langerin expression and Birbeck granules ultrastructurally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a t(14;18) was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization in the ICT cells of the patient with previous follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and a monoclonal kappa light chain gene rearrangement was detected by polymerase chain reaction in the patient with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both cases, there was no morphologic or immunophenotypic evidence of a concurrent B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, ICT is a rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> that can occur de novo or in association with a B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, possibly as a result of B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002793" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">dedifferentiation</z:e> caused by relatively unknown mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, Langerin immunostaining may be used as a surrogate marker for the ultrastructural demonstration of Birbeck granules, the absence of which represents a strong diagnostic criterion for ICT </plain></SENT>
