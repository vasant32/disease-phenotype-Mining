<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we describe an unusual histologic pattern of in situ <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> that was identified in a staging lymph node for <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colonic adenocarcinoma</z:mp> resected 4 years before a diagnosis of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Retrospective immunohistochemical studies showed scattered cyclin D1-expressing cells within otherwise reactive germinal centers but not in the surrounding mantle zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> cells limited to reactive germinal centers represents a novel "follicular in situ" growth pattern for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, which overlaps morphologically with reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and which could have implications for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
