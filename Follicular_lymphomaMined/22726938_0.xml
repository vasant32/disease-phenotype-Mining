<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1982 and 2007, 107 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone for low grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at Ann Arbor stage I (n = 50), II (n = 36) and III (n = 21); 48 and 59 patients were treated with EFI and TNI, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median total dose in the first treatment series of the diaphragmatic side with larger <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> burden was 38 Gy (25 Gy - 50 Gy) and after an interval of median 30 days, a total dose of 28 Gy (12.6 Gy - 45 Gy) was given in the second treatment series completing TNI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 14 years for living patients, 10-years and 15-years overall survival (OS) were 64% and 50%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival was not significantly different between stages I, II and III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TNI and EFI resulted in 15-years OS of 65% and 34% but patients treated with TNI were younger, had better performance status and higher stage of disease compared to patients treated with EFI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, only age at diagnosis (p &lt; 0.001, relative risk [RR] 1.06) and Karnofsky performance status (p = 0.04, RR = 0.96) were significantly correlated with OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Freedom from progression (FFP) was 58% and 56% after 10-years and 15-years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recurrences outside the irradiated volume were significantly reduced after TNI compared to EFI; however, increased rates of in-field recurrences and extra-nodal out-of-field recurrence counterbalanced this effect resulting in no significant difference in FFP between TNI and EFI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, FFP was significantly improved in stage I compared to stage II but no differences were observed between stages I/II and stage III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis no patient or treatment parameter was correlated with FFP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> toxicity was significantly increased after TNI compared to EFI with a trend to increased late toxicity as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy alone for stage I and II follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> resulted in long-term OS with high rates of disease control; no benefit of TNI over EFI was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For stage III follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, TNI achieved promising OS and FFP and should be considered as a potentially curative treatment option </plain></SENT>
