<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The human BCL-6 gene, which is rearranged in approximately 30% of diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, encodes a 706-amino-acid nuclear protein of the Kruppel-type zinc finger transcription factors mainly expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> germinal center B cells and related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four monoclonal antibodies (PG-B6, PG-B6a, PG-B6p, and PG-B6m), specifically directed against the human BCL-6 protein, were generated by immunizing BALB/c mice with a recombinant protein corresponding to the BCL-6 amino-terminal region (amino acids 3 to 484) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The PG-B6 monoclonal antibody reacted with a BCL-6 epitope sensitive to <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50913">fixatives</z:chebi> and preserved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mammalian species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PG-B6a (a is for avian) recognized the most evolutionarily conserved BCL-6 epitope (expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animal species including avian) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PG-B6p (p is for paraffin) recognized a <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50913">fixative</z:chebi>-resistant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> of BCL-6 that was detectable on paraffin sections after microwave heating in 1 mmol/L EDTA buffer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PG-B6m (m is for mantle) was the least specific monoclonal antibody as, in addition to BCL-6, it reacted with a yet undefined antigen selectively located in the cytoplasm of mantle and marginal zone B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> monoclonal antibodies detected strong nuclear expression of BCL-6 in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and nodular, lymphocyte-predominance <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, BCL-6 expression was independent of BCL-6 gene rearrangements and did not correlate with expression of other markers or the proliferation index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BCL-6 was not expressed in B-CLL, hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, mantle-cell- and marginal-zone-derived <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Labeling of paraffin sections with PG-B6p proved useful for differentiating proliferation centers in B-CLL (BCl-2+/BCL-6-) from trapped germinal centers in mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (BCL-2-/BCL-6+) and for identifying neoplastic cells in cases of nodular, lymphocyte-predominance <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because of their high specificity, wide reactivity in humans and animal species including avians (PG-B6a), and suitability for labeling routine paraffin sections (PG-B6p), the reagents described in this paper should prove valuable in both research and diagnostics </plain></SENT>
