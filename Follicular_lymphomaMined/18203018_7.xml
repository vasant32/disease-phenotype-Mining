<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored relationships between translocations status and clinical or histological parameters at diagnosis in 182 patients stratified in four groups: BCL2-/BCL6-, BCL2+/BCL6-, BCL2-/BCL6+ and BCL2+/BCL6+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BCL2-/BCL6- and BCL2+/BCL6- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Double negative cases were ascribed to lower histological grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, BCL2-/BCL6+ cases corresponded to higher grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, a majority of BCL2+/BCL6+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were classified as lower grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results were reinforced by the finding that double positive patients had lower LDH levels and PS than those with solitary BCL6 rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow involvement was more frequent in BCL2+/BCL6+ compared with BCL2-/BCL6+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data confirm the presence of a relationship between histological grade and translocation status, suggesting that FLs carrying BCL6 translocations probably constitute a special biological subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical and histological differences between BCL2-/BCL6+ and BCL2+/BCL6+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> could reflect an interplay between both translocations </plain></SENT>
