<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although immunologic studies have suggested the presence of some "activated" T cells in these B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, virtually no attention has been paid to the T-cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Wright-stained cytocentrifuged sheep erythrocyte (SRBC) rosette preparations from 20 cases of nodular follicular center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were therefore examined and the morphologic appearance of the SRBC rosetting cells was categorized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A mean of 19% (range 11-33%) of the SRBC-positive cells present were medium or large in size (diameter greater than two SRBCs, approximately 10 micron) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A mean of 62% of SRBC-positive cells had round nuclei; 18% had indented nuclei and 20% had irregularly shaped nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data provide supportive morphologic evidence for some T-cell "activation" in certain follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to having possible functional and biologic implications, the previously undescribed presence of enlarged and sometimes "atypical" T cells in uncomplicated follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> has implications for interpreting the histopathology of these B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and the reported occurrence of composite T-cell/follicular center-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
