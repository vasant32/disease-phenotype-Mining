<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histological findings and surface markers of cervical lymph node cells revealed no change from previous findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> cell involvement of bone marrow was also observed by molecular analysis of DNA fragments with bcl-2 oncogene and J-H gene probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following 2 courses of salvage chemotherapy with NOAC-M regimen (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50727">novantrone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>), There was an 88% reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> mass on computed tomographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Through the use of polymerase chain reaction analysis of residual cells with the bcl-2 translocation, we confirmed the in vivo purging of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells from bone marrow and we harvested marrow cells for autologous transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with ranimustine, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> followed by bone marrow transplantation (BMT), complete remission was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient has survived for 16 months and remains disease free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The standard chemotherapy regimen for advanced low grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has not yet been defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although we must follow this patient carefully to determine the effect of HDC with BMT for a long time, this seems to be an effective complementary treatment for patients responding to conventional salvage regimens </plain></SENT>
