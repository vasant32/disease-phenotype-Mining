<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> the majority of t(14;18) chromosome translocations occur at the 3' region of the bcl-2 gene and are juxtaposed to the J region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Direct involvement of the putative V-(D)-J recombinase in the translocation has been proposed, since the hot spot region of the breakpoints on chromosome 18 possesses the 7/9 signal-like sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 5' flanking region of bcl-2 gene is another hot spot of the translocations which are preferentially associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The translocation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> results in the juxtaposition of the bcl-2 gene to various regions on the immunoglobulin light chain loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No association of a 7/9 signal sequence and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the breakpoints within the bcl-2 and IgL loci suggest that the translocations occurring at the 5'-flanking region of the bcl-2 gene might be mediated by a different mechanism from that of the t(14;18) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that the breakpoints at the 5' flanking region of bcl-2 gene are surrounded by multiple alternating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi> elements (potential Z-DNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The antibodies specific to Z-DNA showed that the regions containing the alternating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi> elements were confined to the 5' hot spot region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that Z-DNA formation may be involved in chromosome translocations at the 5' flanking region of bcl-2 gene </plain></SENT>
