<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The variable nature of Ig expression in these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was evidenced by three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> biopsied from two different sites that showed an Ig-negative phenotype in one biopsy versus an Ig-positive phenotype in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The B lineage derivation of Ig-negative follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was confirmed by the presence of Ig heavy and light chain gene rearrangements in eight of eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a way similar to Ig-expressing follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the Ig-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were characterized by bcl-2 gene rearrangements (seven of eight) and overexpression of the Bcl-2 protein (eight out of nine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two of the three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with Ig-positive and Ig-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell populations, the clonal relationship of the Ig-expressing and nonexpressing cells was established by demonstration of identical t(14; 18) DNA rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The findings demonstrated that the variability of Ig expression in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> reflects the phenotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and is not a manifestation of separate clonal origins </plain></SENT>
