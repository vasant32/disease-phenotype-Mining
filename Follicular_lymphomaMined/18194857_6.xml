<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Radiolabelled immunotherapy is a significant step forward in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), with preliminary data suggesting long remissions in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan is the only therapy approved for use after rituximab failure and is currently indicated in the EU for the treatment of adults with rituximab-relapsed or refractory CD20-positive follicular B-cell NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, retrospective analyses confirm better responses when 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan is used earlier in the disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An expert panel of oncologists, haematologists and nuclear medicine physicians met at an European workshop to discuss proposed therapeutic algorithms for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the preliminary medical evidence supporting the incorporation of 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan as an early therapeutic option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phase II data indicate that 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan either alone as primary therapy or as consolidation therapy following induction chemotherapy with or without rituximab achieves high response rates in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, with complete remission rates of 62-80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phase III data are warranted, but based on preliminary observations the expert panel recommended incorporation of radiolabelled immunotherapy into national <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treatment algorithms across Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This approach would maximise the therapeutic potential of this agent by encouraging its use early in the disease course of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
