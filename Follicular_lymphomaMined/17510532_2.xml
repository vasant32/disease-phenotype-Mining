<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed single cell polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the t (14 ; 18) translocation from paraffin embedded sections in a case of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) with subsequent development of Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells of FL were positive for CD20, CD10 and BCL-2, and negative for CD3, CD30 and CD15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> were positive for CD20, CD30 and CD15, and negative for CD3 and CD10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EBER-1 RNA in situ hybridization failed to stain with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HRS cells manipulated and FL cells micro-shaved from individual neoplastic follicles were subjected to single-cell PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The t (14 ; 18) translocation, a chimeric DNA containing portions of the bcl-2 and the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) genes, was amplified from four of 27 isolated HRS cells and two individual FL follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> t (14 ; 18) PCRs yielded products of the same size, and an identical nucleotide sequence including the t (14 ; 18) translocation was found in both FL and HRS samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the data demonstrate the common clonal origin of FL cells and HRS cells in subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>, and that both FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> were derived from germinal center B cells with the t (14 ; 18) translocation </plain></SENT>
