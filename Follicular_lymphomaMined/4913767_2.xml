<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During a 9-year period (1958-66) 260 histologically verified cases of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the different histological types was as follows: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> 50.9%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079734" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphosarcoma</z:e> 33%, reticulum cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> 14.2%, giant follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 1.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt's tumour</z:e> were encountered.This study indicates that malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is not uncommon in Jamaica, and that its distribution pattern is similar to that observed in Europe and North America, except for the paucity of giant follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and is different from the pattern observed in parts of Africa populated by Negroes, where <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt's tumour</z:e> is the most common type, and where <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> is relatively uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The age and sex incidence was in general similar to other reported series, but the duration of symptoms was short </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients presented with generalised peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>Hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> were common on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prognosis was generally poor in comparison with European and North American series due to advanced stage of disease on presentation </plain></SENT>
