<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The distinction between benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> (FH) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is sometimes problematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We wanted to determine whether the expression of bcl-2 of FH was quantitatively different from that of FL, using surface CD20 expression as a discriminator of the various lymphoid compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lymph node cell suspensions from 12 cases of FH and 17 cases of FL were analyzed by flow cytometry using a combined surface CD20 and intracellular bcl-2 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD20- T cells in FH demonstrated the same bcl-2 expression as the CD20+ mantle cells, but the bright CD20+ germinal center cells showed near absence of bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the neoplastic cells of FL showed greater bcl-2 expression than the T cells of the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell populations of FH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This difference was particularly significant between the neoplastic B cells of FL and the germinal center cells of FH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combined analysis of CD20 and bcl-2 should be useful for the differential diagnosis between FH and FL and particularly applicable to limited samples or when B-cell clonality is in question </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whether the quantitation of bcl-2 expression can be of further discriminatory value in malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
