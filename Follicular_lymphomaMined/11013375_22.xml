<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The pathology files of a regional hospital in southern Taiwan for 1989-1998 were searched for malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (EBER) were correlated with clinical findings, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases were classified according to REAL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 205 cases were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 197 cases (96.1%) of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and 8 cases (3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>9%) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 197 NHL cases, 161 (81.7%) were of B-cell lineage and 36 (18.3%) were of T-/natural killer cell lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were the most common B-cell subtypes and represented 47.2%, 19.3%, and 6.1%, respectively, of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 36 cases of T-/natural killer cell lineage, unspecified peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (8.6%), T-/natural killer cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (angiocentric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) (4.1%), and anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (3.6%) were the most common subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven of eight T-/natural killer cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases were positive for EBER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The eight cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> were classified as lymphocyte-rich classic (two cases), nodular <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (two cases), and mixed cellularity (four cases) subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three of these eight cases were positive for EBER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge this study is the first in Taiwan using the REAL classification and it again confirms the different geographic distribution of the various subtypes of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The frequency of T-/natural killer cell lineage NHL in Taiwan is higher than that in Western countries but not as high as reported previously </plain></SENT>
