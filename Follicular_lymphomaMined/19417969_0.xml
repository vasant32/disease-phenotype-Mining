<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For this retrospective analysis, material was available in 385 out of 519 cases diagnosed as ML from 1988-2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Morphological assessment was followed by immunohistochemistry using a panel of antibodies </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Male preponderance (male to female ratio 1.6:1) and a wide age range was observed (6 months to 103 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were the most common NHL seen (81.6%) and diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) was the most frequent type of NHL encountered (50.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> like follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) and small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>) were rather uncommon (13.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> comprised 18.3% of the NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> was nodular <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> classical Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NSCHL) (68.3%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Unlike other parts of KSA and Middle East, NSCHL is the most common type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> encountered </plain></SENT>
