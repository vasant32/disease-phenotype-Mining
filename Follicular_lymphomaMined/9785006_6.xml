<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly large products of approximately 1 kilobase (kb) were detected by gel electrophoresis in 2 of 50 positive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these 2 cases, sequence analyses showed novel breakpoints in the 3' untranslated region of bcl-2, approximately 800 bp downstream of the major breakpoint region (mbr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The breakpoints in IgH occurred in JH4 in one patient and JH5 in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequences just upstream of the new bcl-2 breakpoints suggest a mechanism of translocation that may include minisatellite core-mediated recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one of our two patients with novel bcl-2 breakpoints, the approximately 1 kb product obtained using conventional mbr primers was detectable only when a nested PCR was performed </plain></SENT>
