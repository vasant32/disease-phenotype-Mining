<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From 1995 to 2000, 16 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> underwent allogeneic BMT at our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the time of transplantation, two patients were in complete remission, 11 in partial remission and three had refractory disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients were transplanted using a standard myeloablative conditioning regimen and two a nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 1184 days (range 403-1999 days) after BMT, 11 patients were alive, whereas five died of transplant-related mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight patients remained in CR 284+ to 1022+ days (median 560+ days) after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients relapsed 63 and 1073 days after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They achieved a further complete remission after salvage treatment and remained alive 403 and 1224 days after BMT, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient with autologous reconstitution had never been in CR after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>He was retreated with salvage chemotherapy but only achieved CR with subsequent rituximab treatment and was still alive, 1999 days after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The estimated 2-year overall survival and event-free survival rates were 68% and 55%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Age greater than 37 years at diagnosis, positive recipient CMV serology and ECOG performance status &gt; or =1 at diagnosis were associated with shorter overall survival (P = 0.05, P = 0.009 and P = 0.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ann Arbor III-IV stage at diagnosis was associated with shorter event-free survival (P &lt; 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic BMT seems to be effective for patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, the relatively high rate of early transplant-related mortality emphasizes the need to define indications and use prospective protocols involving a less toxic transplant procedure </plain></SENT>
