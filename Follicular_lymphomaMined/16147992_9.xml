<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BCL6 is a transcriptional repressor required for germinal center formation, and the gene encoding it is frequently altered in diffuse large B-cell and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dysregulation of BCL6 has therefore been implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A limited number of proteins is known to interact with BCL6 and modulate its activity or participate in its role in transcriptional regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Identification of additional BCL6-binding proteins could reveal potential signaling targets and previously undescribed functional roles for BCL6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used a functional proteomic approach to determine the identity of proteins that interact with BCL6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proteins were isolated by co-immunoprecipitation with an anti-BCL6 antibody and identified using MS/MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We identified 61 proteins in the BCL6 immunocomplex from the following Gene Ontology categories: transcription regulator activity (n = 18), binding activity (n = 11), signal transducer activity (n = 10), catalytic activity (n = 8), structural molecule activity (n = 3), enzyme regulator activity (n = 3), transporter activity (n = 2), motor activity (n = 2), chaperone activity (n = 1), and unknown function (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly we identified BCL6 and several previously reported BCL6-interacting proteins in the BCL6 immunocomplex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The remaining proteins have not been shown previously to be associated with BCL6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MS/MS results were validated on four proteins using immunoprecipitation and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two of these protein interactions were further confirmed by reciprocal immunoprecipitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates the utility of antibody immunoprecipitation and subsequent <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> identification by MS/MS for the elucidation of BCL6-binding proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Many of the novel proteins identified in this study suggest additional functional roles for BCL6 beyond transcriptional repression </plain></SENT>
