<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Substantial evidence supports the hypothesis that the t(14;18) and Bcl-2 overexpression are necessary but not solely responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> and require cooperating genetic derangements for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> to occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate genes that cooperate with Bcl-2 to influence cellular signaling pathways important for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e>, we used oligonucleotide microarrays to determine differential gene expression patterns in CD19+ B cells isolated from Emu-Bcl-2 transgenic mice and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermate control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven genes were induced and 94 genes were repressed by &gt; or =2-fold in Emu-Bcl-2 transgenic mice (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) gene was found to be overexpressed 5-fold in B cells from Emu-Bcl-2 transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of Bcl-2 in both mouse embryo fibroblast-1 and hematopoietic cell lines resulted in induction of SOCS3 protein, suggesting a Bcl-2-associated mechanism underlying SOCS3 induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry with SOCS3 antisera on tissue from a cohort of patients with de novo follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> revealed marked overexpression of SOCS3 protein that, within the follicular center cell region, was limited to neoplastic follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and colocalized with Bcl-2 expression in 9 of 12 de novo follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, SOCS3 protein expression was not detected in the follicular center cell region of benign hyperplastic tonsil tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that Bcl-2 overexpression leads to the induction of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and to the induction of SOCS3, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
