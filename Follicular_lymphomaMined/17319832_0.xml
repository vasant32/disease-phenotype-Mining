<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cold hemagglutinins are generally immunoglobulin M (IgM) kappa antibodies reactive at temperatures below 37 degrees C and if of high titer may cause <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Platelet (PLT) cold agglutinins (CAs) are rare and poorly characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A detailed molecular characterization of the variable domains of a pathologic, PLT-reactive, CA is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 70-year-old woman was admitted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> accompanied by widespread <z:hpo ids='HP_0000967'>petechiae</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>bruising</z:mp>, tongue and buccal mucosa <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and epistaxes and proved refractory to HLA- and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>-matched PLTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Detailed investigation showed monoclonal heavy-chain gene rearrangement with an IgM paraprotein of 3.3 g per L and a trace of kappa Bence Jones protein in the urine, compatible with a diagnosis of secretory B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B-NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PLT antibody (PAIg) investigations revealed a potent IgM kappa PLT CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of the rearranged variable domain genes of the malignant clone together with idiotype-specific antibodies obtained by DNA-based immunization of rabbits and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight analysis of the PAIgM provided a irrefutable link between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, the IgM paraprotein, and the PAIgM against alphaIIbbeta3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> were refractory to standard treatment and PLT transfusion, but treatment with rituximab resulted in a recovery of the PLT count and a complete remission of B-NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The IgM kappa paraprotein derived from the malignant B-cell clone was a potent and clinically significant CA against alphaIIbbeta3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The testing for PLT CAs in patients with a paraprotein and refractory to matched PLTs may aid the selection of appropriate treatment </plain></SENT>
