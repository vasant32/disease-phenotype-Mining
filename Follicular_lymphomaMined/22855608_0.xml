<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unlike conventional adult FL, PFL typically does not recur or progress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clear diagnostic criteria for PFL are lacking, and it is uncertain whether this indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is defined by age or may occur in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 27 FL in patients &lt; 40 years of age and found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 21 cases that lacked a BCL2 gene abnormality (BCL2-N; P &lt; .0001) and had &gt; 30% Ki67 fraction (high proliferation index, HPI; P = .0007) were stage I and did not progress or recur; in comparison, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 cases with BCL2 rearrangement and/or PI &lt; 30% were stage III/IV, and 5 of 6 recurred or progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a separate cohort of 58 adult FL (â‰¥ 18 years of age), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 13 BCL2-N/HPI cases were stage I, and none progressed or relapsed, whereas 11 of 15 stage I cases with BCL2 gene abnormality and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LPI</z:e> relapsed or progressed (P = .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The adult and pediatric BCL2-N/HPI FL cases had similar morphologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm the highly indolent behavior of PFL and suggest that these are characterized by HPI and absence of BCL2 gene abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PFL-like cases also occur in adults and are associated with indolent behavior in this patient population </plain></SENT>
