<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Filtering the genome for overexpressed genes coding for cell membrane-bound proteins/receptors resulted in a hit list of 27 identified genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among these, we have focused on the aberrant over expression of CX3CR1, in different types of B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, as compared to non-malignant B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that CX3CR1, which normally is not expressed on B cells, is expressed both at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein level in several subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CX3CR1 has also shown to be involved in the homing to specific tissues that express the ligand, CX3CL1, in breast and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> and may thus be involved in dissemination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
