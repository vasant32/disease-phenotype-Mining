<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were classified according to the Rappaport and Kiel systems and the Working Formulation (WF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A low incidence of nodular/follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (12%) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common histologic subtypes were diffuse histiocytic, diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e>, and diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, according to Rappaport, Kiel, and the WF, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A high proportion (24%) of the cases were unclassifiable, according to Kiel, because of the precise terms of the classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The "favorable"-prognosis NHL, according to Rappaport, or the low-grade NHL, according to Kiel and the WF, had a more indolent clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, except for the nodular mixed (Rappaport) or follicular mixed (WF) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> which appeared to behave like the more aggressive NHL, a plateau was not seen in the survival curves of our patients with other kinds of favorable-prognosis or low-grade NHL, indicating the lack of curative potential of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lymphoplasmacytoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, according to Kiel, also appeared to have a more aggressive clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A plateau was seen in most of the other survival curves of patients with the more aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, indicating the prospect of cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the prognosis of the very aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> such as the diffuse lymphoblastic and diffuse small noncleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, according to the WF, remains very poor with a median survival of less than 10 months </plain></SENT>
