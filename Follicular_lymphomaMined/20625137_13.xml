<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicenter trial evaluated two or three weekly infusions of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">yttrium</z:chebi>-90 ((90)Y) epratuzumab tetraxetan (humanized anti-CD22 antibody) in 64 patients with relapsed/refractory NHL, including 17 patients who underwent prior autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Objective (OR) and complete responses (CR/complete response unconfirmed [CRu]), as well as progression-free survival (PFS), were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the maximum total (90)Y dose of 45 mCi/m(2) (1,665 MBq/m(2)), grade 3 to 4 hematologic toxicities were reversible to grade 1 in patients with less than 25% bone marrow involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall OR rate and median PFS for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 61 evaluable patients was 62% (CR/CRu, 48%) and 9.5 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients without prior ASCT obtained high OR rates of 71% (CR/CRu, 55%) across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL subtypes and (90)Y doses, even in poor-risk categories (refractory to last anti-CD20-containing regimen, 73% [CR/CRu, 60%]; bulky disease: 71% [CR/CRu, 43%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with prior ASCT received lower doses, but achieved an OR rate of 41% (CR/CRu, 29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), OR rates and median PFS increased with total (90)Y-dose, reaching 100% (CR/CRu, 92%) and 24.6 months, respectively, at the highest dose levels (&gt; 30 mCi/m(2) total (90)Y-dose [1,110 MBq/m(2)]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, patients with FL refractory to prior anti-CD20-containing regimens achieved 90% (nine of 10 patients) OR and CR/CRu rates and a median PFS of 21.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Fractionated anti-CD22 radioimmunotherapy provides high total doses of (90)Y, yielding high rates of durable CR/CRus in relapsed/refractory NHL, resulting in 20 mCi/m(2) x 2 weeks as the recommended dose for future studies </plain></SENT>
