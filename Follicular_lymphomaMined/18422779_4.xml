<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLC numbers were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the t(14;18)-translocation or by allele-specific PCR for rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analysed blood samples from 43 patients treated in a randomized trial comparing eight cycles of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> versus R-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clearance of CLC at the end of therapy was achieved in 21/25 patients (84%) treated with R-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> compared with 0/18 after <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> alone (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A &gt; or = 2 log CLC reduction was associated with a favourable clinical response (P = 0.0004) and prolonged event-free survival (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In R-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> patients, stable CLC numbers or consistently PCR-negative blood samples were associated with a continuing clinical remission whereas in two patients a relapse was preceded by a &gt; or = 2 log CLC increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated that R-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> led to a rapid and sustained eradication of CLC and a &gt; or = 2 log CLC reduction was associated with a superior quality and duration of the clinical response </plain></SENT>
