<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In contrast to highly mutated follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myelomas</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo> (CLLs) frequently express VH genes in germline configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is currently unclear whether this difference is related to the expression of CD5 or to the differentiation stage of the B cell when <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied the VH sequence of 11 cases of CD5- B-CLL to address the question whether CD5- B-CLL are derived from naive pregerminal B cells (low mutation pattern) or from germinal center-derived memory B cells (high mutation pattern) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 12 detected rearrangements (2 distinct rearrangements in 1 case) VH1 family was found in 2, VH2 in 2, VH3 in 4, and VH4 in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine different VH genes were detected among the 12 rearrangements, including 2 cases expressing V1-69 (51p1) and 1 case expressing V4-39 (VH4.18), previously reported to be overexpressed in CD5+ B-CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A higher mutation pattern, following a random distribution, was observed when compared with classical CD5+ B-CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, as reported in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells, these results appeared to be related to membrane Ig phenotype (less mutations in membrane mu delta-expressing forms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> expressing exclusively membrane mu) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, the differences found when comparing the mutational profile with classical CD5+ B-CLL were not clearcut and might be explained more by the membrane isotype (mu v mu delta) than by CD5 expression </plain></SENT>
