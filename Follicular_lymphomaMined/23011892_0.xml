<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a relative high rate of false-positive results has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a case of a 40-year-old man with a previous history of a nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IVA</z:e>, treated with R-CHOP, which showed strong (18)F-FDG uptake in the Waldeyer's tonsillar ring during his follow-up, being considered highly suspicious of relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A surgical removal of the palatine tonsils and adenoids was performed, which showed reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, bone marrow biopsy revealed absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient is still in follow-up with no signs of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case illustrates that, despite the high sensitivity for the detection of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, (18)F-FDG uptake should be interpreted with great caution and confirmatory studies should be performed before any therapy </plain></SENT>
