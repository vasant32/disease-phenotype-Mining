<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymph nodes, BCL-2 protein was most abundant in the small lymphocytes of primary lymphoid follicles and the mantle zones of secondary follicles, virtually absent within germinal centers, and of variable abundance in many interfollicular cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the distribution of BCL-2 mRNA was roughly reciprocal to that of the protein with intense hybridization signal in germinal centers and almost none in mantle zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Discordant BCL-2 RNA and protein levels were also observed in tonsillar epithelial cells and cortical thymocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concordant and abundant expression of BCL-2 mRNA and protein was detected in biopsy tissues and cell lines from t(14;18)-carrying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The contrasting distributions of BCL-2 protein and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid tissues suggest that translational and posttranslational control mechanisms play a significant role in regulating BCL-2 protein levels in germinal center cells, epithelial cells, and cortical thymocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concordant BCL-2 mRNA and protein levels in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> suggest that translational control mechanisms may be disrupted as part of the sequence of genetic changes that transforms <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid cells into neoplastic follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
