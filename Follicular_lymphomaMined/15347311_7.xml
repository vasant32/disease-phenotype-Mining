<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The anti-CD20 antibody rituximab has been employed successfully for the same indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No such data were available on a combined use of these agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we conducted a phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a combination of rituximab (375 mg/m2), fludarabine (4 x 25 mg/m2) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (1 x 750 mg/m2), for the treatment of relapsed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An unexpected, severe hematologic toxicity with significant, prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenias</z:hpo> WHO grade III/IV in 6 (35%) of 17 patients treated in total occurred, leading to early termination of the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytologic and serologic analyses point toward a direct toxic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Older patients (mean age 64.7 vs. 56.5 yr) were significantly (P = 0.02) more likely to suffer from this toxicity, whereas no other clinical or hematologic parameter differed statistically between the patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The addition of rituximab to fludarabine/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> employed at doses given above in relapsed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> may have led to this increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, caution should be exercised when combining these drugs for the treatment of patients with relapsed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, especially when treating older patients </plain></SENT>
