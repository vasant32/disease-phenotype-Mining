<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective is to compare the efficacy of the less common, but more easily implemented modality, CT, with that of FDG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients diagnosed with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in our hospital between October 2002 and March 2006, and compared the efficacy of FDG-PET and CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The standard reference was defined by the pathology and clinical course of patients followed for more than 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-three cases for staging and 62 cases for response evaluation after treatment were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of each modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of the diagnostic modality was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of the initial staging were 87% and 100% on CT evaluation and 87% and 100% on FDG-PET, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity of the re-staging were 81% and 78% on CT evaluation and 82% and 97% on FDG-PET, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic accuracy of FDG-PET was comparable with that of CT both in initial staging and response evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The maximum standardized uptake value was not associated with patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In subgroup analysis, a tendency of lower sensitivity in the initial staging was found in FDG-PET for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and CT for diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although different staging procedures appear better suited to certain subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, in general CT imaging might be as useful as FDG-PET in initial staging in selected patients </plain></SENT>
