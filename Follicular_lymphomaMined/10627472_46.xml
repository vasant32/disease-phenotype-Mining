<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The chemokine receptor CXCR3 has been previously shown to be widely expressed on activated T cells and to mediate T-cell chemotaxis on binding to various ligands, including Mig, IP-10, and ITAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using immunohistochemical and flow cytometric analysis, we report that CXCR3 is also expressed on a subset of peripheral blood B cells and in distinct subtypes of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CXCR3 immunohistochemical or flow cytometric expression was seen in 37 of 39 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (diffusely positive in 33 cases), whereas mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (30 cases), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (27 cases), and small noncleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (8 cases) were negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Strong CXCR3 expression was also seen in splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (14 of 14 cases) and in the monocytoid and plasmacytic cells in extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (15 of 16 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This differential expression of CXCR3 in B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> contrasts with that of another B-cell-associated chemokine receptor, BLR1/CXCR5, which we show here is expressed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also report that the CXCR3 ligand, Mig, is coexpressed on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in many cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e> (10 of 13 cases examined) with Mig expression less frequently seen in other B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Coexpression of CXCR3 and its ligand, Mig, may be an important functional interaction in B-CLL, as well as a useful diagnostic marker for the differential diagnosis of small cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
