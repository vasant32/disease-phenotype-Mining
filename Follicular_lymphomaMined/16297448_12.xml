<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study assessed prevalence, frequency, age and gender distribution and breakpoint locations, and detection method validity for the bcl-2/IgH rearrangement in 204 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, both classic two-step, nested, semi-quantitative PCR as well as a newly established sequence-specific, hybridization probe-based real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) were employed and tested for their sensitivity and specificity for detecting t(14;18) positive cells in healthy blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, almost a quarter (24%; 39/204) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> healthy individuals carried the translocation, confirming data of one large prior report [Summers KE, Goff LK, Wilson AG, Gupta RK, Lister TA, Fitzgibbon J </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Frequency of the Bcl-2/IgH rearrangement in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals: implications for the monitoring of disease in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>J Clin Oncol 2001;19(2):420-4] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regarding presence as well as frequency of the translocation, no correlation to age (mean frequency 2.0:10(4), with a median of &lt;l:10(4), for &lt;40 years, and mean frequency 1.9:10(4), with a median of &lt;l:10(4) for individuals&gt;or=40 years) nor gender was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparing the two PCR approaches, a 95.1% concordance (194/204) regarding t(14;18) detection was determined for nested and RQ-PCR, with nested PCR being slightly more sensitive (reproducible detection limit l:10(5) cells versus 1:10(4); maximum detection limit l:10(6) versus 1:10(5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis confirmed individual breakpoints for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples analyzed (29/29), indicating detection validity for both PCR approaches and ruling out contamination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint location distribution pattern appeared to be comparable to the pattern seen with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) patient collectives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, clonal bcl-2/IgH rearrangements are indeed a very frequent observation in healthy individuals, and appear to be independent of age and gender in regard to presence and frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This represents a conflicting finding in context of potential biological significance, and presents a potential disruptive factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) monitoring in FL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prospective future trials will have to clarify the biological significance of this important observation </plain></SENT>
