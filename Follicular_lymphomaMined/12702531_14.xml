<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated serum rituximab levels in 26 patients with follicular or mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated with a combination of ASCT and immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received nine infusions of rituximab (375 mg/m(2)): one dose as an 'in vivo purge' prior to stem cell collection, and two 4-week cycles at 8 and 24 weeks following ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre- and post-infusion serum rituximab levels were measured during the purging dose, with doses 1 and 4 of both sets of maintenance rituximab cycles, and 12 weeks and 24 weeks following treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rituximab levels were detectable after the first infusion, and peaked at a mean concentration of 463.8 micro g/ml after the final dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels remained detectable 24 weeks after completion of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward higher rituximab levels in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations achieved during the maintenance cycles were similar to levels observed in patients with measurable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated during 'the pivotal trial' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlation was observed between serum rituximab levels achieved in the minimal disease state and the risk of later clinical relapse, nor with the ability to achieve a molecular remission following ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The finding that patients treated in minimal <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> and at the time of active disease both achieve similar final serum rituximab concentrations after four infusions suggests that the pharmacokinetics are complex, and may not necessarily correlate with disease burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The precise factors influencing rituximab clearance in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are unresolved, and this remains an area of active research </plain></SENT>
