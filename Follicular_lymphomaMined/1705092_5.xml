<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The My4 antibody, one of a number of monoclonal antibodies that react with the CD14 antigen, was originally reported to weakly stain monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recent studies have shown that the My4 antibody also stains <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood B lymphocytes and some subtypes of B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the authors have studied a large series of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> stained with the My4 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In frozen sections of reactive lymph node biopsy specimens, the My4 antibody strongly stained mantle zone B lymphocytes and weakly reacted with dendritic reticulum cells and histiocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a series of 245 non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the My4 antibody stained 111 (45%) cases: 108 of 189 (57%) B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 3 of 50 (6%) T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and 0 of 6 null cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>My4-positive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> histologic subtypes with the exception of small noncleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were most often My4 positive (82%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>My4 antibody staining showed no correlation with Working Formulation grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three My4-positive T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had a mature T-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six of the 111 (68%) My4-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were also analyzed with at least one other anti-CD14 antibody, either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37238">Mo2</z:chebi> and/or Leu-M3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases the antigens that react with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37238">Mo2</z:chebi> and Leu-M3 were not expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, the staining of reactive and neoplastic B cells by My4 appears to be unique to this antibody and is not a feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> anti-CD14 antibodies </plain></SENT>
