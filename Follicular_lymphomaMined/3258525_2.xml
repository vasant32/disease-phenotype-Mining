<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the occurrence, immunohistochemical profile, ultrastructural features and relationships to lymphocytes of the non-lymphoid accessory cells in the dermal infiltrate of five patients affected by B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with secondary involvement of the skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Typical non-lymphoid accessory cells were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of these cells had ultrastructural features which resembled those of the poorly differentiated dendritic reticulum cells described in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemical findings of DRC-I+, C3b r+ dendritic cells often arranged in follicular-like structures with neoplastic B cells and only few, scattered OKMI+, OKM5+ mononuclear phagocytes support the hypothesis that the vast majority of the non-lymphoid cells observed in our cases were poorly differentiated dendritic reticulum cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results and previously published reports indicate that the organization of the dermal infiltrate of B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> tends to reproduce the typical arrangement of the B zone of the lymphoid tissue, although with a lesser degree of differentiation, similar to that observed in lymph node follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
