<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred twenty patients with FL treated in our institution between 1975 and 1990, with a median follow-up duration of 9 years, were included in this retrospective analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transformation was proven by histology in 34 patients or by cytology in 13 patients and was considered as highly probable on clinical arguments in five patients for an overall incidence of 24% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The probability of transformation was 22% at 5 years and 31% at 10 years and tended to plateau after 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Predictive factors for transformation were nonachievement of complete remission (CR) after initial therapy (P &lt; 10(-4), low serum albumin level (&lt; 35 g/L) (P = .001), and beta 2-microglobulin level greater than 3 mg/L (P = .02) at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a multiparametric analysis, only beta 2-microglobulin level retained prognostic significance for freedom-from-transformation (FFT) survival (P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transformation accounted for 44% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and was associated with a poor outcome, with a median survival time of 7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transformation is an early event in the course of the disease and is mainly observed in patients with known adverse prognostic factors or those who do not achieve CR after initial treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings may be useful to select follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients for intensive therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
