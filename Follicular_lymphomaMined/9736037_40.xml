<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The CDKN2A gene located on chromosome region 9p21 encodes the cyclin-dependent kinase-4 inhibitor p16/INK4A, a negative cell cycle regulator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed p16/INK4A expression in different types of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to determine whether the absence of this protein is involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e>, while also trying to characterize the genetic events underlying this p16/INK4A loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To this end, we investigated the levels of p16/INK4A protein using immunohistochemical techniques in 153 cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, using as reference the levels found in reactive lymphoid tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The existence of gene mutation, CpG island methylation, and allelic loss were investigated in a subset of 26 cases, using single-strand conformational polymorphism and direct sequencing, Southern Blot, polymerase chain reaction, and microsatellite analysis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Loss of p16/INK4A expression was detected in 41 of the 112 non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> studied (37%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which corresponded to high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This loss of p16/INK4A was found more frequently in cases showing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (31 of 37) or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (4 of 4) into diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the status of the p16/INK4A gene showed different genetic alterations (methylation of the 5'-CpG island of the p16/INK4A gene, 6 of 23 cases; allelic loss at 9p21, 3 of 16 cases; and nonsense mutation, 1 of 26 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, these events were associated with loss of the p16/INK4A protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No case that preserved protein expression contained any genetic change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that p16/INK4A loss of expression contributes to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most frequent genetic alterations found were 5'-CpG island methylation and allelic loss </plain></SENT>
