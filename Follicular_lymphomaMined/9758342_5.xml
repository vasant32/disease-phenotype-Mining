<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The marrow mononuclear cell fraction was treated in vitro with four anti-B cell antibodies and baby rabbit complement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether in vitro treatment of the marrow could remove morphologically undetectable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PCR analysis for the t(14;18) was used to determine the presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the time of the bone marrow harvest, 21/25 bone marrow samples were positive for the t(14;18), in 15/22 patients, the rearrangement could also be demonstrated in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After in vitro treatment, 18/21 samples (86%) remained 'PCR positive' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the t(14;18) PCR products was performed on the latter and on lymph node biopsy material taken at diagnosis from 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The same t(14;18) sequences were found in the bone marrow harvest samples as in the patients' original biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that this form of in vitro treatment does not completely eradicate the t(14;18) bearing clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>New and better methods need to be developed </plain></SENT>
