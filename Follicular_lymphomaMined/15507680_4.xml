<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), it is unresolved whether peripheral blood (PB) can replace bone marrow (BM) aspirate samples for detection of bcl-2/JH fusion sequences that result from the t(14;18)(q32;q21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compare here the results of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) analysis for bcl-2/JH involving the major breakpoint cluster region (mbr) on paired PB and BM aspirate samples from 60 consecutive FL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between the level of bcl-2/JH fusion sequence obtained from PB and BM aspirate samples (r = 0.886), with 82% of samples showing less than one log of difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who had histological evidence of FL involving concurrent BM biopsy specimens had moderate to high levels of bcl-2/JH in both PB and BM aspirate samples, allowing unequivocal determination of translocation status (median bcl-2/JH to cyclophilin level was 8.014%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients with no detectable FL in their BM biopsy specimens often showed low levels of bcl-2/JH in both PB and BM aspirate samples (bcl-2/JH to cyclophilin median level = 0.006%), in a range similar to background levels that could be detected in patients without FL (n = 15, median bcl-2 mbr/JH to cyclophilin level = 0.002%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that PB can be used in place of BM aspirate samples to test for the presence of bcl-2 mbr/JH fusion sequence in FL patients and that either PB or BM aspirate testing yields a rough approximation of the degree of BM involvement by FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in patients with minimal levels of bcl-2/JH in PB or BM aspirate samples, confirmation of this result by testing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> is recommended to confirm the presence of an identical bcl-2/JH fusion sequence and exclude false-positive results </plain></SENT>
