<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE: A 65-year-old woman visited our clinic for treatment of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009761" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">conjunctival tumor</z:e> in the left eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Incisional biopsy revealed that the lesion was a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with well-defined follicles, and it was L 26(CD20) and BCL-2 positive immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis showed that more than 70% of the cells were double positive for CD10 and CD20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Southern blot hybridization demonstrated gene rearrangement bands in the immunoglobulin gene JH region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The chromosome had a translocation t(14, 18) (q32, q21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Systemic evaluation detected no other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The lesion was a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> derived from conjunctival tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional examinations such as flow cytometric analysis, gene analysis, and chromosome examination were useful for differential diagnosis of marginal zone B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue type and benign reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
