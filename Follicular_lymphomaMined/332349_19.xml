<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histologic classification included nodular poorly differentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (54 patients), nodular mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (21 patients), and diffuse poorly differentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (24 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High overall response rates were seen with either approach (90% for radiotherpy; 86% for chemotherapy) and complete remission were relatively common (60%--80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall median survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in this trial will exceed 5 years regardless of the induction therapy used; however, disease-free survival is not commonly achieved with either regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relapse-free survival rates at 4-year followup, regardless of induction regimen, are 13% for diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 24% for nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second prospective trial attempts to use a combined approach and compares cyclic combination chemotherapy with total-body irradiation and combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Initial results on 34 patients indicate high overall response rates (100%) and similar complete remission rates (64%--67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With 14 months' median followup no patients in either arm of the trial have died but relatively equal numbers have relapsed </plain></SENT>
