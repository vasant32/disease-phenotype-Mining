<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have employed multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) to characterize the cytogenetic changes in 20 diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), that contained complex and partially characterized karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The M-FISH analysis helped to delineate 94% of the unidentified abnormalities and assisted in redefining some unidentified/misidentified karyotypic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recurrent breakpoints observed in approximately 20% cases included 14q32, 3p21, 3q27, 22q12, 1q25, and 18q21 (in decreasing order), and 1p22, 1q21, 4q31, 6q21, and 8q24 (in four cases each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Numerical gain of chromosomes 7, 9, 12, and X and loss of chromosomes 1, 4, 6, 17, and Y, were noted in approximately 20% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The minimum deleted regions encompassed 6q21-q25, 1p22-p36, 1q32-q44, 2p23-p25, 4q31-q35, 13p13-q14, and 17p11-p13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two cases presented with a sole structural abnormality, and one contained a der(17)t(9;17)(p21;p13), which has not been reported earlier as a sole abnormality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Upon completely characterizing the karyotypes, we observed with interesting that in 55% of the cases, more than one BCL gene bearing regions was involved in translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 45%, where only one or none of the BCL gene regions was involved in a rearrangement, we observed the loss of chromosomes 6 and/or 17 or partial deletions of 6q and/or 17p or gain of 7 and/or 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that, although BCL2 and BCL6 are most often implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, the possibility of the disruptions of BCL3, BCL8, BCL9, and BCL10 as a "primary event" in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> cannot be ruled out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most often, a combination of events may be necessary for the genesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> or progression of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, M-FISH has enhanced our ability to provide a comprehensive karyotypic analysis, and has helped in defining the importance of BCL3, BCL8, BCL9, and BCL10 carrying breakpoints in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
