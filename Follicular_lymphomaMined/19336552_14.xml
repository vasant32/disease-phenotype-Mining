<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal translocations are the hallmark genetic aberration in non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), with specific translocations often selectively associated with specific NHL subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because many NHL-associated translocations involve cell cycle, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and lymphocyte development regulatory genes, we evaluated NHL risk associated with common genetic variation in 20 candidate genes in these pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of 203 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) was conducted in 1,946 NHL cases and 1,808 controls pooled from 3 independent population-based case-control studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used logistic regression to compute odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for NHL and four major NHL subtypes in relation to tag SNP genotypes and haplotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed the most striking associations for tag SNPs in the proapoptotic gene BCL2L11 (BIM) and BCL7A, which is involved in a rare NHL-associated translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Variants in BCL2L11 were strongly related to follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> only, particularly rs3789068 (OR(AG), 1.41; 95% CI, 1.10-1.81; OR(GG), 1.65; 95% CI, 1.25-2.19; P(trend) = 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Variants in BCL7A were strongly related to diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> only, particularly rs1880030 (OR(AG), 1.34; 95% CI, 1.08-1.68; OR(AA), 1.60; 95% CI, 1.22-2.08; P(trend) = 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The associations for both variants were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three studies and supported by haplotype analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also observed notable associations for variants in BCL6, CCND1, and MYC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results support the role of common genetic variation in cell cycle, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and lymphocyte development regulatory genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e>, and suggest that effects may vary by NHL subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Replication of our findings and further study to identify functional SNPs are warranted </plain></SENT>
