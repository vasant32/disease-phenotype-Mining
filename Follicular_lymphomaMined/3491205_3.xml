<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Centrocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> usually expressed a heavy chain mantle zone-like phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nearly one-half of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed extension of neoplastic cells into interfollicular areas as evidenced by positivity for CD10 (common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>) and/or CD9 (immature B-cell) and CD23 (B-blast cell) antigens </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Light chain restriction could not be used to determine interfollicular involvement because of the presence of many non-neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> retained a polyclonal mantle around at least some neoplastic follicles and in no case was a monoclonal mantle seen </plain></SENT>
