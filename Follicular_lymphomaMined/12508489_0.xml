<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a 51-year-old woman with recurrent follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from the age of 47 despite chemo-radio therapy, who subsequently underwent nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation with conditioning consisting of fludarabine and low-dose total body irradiation (2 Gy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Myelosuppression</z:e> was very mild, so the patient required no transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chimerism analysis from peripheral blood showed that T-cell mixed chimerism continued over 12 months after stem cell transplantation (the percentage of recipient T-cells was approximately 20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite this, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> disappeared, and the patient developed grade II <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It has been considered that the establishment of full donor chimerism is required to induce GVHD and GVM (graft versus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>) effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this case, however, an allo-response was observed despite the persistence of T-cell mixed chimerism </plain></SENT>
