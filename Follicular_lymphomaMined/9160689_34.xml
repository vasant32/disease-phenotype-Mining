<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot analysis of fluorescence-activated cell sorted germinal center and mantle zone B cells supported the immunohistochemical results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 22 of 27 (81%) follicular small cleaved cell non-Hodgkin's B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the CPP32-immunopositive germinal center lymphocytes were replaced by CPP32-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the large cell component of follicular mixed cells (FMs) and follicular large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLCLs) was strongly CPP32 immunopositive in 12 of 17 (71%) and in 8 of 14 (57%) cases, respectively, whereas the residual small-cleaved cells were poorly stained for CPP32 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FLCLs and in 12 of 17 (71%) FMs, suggesting that an upregulation of CPP32 immunoreactivity occurred during progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, cytosolic immunostaining for CPP32 was present in 10 of 12 (83%) diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DLCLs) and 2 of 3 diffuse mixed B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DMs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunopositivity for CPP32 was also found in the majority of other types of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>Plasmacytomas</z:hpo> were CPP32 immunonegative in 4 of 12 (33%) cases, in contrast to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma cells, which uniformly contained intense CPP32 immunoreactivity, implying downregulation of CPP32 in a subset of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results show dynamic regulation of CPP32 expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
