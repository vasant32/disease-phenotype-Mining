<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: The relative timing of genetic alterations that contribute to follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed a donor-recipient pair who both developed grade 2/3A follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 7 years after allogeneic transplantation and donor lymphocyte infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both patients harbored identical BCL2/IGH rearrangements also present in 1 in 2,000 cells in the donor lymphocyte infusion, and the same V(D)J rearrangement, which underwent somatic hypermutation both before and after clonal divergence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exome sequencing of both follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> identified 15 shared mutations, of which 14 (including alterations in EP300 and KLHL6) were recovered from the donor lymphocyte infusion by ultra-deep sequencing (average read coverage, 361,723), indicating acquisition at least 7 years before clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six additional mutations were present in only one follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and not the donor lymphocyte infusion, including an ARID1A premature stop, indicating later acquisition during clonal divergence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, ultrasensitive sequencing can map <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> within rare subpopulations during human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: For the first time, we define the molecular ontogeny of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By using ultrasensitive mutation detection, we mapped the time-course of somatic alterations after passage of a malignant ancestor by hematopoietic cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
