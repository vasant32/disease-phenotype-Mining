<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18) gives rise to a rearrangement of the bcl-2 oncogene that constitutes an excellent target for detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred ninety-four previously untreated patients with indolent FL and detectable bcl-2 rearrangement were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The PCR assay was used to detect bcl-2-rearranged cells in blood and marrow before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular response rate was 37%, 53%, 56%, and 66% at 3 to 5, 6 to 8, 9 to 14, and 15 to 18 months from the start of therapy, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although molecular response was higher among clinical CRs, one third of partial responders at 3 to 5 months also achieved a molecular response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who achieved a molecular response during the first year of treatment had a significantly longer failure-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e>) than those who did not (4-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e>: 76% v 38%, respectively; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar results were also observed in the subset of patients in clinical CR 1 year after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, beta2-microglobulin (beta2-M; P &lt; .01), and molecular response (P &lt; .001) were the most important variables associated with outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When we combined beta2-M and molecular response, three prognostic groups emerged: (1) low beta2-M and molecular responders, (2) low beta2-M and nonresponders or high beta2-M and responders, and (3) high beta2-M and nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 4-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> of these 3 groups were 86%, 65%, and 23%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, patients who achieved molecular response and sustained it had better <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> than those who either reverted back to PCR-positive or who never achieved molecular response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Serial PCR analysis to determine the molecular response in FL correlates well with outcome especially when combined with pretreatment beta2-M </plain></SENT>
