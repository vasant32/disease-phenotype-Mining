<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is the largest series reported from the UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> database was searched and clinical records were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Absence of any detectable extracutaneous lesion and the expression of B-cell restricted antigens by neoplastic cells were the essential criteria for selection of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cohort included 37 (56%) males and 29 (44%) females with a mean age of 59 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most commonly involved site was the trunk and the disorder typically showed non-aggressive clinical behaviour; the majority of the patients presented with stage I (82%) disease with a tendency to remain localised to a limited area of the skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was the most common histologic subtype (35%), the next most frequent was the diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (32%) whereas marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> constituted 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority (47%) of patients were treated with radiotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localised disease</z:e> whereas chemotherapy was given in 20% of patients, with single agent <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> being most frequently used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgical excision as the sole modality of treatment was adequate in 33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival (DFS) was 91% at 1 year, 82% at 2 years and 60% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DFS was significantly lower with older age (&gt;45 years), leg lesions, generalised and multiple lesions, and for those treated with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The survival at 5 and 10 years was 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The histologic grade, leg involvement and the number of lesions were the most significant variables affecting overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Only 7 patients died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, primary cutaneous B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> represents a specific entity concerning clinical behaviour, response to treatment, and overall prognosis </plain></SENT>
