<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Human B lymphocytes can produce <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi> but the biological function of the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway in B cells is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to better understand and define the role of 5-LO in B cells, we investigated the expression of 5-LO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein in subsets of B cells from human tonsils and different types of B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on RT-PCR and western blot/immunohistochemical staining, with a polyclonal antibody raised against 5-LO, high expression of 5-LO was found in mantle zone B cells from tonsils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By contrast, only a weak expression of 5-LO was detected in germinal centre cells and no expression in plasma cells from tonsils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This pattern of 5-LO expression was preserved in malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with high expression in mantle B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) and weak or no expression in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary leukemized <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, so called B-prolymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> cells, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> cell lines also expressed 5-LO and readily produced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi> after activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present report demonstrates the expression of 5-LO mainly in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant mantle zone B cells while the expression is low or absent in germinal centre B cells and plasma cells, indicating a role of the 5-LO pathway in B cells before the cells finally differentiate to plasma cells </plain></SENT>
