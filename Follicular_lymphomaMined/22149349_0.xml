<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is the second most common type of lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in Western Europe, representing 22-40% of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence of the disease has increased in recent decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At this time, and with the arrival of new treatment options, patients' outcomes have significantly improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is therefore essential to standardize recommendations for the treatment and follow-up of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, in each clinical scenario </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Searches were performed in Medline (PubMed, 1966-present) and The Cochrane Library, using MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms whenever possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The best scientific evidence was obtained from selected randomized studies and meta-analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For recommendations where there was no scientific evidence, the consensus of clinical experts was obtained regarding clinical and therapeutic attitudes to improve the treatment of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recommendations are compiled according to: (i) induction treatment in first-line; (ii) post-induction treatment in first-line; (iii) rescue treatment after relapse; (iv) post-induction treatment in relapse and (v) subsequent treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There are different recommendations for each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They take into account different variables, such as therapeutic options, patient follow-up, laboratory and imaging data, previous response and special groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The recommendations contained in this guide have been assigned different grades (A, B, C and D), depending on the level of evidence on which they are based (where there is no scientific evidence, they follow the consensus of Good Clinical Practice: see the Appendix) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These guidelines provide healthcare professionals with updated and consensual tools for the better management of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
