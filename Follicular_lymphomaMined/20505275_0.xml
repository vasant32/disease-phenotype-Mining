<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This suggests that NF-kappaB and pathways involving NF-kappaB are possible targets for successfully treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined 28 lymph nodes from 28 patients in whom follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was diagnosed from 1996 to 2006 at our institution, which were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The specimens were stained with an antibody that could recognize activated NF-kappaB and p65 to determine whether they were positive or negative for NF-kappaB activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical courses of the 28 patients were then correlated with the results of the NF-kappaB staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 10 men and 18 women had a mean age of 57.3 years (range, 25-87 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade, 10 patients had grade 1, 16 had grade 2, and 2 had grade 3a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten patients died due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NF-kappaB was positive in 6 of the 28 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the positive and negative staining groups while taking into account the clinical course, sex, age, grade of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, prognostic index, CD10, CD23, Bcl-2, karyotype t(14;18), and survival showed that no significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six of the 28 lymph nodes (21.4%) exhibited consistent NF-kappaB activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three of the eleven cases that transformed to aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were positive for activated NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further research to clarify the significance of constitutive NF-kappaB activity in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is therefore warranted </plain></SENT>
