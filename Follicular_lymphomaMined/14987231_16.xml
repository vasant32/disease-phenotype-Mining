<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Recent studies of primary cutaneous follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> suggest that it represents a clinicopathological entity distinct from nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine if FL arising at other extranodal sites is more closely related to FL occurring in the skin or in lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifteen cases of non-cutaneous extranodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ENFL) were identified from the Scotland and Newcastle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Group (SNLG) database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were stage 1E at presentation and involved the tonsil (n = 3), palate (n = 3), skeletal muscle (n = 2), ileum (n = 2), duodenum (n = 1), stomach (n = 1), thyroid gland (n = 1), submandibular gland (n = 1) and fallopian tube (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction for t(14;18) using primers to the major breakpoint cluster region was performed on 14 cases of ENFL and the incidence of the translocation compared with that found in 16 cases of stage 1 nodal FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical and follow-up data were obtained from the SNLG database for the 15 cases of ENFL and 87 cases of stage 1 nodal FL, and a comparison of outcomes made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 2/14 cases of ENFL had detectable t(14;18) compared with 9/16 stage 1 nodal FL (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Freedom from progression and disease-specific survival was similar for the 15 cases of ENFL and 87 cases of stage 1 nodal FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, 13/15 patients with ENFL were disease free at the end of follow-up compared with 49/87 stage 1 nodal FL (P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The low incidence of t(14;18) and favourable outcome encountered in ENFL in this study is similar to that previously found for primary cutaneous FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results support the concept of a subtype of FL lacking t(14;18) involving the major breakpoint cluster region, and with a propensity to arise at extranodal sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite a high relapse rate, patients with ENFL are more likely to achieve complete remission and may ultimately have a more favourable long-term prognosis than those with equivalent nodal disease </plain></SENT>
