<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: CD20-directed therapy with rituximab is effective in many patients with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, relapse frequently occurs within 1 year, and patients become increasingly refractory to retreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to produce a compact, single-chain CD20-targeting immunotherapeutic that could offer therapeutic advantages in the treatment of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Rituximab is a chimeric antibody containing two heavy chains and two light chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe the properties of TRU-015, a small modular immunopharmaceutical specific for CD20, encoded by a single-chain construct containing a single-chain Fv specific for CD20 linked to human IgG1 hinge, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="29357,29358,29360,29361,51375,51376">CH2</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29438">CH3</z:chebi> domains but devoid of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="29433">CH1</z:chebi> and CL domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TRU-015 mediates potent direct signaling and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity but has <z:mp ids='MP_0001265'>reduced size</z:mp> and complement-mediated cytotoxicity activity compared with rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TRU-015 is a compact dimer of 104 kDa that comigrates with albumin in size exclusion chromatography and retains a long half-life in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TRU-015 induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> in multiple B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines in vitro and showed effective antitumor activity against large, established subcutaneous Ramos or Daudi xenograft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TRU-015 also showed rapid, dose-dependent, and durable <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of peripheral blood B cells following single-dose administration to nonhuman primates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results indicate that TRU-015 may improve CD20-directed therapy by effectively depleting embedded malignant B cells and nonmalignant pathogenic B cells and do so with reduced complement activation </plain></SENT>
