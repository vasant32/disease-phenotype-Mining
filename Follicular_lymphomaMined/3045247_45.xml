<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In each case, multiple independent isolates of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> population were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> represented a single clone of B cells with a unique V/J joint, different cells within each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> had accumulated multiple point mutations in the V gene during clonal expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of the mutations observed were silent, but some resulted in amino acid replacements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Identical silent mutations were often observed in independent isolates of each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By combining the current data with VH sequences obtained previously from the same cells, it was apparent that the repetitive silent mutations could not be explained solely by a genealogic tree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such mutations could represent hot spots whose tendency to mutate may be influenced by neighboring DNA sequences or by the methylation of specific <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> residues </plain></SENT>
