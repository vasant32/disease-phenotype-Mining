<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Lymphomatous ovarian involvement is an uncommon event, both for primary and systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It presents different diagnostic and therapeutic implications from the more common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677886" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="EOC">ovarian epithelial cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of imaging techniques in the diagnosis of these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight patients, aged 13 to 70 years (mean: 47) were selected from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the CT examinations performed from 1986 to 1996 to assess the most typical imaging patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients underwent a CT examination, with contiguous 8 or 10 mm thick slices and thin (4-5 mm) detailing slices; iodinated contrast agents were administered in 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients were also examined with sonography (US) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lastly, 3 patients underwent a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> examination, 2 of them with paramagnetic contrast agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were affected with non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (6 diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>--1 lymphoplasmocytoid, 2 Burkitt, 1 large cells, 1 large and oat cells, 1 immunoblastic large cells, 2 follicular large cells <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1402294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary lesions</z:e> and the other 6 had a systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; ovarian involvement was bilateral in 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lesion size always exceeded 5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ascitis was present in only one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The US patterns of the lesions were aspecific, homogeneous and hypoechoic; color Doppler US showed mild vascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CT showed clear-cut lesions, hypodense and with mild contrast enhancement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Spin-echo MRI showed homogeneous masses which were moderately hypointense on T1-weighted images and slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Gd-T1-weighted images showed mild enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The differential diagnosis of ovarian primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is usually made with ovarian epithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, which normally have a complex structure with cystic or necrotic areas and solid components usually enhancing after contrast agent administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Also <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo> and, in children, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastomas</z:hpo> usually have an inhomogeneous structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In ovarian involvement with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> the concrurrent finding of <z:mp ids='MP_0000702'>adenopathy</z:mp> can help the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the absence of typical imaging patterns, we emphasize the importance of considering ovarian <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the differential diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancers</z:e>, especially if bilateral and homogeneous, without ascitis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>These findings, uncommon in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341823" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian epithelial tumors</z:e>, can help to make the correct diagnosis </plain></SENT>
