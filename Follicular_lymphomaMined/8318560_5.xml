<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed overall survival and survival after progression in 91 patients with low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (LGFL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histological subtype was B in 75 patients and C in 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e> received involved-field radiotherapy; seven patients without bulky disease had no initial therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining 72 patients received long-term <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> (9 patients), MOPP or COPBleo (42 patients), or a CHOP-derived regimen (21 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients (46%) achieved a complete remission (CR) and 28 patients (31%) achieved a partial remission; 48 of these 70 patients relapsed or progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nineteen of the other 21 patients with stable LGFL progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two other patients failed to respond and rapidly died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two of the 67 patients with progressive or relapsed LGFL have died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was 111 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age &gt; or = 70 years, male sex, B symptoms, histological subtype follicular mixed-cell NHL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size &gt; or = 10 cm, number of extranodal sites of disease &gt; or = 2, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo>, and Ann Arbor stage III or IV were found to adversely influence overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Failure-free survival &lt; 24 months, failure to achieve a CR after the progression, initial histological subtype follicular mixed cell, initial Ann Arbor stage III or IV, and initial tumoral size &gt; or = 10 cm were found to adversely influence survival after progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that most prognostic factors for overall survival in LGFL are related to histological subtype or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Some initial adverse prognostic factors for survival may be also associated with a poor survival after progression </plain></SENT>
