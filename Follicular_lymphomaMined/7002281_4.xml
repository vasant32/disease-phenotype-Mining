<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cells grew floating in the culture medium forming characteristic balls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The doubling time of the total cell population was 38.4 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surface and cytoplasmic immunoglobulin synthesis were monoclonal gamma heavy chain and lambda light chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chromosome analysis of the cell line revealed 47/48,XY,+A with a mode of 47,XY,+1,1p-,t(2q-;3pt+),t(18q-;14q+), which was identical to that obtained from the biopsied lymph node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructurally, tight interdigitation of the cytoplasmic processes was reminiscent of the labyrinthine structure of the nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Its nodular growth pattern is discussed in relation to other lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
