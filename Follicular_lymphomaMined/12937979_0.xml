<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Efficient IgH PCR analysis can be hampered by sequence variability in the template DNA, despite of the use of degenerative primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To improve sensitivity of the B-cell clonality analysis in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, we have performed framework three-area (FR3)/joining gene (JH) IgH PCR utilizing an enzyme blend (r Tth DNA Polymerase, XL) providing both 5'--&gt;3' polymerase and 3'--&gt;5' exonuclease activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The DNA samples were extracted from FFPE biopsies of 43 mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases of so-called germinal center and post-germinal center origin, including 6 nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL), 15 gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and 22 gastric diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the cases, 31 (17 DLBCL and 14 MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) represented small endoscopic biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serial dilutions of target DNA were applied to avoid inconsistent bands that may be seen when the input amount of template is too low, which can be the case when DNA is extracted from FFPE endoscopic gastric biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using conventional Taq polymerase, consistent monoclonal product was found in 53% (23/43) of the cases (FL: 67%; MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>: 47%; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>: 55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The r Tth polymerase showed reproducible monoclonal pattern in 72% (31/43) of the cases (FL: 67%; MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>: 73%; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>: 73%); the sensitivity is compatible with one that can be detected with conventional FR3/JH PCR in fresh/frozen tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the r Tth DNA polymerase greatly improves sensitivity of FR3/JH PCR in FFPE biopsies of mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, most probably by increasing the primer matches during PCR amplification </plain></SENT>
