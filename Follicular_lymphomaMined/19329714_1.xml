<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: PCR has been shown previously to be the most sensitive technique to detect a clonal population in marrow aspirates (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="25427">MAs</z:chebi>), and the clinical standard for evaluation of bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involvement today is bone marrow trephine biopsy (BMTB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to compare morphological evaluation of B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> in BMTB (histology and immunohistochemistry) and PCR analysis in MA, with both specimens obtained at the same time, in patients with a known molecular marker of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective evaluation of 98 consecutive BMTB specimens from 60 patients with a known B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> and a previous PCR marker of the disease (BCL2 and/or IGH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Considering the IGH PCR cases alone, a B cell clone was detected in 85% and 39% of the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> (M) positive and negative groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five M(+), IGH(-) cases were found, including two cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), one case of diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and two cases of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The FLs had about 20% and 50% of BMTB involvement each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other cases had minimal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> localisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The two FLs were also BCL2-MBR(+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Use of BCL2-MBR detected <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> M(+) cases and 66% of M(-) cases whenever it was an initial marker of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IGH PCR alone is not good enough for BMTB assessment, especially in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the PCR study for BCL2 is more sensitive than <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, without any false negative results in this series, suggesting that BCL2-MBR PCR on MA can be used as an alternative and more sensitive examination for disease evaluation, providing that there is careful analysis of data, adequate knowledge of PCR pitfalls and absence of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haematological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
