<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Few large prospective studies have examined associations between <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi>) use and non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the association between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use and NHL incidence among 149,570 participants in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Prevention Study-II Nutrition cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aspirin and nonaspirin <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use were reported at enrollment in 1992 and updated on periodic follow-up questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During follow-up through 2007, 1,709 incident NHLs were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Time-dependent hazard ratios were calculated using extended Cox regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to no use, current use of 60+ <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> pills/month (aspirin and nonaspirin <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> combined) was associated with slightly higher NHL incidence (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.53), but no association with frequency of use was observed when <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> exposure was lagged by approximately 2 years (HR = 1.08, 95% CI, 0.88-1.32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Long duration regular use (current use of 30+ pills/month for â‰¥5 years) was not associated with NHL incidence (HR = 1.09, 95% CI, 0.91-1.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In subtype analyses, current use of 60+ <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> pills/month was associated with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> incidence (HR = 1.87, 95% CI, 1.08-3.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This association persisted when <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> exposure was lagged (HR = 1.76, 95% CI, 1.04-2.98) and was similar for aspirin and nonaspirin <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association of current, but not lagged, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use with risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL could be attributable to use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> to relieve symptoms of undiagnosed NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the association with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> persisted in analyses where <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use was lagged and should be investigated further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings are particularly important for aspirin as the risks and benefits of prophylactic daily use are weighed </plain></SENT>
