<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have prospectively examined 66 consecutive initial diagnostic lymph node biopsies from unselected patients suspected of having malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> for clonal immunophenotypic and immunogenotypic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By morphological and cell surface phenotypic criteria 52 had non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> derived from the B-cell lineage and in these we compared surface immunoglobulin criteria for clonality with immunoglobulin gene rearrangement as detected by JH, C kappa, and C lambda gene probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that the addition of BglII and HindIII double digests to the standard BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzymes made it possible to detect rearrangement in the vast majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and that rearrangement of both JH alleles is the rule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A rearranged heavy and/or light chain gene was detected in 47 of 52 (91%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and the JH probe alone detected rearrangements in 87% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> when multiple restriction enzymes were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, surface immunoglobulin, the standard clonal marker for monoclonal B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, was either undetectable or did not exhibit light chain restriction in 29 of 52 tumors as detected by flow cytometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, in 24 of these 29 tumor DNAs we could detect an Ig gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In follicular (nodular) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> which often gives ambiguous immunophenotypic results by cell suspension techniques, monoclonal gene rearrangements were detected in 16 of 18 tumor DNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal surface immunoglobulin was detected in only 8 of 18 of this subset of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 52 tumors were also analyzed for potential oligoclonality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found that the use of BglII, a restriction enzyme that closely spanned the JH region, increased the sensitivity of detecting rearrangements and facilitated the identification of isotype switch variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In only a single (1 of 52) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> DNA were more than two rearranged bands seen with JH, C kappa, and C lambda probes, suggesting a multiclonal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additional cases thought to potentially represent oligoclonality by immunophenotypic criteria proved to be isotype switch variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that Ig gene rearrangement is an extremely sensitive method for defining monoclonality in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell populations, particularly if multiple restriction enzymes are used, and that the vast majority of the clonal diversity seen in initial diagnostic biopsies is the result of isotypic switch within a given clone rather than true oligoclonality </plain></SENT>
