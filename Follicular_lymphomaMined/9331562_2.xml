<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a case of follicular center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FCCL) without evidence of histologic progression towards a high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, t(9;22)(q34;q11) was found simultaneously with a t(14;18)(q32;q21) and a t(8;14)(q24;q32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular studies of this case showed BCL2 and MYC rearrangements in addition to the rearrangements of immunoglobulin heavy (IGH) and lambda (IGL) loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Investigation of the t(9;22) using Southern blot and RT-PCR analysis failed to detect M-bcr or m-bcr rearrangements of BCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with ABL and BCR probes revealed presence of a "fusion" signal, but its atypical localization [der(9)] and gene order [cen-ABL-BCR-tel] indicated that this translocation differed from the t(9;22) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and did not involve either ABL or BCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, further FISH analysis using 9q34- and 22q11-specific probes localized the breakpoint on chromosome 9 distal to the NOTCH1 gene and the breakpoint on 22q11 in the IGL gene cluster </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate an IGL-mediated rearrangement of an unknown gene at 9q34 that together with BCL2 and MYC might be involved in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> of the present case of FCCL and perhaps in other cases of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in which t(9;22) is sporadically occurring </plain></SENT>
