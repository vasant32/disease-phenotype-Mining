<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three DRC patterns were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, DRCs constituted nodular networks of variable density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, DRCs were present either as isolated and scattered cells (17 cases) or constituted irregular meshworks of variable sizes (11 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These DRC patterns correlate with B cell immunophenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Like follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and unlike diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> without DRC networks, diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with DRC networks constantly expressed the pan B antigens and one marker characteristic of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> germinal center cells, CD21 antigen, the C3d receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The finding of organized DRC networks in a significant number of diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> does not substantiate the hypothesis that DRCs may play a role in the homing of neoplastic B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The correlations observed between DRC patterns and B cell immunophenotypes suggest that the persistence and/or the development of DRC networks within follicular center cell-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are related to the degree of functional differentiation of neoplastic B cells </plain></SENT>
