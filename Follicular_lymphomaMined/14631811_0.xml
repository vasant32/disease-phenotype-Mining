<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A chromosomal marker--translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21) supporting the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> diagnosis and useful for monitoring bone marrow or peripheral blood infiltration by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells is also used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The BCL2 gene (18q21) is controlled by an enhancer of the IGH gene (14q32) resulting in BCL-2 protein overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The translocation is present in the majority of patients with FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to introduce the quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR, real-time quantification) method for the assessment of the quantity of cells bearing the translocation t(14;18) in patients with FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fluorescence in situ hybridization on interphasic nuclei (I-FISH) in histologic sections was used for screening of patients with the t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A search for the break of the BCL2 gene at the major breakpoint region (mbr) was performed by means of qualitative PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We determined the relative number of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells bearing t(14;18) translocation (mbr) in patients with FL by the RQ-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relative quantity of these cells was significantly higher in the lymph nodes than in the bone marrow or peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The RQ-PCR is a tool of choice to monitor the activity of the disease in individual patients, and to detect an early disease relapse before its manifestation at the level diagnosed by <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
