<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The findings differ from previous studies, where nuclei of cells from follicle centres and interfollicular areas were measured and revealed no significant difference between follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, by measuring only follicle centre cell nuclei, it has been found that, in reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo>, the mean nuclear maximum diameter (Dmax) and area are significantly greater than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e>-centrocytic follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the standard deviation of these data is greater for reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> than follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, implying greater "scatter" or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the nuclear sizes in the follicle centre cells of the former than the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the size of these cells appears to be of value as an histological discriminator between these benign and malignant conditions </plain></SENT>
