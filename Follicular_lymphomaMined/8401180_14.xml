<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The combination of chromosomal translocations associated with bcl-2 rearrangement [t(14;18)] and c-myc rearrangement [t(8;14), t(8;22), or t(2;8)] has infrequently been detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently identified four cases of a B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> exhibiting this dual translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to t(14;18), one case had t(8;14) and three had the t(8;22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One case presented as de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL-L2), two as de novo high grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and the fourth evolved to a "blastic" phase from a previously documented follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotyping and molecular analysis was performed on three of the cases: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were negative for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) but were CD10 positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of the three cases with t(8;22) were negative for surface immunoglobulin (SIg) and positive for HLA-DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rearrangement of the oncogene bcl-2 was identified in a single case by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar to cases reported in the literature, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had a poor clinical outcome despite aggressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dual translocation lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> has a relatively characteristic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and the diagnosis should be considered when there is a history of an antecedent low grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or when there is discordance between the "blastic" <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and the immunophenotype (TdT- and/or SIg+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Confirmation requires demonstration of the characteristic translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recognition of this entity has significant clinical implications that may require consideration of alternate treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
