<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disease with variable prognosis and clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the presence of nonmalignant T cells in the microenvironment of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> may affect the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using flow cytometry, we evaluated the T-cell subsets in the lymph node microenvironment of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients in South Stockholm County with indolent follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and with flow cytometry done on a diagnostic lymph node between 1994 and 2004 were included (N = 139) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis and grade (1, 2, and 3a) were confirmed by re-review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry results were reanalyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lymphocyte subsets, the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index, grade, and clinical characteristics were evaluated in univariable and multivariable Cox analysis with respect to overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher CD8+ T-cell levels correlated with longer OS and DSS, independently of the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (OS, P = 0.017; DSS, P = 0.020) and independently of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other prognostic factors (OS, P = 0.001; DSS, P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median OS was not reached for patients in the upper quarter of CD8+ T-cell levels (&gt;8.6%), 10.4 years for patients in the middle half (4.2-8.6%), and 6.0 years for patients in the lower quarter (&lt;4.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients who had not required treatment within 6 months from diagnosis had more CD8+ T cells (P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of CD8+ T cells predict a better prognosis, and these data support an important role for nonmalignant immune cells in the biology of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Evaluating the CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry at diagnosis may provide prognostic information </plain></SENT>
