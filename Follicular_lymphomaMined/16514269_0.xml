<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the antibody has only been on the market since 1997, long-term observations are still rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We report about a patient with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who received a single treatment of 4 x 375 mg/m(2) of the monoclonal antibody rituximab without chemotherapy and has been in complete remission (CR) for 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This remarkable response duration highlights the efficacy of rituximab monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A number of recently published studies have indicated that CR of more than 4 years after rituximab monotherapy may be a regularly occurring event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These patients are likely to represent a yet poorly characterized patient group that profits considerably from rituximab monotherapy </plain></SENT>
