<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The idiotype of B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> has been intensively investigated for its proven immunogenicity as a promising <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> vaccine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Indeed, available data clearly indicate that these vaccines are able to induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific immune responses and molecular remissions in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, only one of the three phase III trials performed so far demonstrated a prolonged disease-free survival in vaccinated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The observed failures have been mainly ascribed to defects in the study design and not to the limited efficacy of idiotype vaccines per se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, innovative and optimized idiotype-based vaccine formulations are being developed in order to overcome current limitations and improve the clinical benefit of this immunotherapeutic strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the most promising advances, the development of "off-the-shelf" vaccines appears of particular relevance, being potentially able to overcome the limitations related to the complex, time-consuming and expensive production of the individualized idiotypic vaccines currently used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there is a pressing need to identify biomarkers suitable for the identification of the subset of patients who are most likely to benefit from vaccination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recent findings also indicate that idiotypic vaccines may be safely and successfully used in additional clinical settings, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
