<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We re-evaluated reported associations between tobacco use and other factors and non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) t(14; 18)-subtypes based on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays believed to be more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction (PCR), previously used for detecting t(14; 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Commercial FISH assays and bcl-2 immunostaining were performed on paraffin sections to determine t(14; 18) and bcl-2 case-subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polytomous logistic regression models estimated associations between NHL case-subtypes (versus 1,245 population-based controls) and tobacco use as well as other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adjusting for age, state, and proxy status, t(14; 18)-negative NHL was associated with any tobacco use (vs. no tobacco use, OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.0-3.5), including current smoking (vs. no cigarette use, OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.1-3.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tobacco exposures were not clearly associated with t(14; 18)-positive NHL or bcl-2 case-subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hair-dye use and family history of a hemolymphatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were associated with t(14; 18)-negative NHL, but the number of exposed cases was small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The association between t(14; 18)-negative NHL and cigarette smoking was unexpected given previous evidence of associations between smoking and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (which is largely t(14; 18)-positive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Future studies characterizing additional molecular characteristics of t(14; 18)-negative NHL may help determine whether the association with smoking may have been causal versus an artifact of chance or bias </plain></SENT>
