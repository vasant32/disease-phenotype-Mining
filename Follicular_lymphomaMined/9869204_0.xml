<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although three subtypes of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) and marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>), are now well recognized as independent categories, their biological behavior has not been fully compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the reasons for this may be that subclassification by histological examination alone is often difficult since they <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> have a common variant of a "nodular" growth pattern and occasionally show similar cytological <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, we reviewed patients with FL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>, who were prospectively diagnosed, using multiparameter analyses with unfixed fresh biopsy materials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 407 NHL patients, 101 (24.8%) belonged to these three categories and 80 could be followed; FL (n=27), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> (n=27) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> (n=26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty eight cases with diffuse large B-cell (DL-B) lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were selected as control at random </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> patients with performance status (PS) 2 to 4 (41%) was significantly higher than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> patients (4%) [P&lt; 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 3 year survival rate with FL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> and DL-B was 71.5%, 57.4%, 93.3% and 53.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The survival rate for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> was significantly better than both FL (p = 0.048) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> (p = 0.0085) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were also found in the overall survival rates among the four risk groups as defined by the International Index <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36898">[I2]</z:chebi>(low, low-intermediate, high-intermediate and high; 97.4%, 79.6%, 39.4% and 18.2%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis revealed that the International Index may be a significant predictor for short survival (p=0.0001) in the patients with FL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> shows an apparently better prognosis than FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> and is found to be a prognostically independent category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the clinical outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> is the worst among the three subtypes and was closer to that of DL-B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The International Index can be applied to a wide spectrum of NHL, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> and FL, to and can predict prognosis in these cases </plain></SENT>
