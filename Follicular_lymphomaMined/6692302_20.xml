<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four cases underwent repeat biopsy a median of 54 months after diagnosis (range, 7-116 months) because of progressive or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histologic conversion to a transformed (noncleaved) cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was found at re-biopsy in 13 of 34 cases (38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neither age, gender, stage, visceral sites of disease, nor symptoms at presentation were predictive of subsequent conversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, none of the clinical features analyzed at the time of rebiopsy were predictive of whether the rebiopsy would show stable histology or transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Documentation of transformation was of significant prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although rebiopsies were performed at the time of progressive disease, survival following re-biopsy was 37.5 months for patients found to have cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at re-biopsy, and only 2.5 months for those with transformed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at re-biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two of the cases which had immunoglobulin surface markers studied at diagnosis and at transformation, showed retention of heavy and light chain markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This implies that the change in appearance involves the original neoplastic clone and was not due to a second <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Development of transformed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is one of the most common features of the aggressive phase of indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Repeat biopsy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who have relapsing or progressive disease is recommended </plain></SENT>
