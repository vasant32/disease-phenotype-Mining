<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cell types are also present in follicles of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the neoplastic analogues of physiological germinal centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study the distribution and ultrastructural appearances of HRC and DRC present in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> germinal centres and in neoplastic follicles were established by means of morphometric methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of HRC was significantly lower in malignant follicles than in their reactive counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analysis of the cytoplasm and phagolysosomes suggest that HRC are smaller and that their activity is lower in malignant follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DRC were present in smaller numbers in these structures, as measured by nuclear counts and their relative volume within the follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ultrastructural features indicate that DRC in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are functionally less active than in reactive lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The possibility that differences between the reticulum cells from reactive and neoplastic follicles may be related to the absence of an immune reaction in malignant follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency and appearance of HRC and DRC are suitable as additional parameters to differentiate reactive secondary germinal centres from their malignant analogues </plain></SENT>
