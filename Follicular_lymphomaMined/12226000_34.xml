<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through 1998, 261 cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (137 diffuse, 58 follicular, and 32 small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) and 63 cases of B-CLL were identified by linkage to the Iowa <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Height, weight, body mass index, waist/hip ratio, and physical activity were not associated with risk of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> overall or with diffuse or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in particular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for other non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> risk factors, there was an inverse association of baseline body mass index (relative risks (RRs) across quartiles: 1, 0.4, 0.4, 0.3; p trend = 0.03) with risk of small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, for B-CLL there were suggestive positive associations with body mass index at age 50 years (RRs across quartiles: 1, 1.9, 1.5, 2.7; p trend = 0.03) and (more weakly) baseline body mass index (RRs across quartiles: 1, 1.1, 1.6, 1.3; p trend = 0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In summary, we found no evidence that height, weight, body mass, or physical activity plays an important role in non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> overall or in diffuse or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in particular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The opposite associations of body mass index with small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> versus B-CLL may be a chance finding but, if confirmed, would suggest different etiologies for these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
