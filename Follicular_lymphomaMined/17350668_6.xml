<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is classified into grades (G)1, 2, and 3 based on the number of centroblasts in neoplastic follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the accuracy of manually counting these centroblasts is limited by certain cells (large centrocytes, follicular dendritic cells, and histiocytes) that could mimic centroblast <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The reproducibility of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grading is dependent upon observer experience; therefore, significant variations occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study is to explore a more objective, reliable way of grading follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> using a quantitative imaging system in conjunction with immunostains with antibodies to proliferation markers MIB-1 and S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (G1, n = 23; G2, n = 18; and G3, n = 17) were studied on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positive nuclear staining of both Ki-67 and SKP2 was recorded using the quantitative Clarient ACIS II system (Aliso Viejo, CA, USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten high-power fields (x400) from randomly selected neoplastic follicles were counted by a pathologist blinded to the previously assigned morphologic grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results show that the percentages of Ki-67+ and SKP2+ cells significantly differ among the different grades of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A higher grade of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is associated with a higher percentage of Ki-67+ and SKP2+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall SKP2+% cells are substantially lower than Ki-67+% cells in the same grade of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Statistical significance is observed in Ki-67+ cells between follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> G1 and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> G3 and between G1 and G2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, statistical significance is noted in SKP2+% cells between follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> G1 and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> G3 and between follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> G2 and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> G3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that the SKP2 expression has better discrimination with grades of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> than Ki-67 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Compared with traditional methods, quantitation of SKP2 expression using a quantitative image analysis system might be a useful and objective approach in grading follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
