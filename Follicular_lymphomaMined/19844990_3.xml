<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gene expression analyses have identified genes changing on transformation but have failed to be reproducible in different studies, reflecting the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue and between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gene expression analyses on Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays were performed, using flow cytometry sorted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells derived from FL and transformed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To identify molecular targets associated with the transformation, subsequent immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses of the corresponding proteins were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using highly purified cells, this study identified 163 genes, which were significantly deregulated during the transformation in a majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the upregulated transcripts, 13 genes were selected for validation using IHC, based on the availability of commercial antibodies, and galectin-3 and NEK2 proteins specifically identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">tr</z:e>, when compared with FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that by purifying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells through cell sorting, thereby reducing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> due to infiltrating cells, it was possible to identify distinct differences between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> entities rather than variations due to cellular composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Galectin-3 and NEK2 both identified a subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">tr</z:e>, and the function of these protein markers also suggests a biological role in the transformation process </plain></SENT>
