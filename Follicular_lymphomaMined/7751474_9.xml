<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2 gene is frequently rearranged in nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> as well as in diffuse lymphoproliferations, but has generally been regarded as most useful in the recognition of the former of these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known regarding BCLP expression in cutaneous lymphoid infiltrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using an immunohistochemical technique and a monoclonal antibody (clone no. 124) the authors examined 67 examples of cutaneous lymphoid infiltrates--31 cases of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the skin (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MLS</z:e>) and 36 examples of cutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasias</z:mp> (CLH)--to determine if patterns of BCLP reactivity could distinguish CLH from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MLS</z:e> or primary from secondary involvement of the skin by malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight per cent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MLS</z:e> cases were BCL-positive, as were 33% of CLH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of four cases of follicular cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed BCLP-positivity in neoplastic follicles, whereas similar structures in cases of CLH with a follicular pattern were BCLP-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixty per cent of primary MLSs and 57% of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were reactive for BCLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that immunostains for BCLP are of little help in the separation of benign from malignant cutaneous lymphoid infiltrates, and that they are likewise incapable of separating primary from secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MLS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BCLP immunostains may have a limited adjuvant diagnostic role in distinguishing reactive from neoplastic follicular lymphoid lesions of the skin </plain></SENT>
