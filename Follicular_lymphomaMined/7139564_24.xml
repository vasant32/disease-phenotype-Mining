<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CS II (70%) or PS II (69%) nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar treatment regimens were less effective in diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, CS I (53%) or PS I (57%) and CS II (50%) or PS II (51%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using chemotherapy or combined modality approaches, complete responses were obtained in a high proportion of advanced nodular disease patients, CS III (51%) or PS (59%), CS IV (44%), or PS IV (46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With the introduction of combination chemotherapy and/or modern radiotherapeutic techniques, 52% CS III and 63% PS III, and 47% CS IV and 46% PS IV patients achieved a complete response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tend to have higher complete response rates and longer survivals than their counterparts with diffuse histologic types (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with nodular lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had a better survival than those with mixed or "histiocytic" histologic types (P less than 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with diffuse well differentiated lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> survived significantly longer than patients with other diffuse histologic types (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Percentage and prominence of nodularity were not of prognostic significance in those patients with combined nodular and diffuse patterns of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When compared by histologic type, patient sex did not appear to be an important prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The presence of B-symptoms was associated with a poorer survival in patients with nodular disease (P less than 0.05) and in patients with diffuse disease (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Over the years of this study, survival appears to have improved in each histologic subtype except DPDL </plain></SENT>
