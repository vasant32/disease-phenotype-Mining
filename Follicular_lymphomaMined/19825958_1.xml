<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50161">Motexafin gadolinium</z:chebi> is a novel anticancer agent that targets redox-dependent pathways and enhances sensitivity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells to ionizing radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We did preclinical studies examining <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50161">motexafin gadolinium</z:chebi> combined with rituximab and/or radiation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We subsequently completed a phase I clinical trial combining escalating doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50161">motexafin gadolinium</z:chebi> concurrently with standard [(90)Y]ibritumomab tiuxetan for patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In HF1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50161">motexafin gadolinium</z:chebi> and rituximab resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity (combination index, 0.757) through a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo>-mediated caspase-dependent pathway, whereas cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in Ramos and SUDHL4 cells was additive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50161">Motexafin gadolinium</z:chebi>/rituximab combined with radiation (1-3 Gy) resulted in additive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight of 30 patients were evaluable on the phase I clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median age was 65 years (47-87 years), and histologies were marginal-zone (n = 1), mantle-cell (n = 3), diffuse large cell (n = 6), and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, 86% were rituximab refractory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therapy was well tolerated, and no dose-limiting toxicity was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall response rate was 57% [complete remission (CR), 43%], with median time-to-treatment failure of 10 months (1-48+ months) and median duration-of-response of 17 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of note, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> responses were documented at 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in rituximab-refractory follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 14), overall response rate was 86% (CR, 64%), with a median time-to-treatment failure of 14 months (2-48+ months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This represents the first report of a novel agent to be combined safely concurrently with radioimmunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> responses with [(90)Y]ibritumomab tiuxetan/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50161">motexafin gadolinium</z:chebi> were prompt with a high rate of CRs, especially in rituximab-refractory follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
