<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared time-to-event variables obtained before and after RIT-Z in patients with relapsed FL, previously exposed to rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with relapsed non-transformed, non-refractory, non-rituximab-naïve FL who have been treated with RIT-Z in two different centres in Europe were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Staging and response were assessed by contrast-enhanced CT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients; PET/CT was performed according to local availability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival (EFS) and time to next treatment (TTNT) following the last previous therapy and after RIT-Z were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre-therapy characteristics were tested in univariate analyses for prediction of outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A description of the patterns of relapse was also provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 70 patients treated, only 16 fulfilled the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They were treated with a median of 3 prior lines of chemo-immunotherapies, including a median of 2 rituximab-containing regimens; 6 patients had undergone myeloablative chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue (ASCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall response rates were 10 (62%) CR/CRu, 3 (19%) PR and 3 (19%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>; response rates were similar in patients with prior ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After RIT-Z only few patients obtained EFS and TTNT longer than after the last previous therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four patients receiving rituximab maintenance were without progression 12 months after RIT-Z </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Relapses occurred in both previously and newly involved sites; a significant association was found between the number of pathologic sites involved prior to RIT-Z and subsequent TTNT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Despite the excellent response rate, the duration of response was shorter than the previous one confirming the known trend of relapses to occur earlier after subsequent treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Rituximab maintenance after RIT-Z showed encouraging results in terms of prolonging EFS, warranting further studies </plain></SENT>
