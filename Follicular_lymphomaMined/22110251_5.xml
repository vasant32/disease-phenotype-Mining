<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed gene expression, miRNA profile, and copy number data from 15 NMZL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For comparison, 16 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs), 9 extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and 8 reactive lymph nodes and B-cell subtypes were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were validated by quantitative RT-PCR in an independent series, including 61 paraffin-embedded NMZLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NMZL signature showed an enriched expression of gene sets identifying interleukins, integrins, CD40, PI3K, NF-κB, and TGF-β, and included genes expressed by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marginal zone cells and memory B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most highly overexpressed genes were SYK, TACI, CD74, CD82, and CDC42EP5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genes linked to G(2)/M and germinal center were down-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the gene expression profiles of NMZL and FL showed enriched expression of CHIT1, TGFB1, and TACI in NMZL, and BCL6, LMO2, and CD10 in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NMZL displayed increased expression of miR-221, miR-223, and let-7f, whereas FL strongly expressed miR-494 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study identifies new candidate diagnostic molecules for NMZL and reveals survival pathways activated in NMZL </plain></SENT>
