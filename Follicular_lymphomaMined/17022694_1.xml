<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The genetic lesion underlying the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPDs</z:e>) has been identified in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A point mutation in codon 617 causes a valine to phenylalanine substitution (V617F) in the JH2 autoinhibitory region of the protein, resulting in constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The high prevalence of this conserved mutation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> makes it an excellent candidate as a diagnostic molecular marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We report here the development and validation of a single oligonucleotide probe-based PCR approach using fluorescence melting curve analysis for point mutation detection in DNA derived from unfractionated peripheral blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using this assay and serial dilutions of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> cell line harboring the homozygous JAK2 V617F mutation, we successfully detected the mutation within a background of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> sequences at a sensitivity of 2.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our novel fluorescence probe-based assay was compared with allele-specific PCR-gel assay and sequencing techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using the single probe assay, we examined 70 cases with a presumptive diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e>, of which 38 (54%) yielded positive results for the presence of the JAK2 V617F mutation, and 92 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases, which were negative for the JAK2 V617F mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the probe-based assay detected a previously unreported T&gt;C base substitution at nucleotide 2342 (JAK2, codon 616), which was not detected by an allele-specific PCR assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The single <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39442">fluorescent probe</z:chebi>-based assay described here is a rapid, homogeneous, and robust method for the detection of the JAK2 V617F mutation with favorable performance characteristics that make it advantageous for clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
