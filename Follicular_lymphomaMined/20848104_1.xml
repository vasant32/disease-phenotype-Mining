<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this context we have evaluated the efficacy and safety of combined fludarabine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (FC) upfront therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three patients with advanced INFL were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therapy consisted in FC combination (25 and 250 mg/m(2), i.v., respectively, for three consecutive days) every 28 days for six courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After histological review, 61 patients (36 men, median age 64 years, range 40-70 years) were evaluated (22 small lymphocytic, 11 lymphoplasmacytic, 25 marginal zone and 3 CD5-negative non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> not otherwise specified) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further two patients were excluded for lack of essential data; six patients were withdrawn before the third cycle because of WHO grade III and IV toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the final evaluation, the overall response rate was 83% with 40.7% of complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intention-to-treat analysis showed that at the median follow-up of 36 months, overall survival, progression-free survival and failure-free survival were respectively 78%, 60% and 46%; remission duration among the 49 patients achieving complete remission/partial remission at the end of treatment was 65% (44-78) without significant differences between the main histotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequent grade III and IV toxic events were haematological (neutropaenia 34%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> 18% and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040034" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombocytopaenia</z:e> 11%) and infectious (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FC is effective for advanced untreated INFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and haematological toxicity suggest careful patient selection and monitoring </plain></SENT>
