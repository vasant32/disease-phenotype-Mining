<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 44-year-old woman with a 12-year history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sj√∂gren's syndrome</z:e> (SS) developed a low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the parotid gland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two years later, she presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008940'>generalized lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo> and a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the relationship of the two histologically distinct <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, we re-examined their histology and immunophenotype and studied the lymphomatous tissue from the parotid, cervical lymph node, and spleen using molecular genetic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histologic and immunophenotypic studies confirmed the previous diagnoses and also identified a previously unnoticed focus of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the second parotid gland biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the rearranged Ig heavy-chain gene showed the same sized dominant product in the MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, PCR analysis of the t(14:18) translocation yielded an identical sized band from both MALT and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cloning and sequencing of the Ig PCR products showed an identical CDR3 sequence from each lesion, indicating a common clonal lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the parotid gland lymph node and the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the spleen showed an identical mutation signature to that of the salivary gland MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the parotid gland lymph node may have resulted from colonization of lymphoid follicles by MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, following which the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were induced to express a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> phenotype, due to Bcl-2 overexpression caused by t(14;18), leading to a change in clinical behavior resulting in rapid widespread dissemination of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that the distinct phenotypes of low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> may be the consequence of interplay between genetic and local microenvironmental factors </plain></SENT>
