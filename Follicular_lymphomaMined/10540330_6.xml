<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four auto-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-reactive CD4(+) <z:chebi fb="15" ids="48347">TCC</z:chebi> were derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TIL-T) from a freshly isolated human follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> by the following technique: total CD4(+) TIL-T were negatively purified by an immunomagnetic procedure, then CD4(+) <z:chebi fb="15" ids="48347">TCC</z:chebi> were obtained by limiting dilution in the presence of IL-2 and autologous non-irradiated follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells as feeders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After expansion, these CD4(+) <z:chebi fb="15" ids="48347">TCC</z:chebi> were co-cultured with non-irradiated autologous malignant B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four <z:chebi fb="15" ids="48347">TCC</z:chebi> were activated by B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and proliferated, as assessed by CD25 expression and cell cycle analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Activation and proliferation of B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were studied in response to activated CD4(+) T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four <z:chebi fb="15" ids="48347">TCC</z:chebi> were able to induce B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell activation (Ki-67 antigen induction and CD40 up-regulation), cells were subsequently blocked in G1 phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Activation of B-NHL cells was mediated by TCR-HLA class II interaction, as shown by a blocking experiment using an anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since anti-CD40 mAb with or without IL-4 did not induce proliferation of B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in contrast to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells, we suggest that the blockade in G1 phase is due to the presence of abnormalities in B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first evidence that autologous reactive CD4(+) <z:chebi fb="15" ids="48347">TCC</z:chebi> can engage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B cells to enter the cell cycle and induce an aborted activation stage </plain></SENT>
