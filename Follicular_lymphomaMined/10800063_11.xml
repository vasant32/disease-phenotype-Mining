<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy patients were enrolled in first remission, whereas 41 were treated in second or higher remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High-dose therapy consisted of total body irradiation plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> in 103 patients, while eight patients received BEAM (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="3423">carmustine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi>, melphalan) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autografts contained 8.1 +/- 0.6 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 44.2 months from PBSCT (range 4.9-77.4 months), 93 patients are alive, with a probability of overall and relapse-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) of 83% and 64%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher probability of relapse was associated with male gender, involvement of more than eight lymph node areas, extra-nodal manifestations other than bone marrow and PBSCT performed in second or higher remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the latter group of patients, previous radiotherapy was associated with poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relevance of chemosensitivity as a prognostic factor was reflected by a better <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> in patients who had achieved complete remission at the time of PBSC mobilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, involvement of eight or more lymph nodes and high-dose therapy performed in second or higher remission were independent prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
