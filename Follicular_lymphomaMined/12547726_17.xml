<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the pattern of somatic hypermutation of the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain genes on 23 cases and have correlated these data with survival as well as immunophenotypic and genetic characteristics of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two-thirds of the cases show immunoglobulin gene mutations, half of which show evidence of antigen selection, whereas one-third of the cases show no significant mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On-going mutation, a feature characteristic of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, was demonstrated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six cases randomly selected for this analysis, including one case with a low number of mutations (&lt;2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No statistical significant correlation was found between immunoglobulin mutation status and clinical, immunophenotypic, or genetic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that on-going somatic hypermutation is a prominent feature of splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with circulating villous lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On-going somatic hypermutation has previously been demonstrated in extra-nodal and nodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> at different anatomical localizations may derive from a similar B-cell subset </plain></SENT>
