<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each subtype has a distinctive natural history, response to therapy and survival, and precise histologic diagnosis is essential for optimal treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, recent studies by a panel of seven expert hematopathologists showed that there was a 20% to 40% likelihood of disagreement in subtyping non-Hodgkin's follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; thus, the likelihood of a patient receiving inappropriate treatment is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To resolve some of the problems relating to subjective morphologic diagnosis, we have continued to investigate the possibility of using computerized image analysis to perform automated subtyping of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the portion of the study reported herein, a total of 37 cases were selected from the set subtyped by the panel of expert hematopathologists, and digitized images of slides from each case were processed by computer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The computer-generated subtypes were compared with those arrived at by the panel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the cases analyzed, the computer subtyping was at least as good as, and in some instances superior to, that of most of the expert panelists </plain></SENT>
