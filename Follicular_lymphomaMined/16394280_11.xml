<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from 1307 NHLs (excluding primary cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278494" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MGUS">monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance</z:e>) were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Current status was available for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Except for 29 cases of small lymphocytic (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e>), lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL), and <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> (MM), which were diagnosed cytologically, diagnoses were reclassified on paraffin wax embedded archival material according to new World Health Organisation criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sex specific age adjusted standardised incidence rates were computed using Segi's population weighting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Annual incidence changes were calculated by weighted least square regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NHL more frequently affected men (male/female ratio, 1.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean age of occurrence was 61 and 66 years for men and women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate of 14.3 remained constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e> in men, and a decrease in MM in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall DSS was 64% during the mean follow up (43 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Age, T-NHL, lambda light chain restriction in MM, and male sex in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e> were associated with poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In B-NHL, DSS decreased in the following order: hairy cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, ALL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, CLL, MM, and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of NHL in Tyrol has changed in the past decade, with a significant increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e> in men, and decrease in MM in women </plain></SENT>
