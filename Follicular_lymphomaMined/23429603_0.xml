<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the gene expression and miRNA profiles of 31 splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For comparison, 7 spleens with reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp>, 10 spleens infiltrated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, 12 spleens with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 6 spleens infiltrated by mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 15 lymph nodes infiltrated by nodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were validated by qRT-PCR in an independent series including 77 paraffin-embedded splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> miRNA signature had deregulated expression of 51 miRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most highly overexpressed miRNAs were miR-155, miR-21, miR-34a, miR-193b and miR-100, while the most repressed miRNAs were miR-377, miR-27b, miR-145, miR-376a and miR-424 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MiRNAs located in 14q32-31 were underexpressed in splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> compared with reactive lymphoid tissues and other B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, the gene expression data were integrated with the miRNA profile to identify functional relationships between genes and deregulated miRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study reveals miRNAs that are deregulated in splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and identifies new candidate diagnostic molecules for splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 22 February 2013; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2012.220 </plain></SENT>
