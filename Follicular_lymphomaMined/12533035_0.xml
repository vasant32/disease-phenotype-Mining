<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the clinico-biological characteristics and the outcome of patients with PCFL and with limited stage NFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A group of 22 consecutive patients with PCFL presenting with single or multiple cutaneous lesions was compared to a group of 21 patients with limited stage NFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age was 56 and 55 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The histologic features were compared, as well as treatment modalities and response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of PCFL consisted of restricted field radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy (CHT) and combined modalities (CM) in 12, 5 and 5 cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 21 patients with NFL, RT was employed in 13, CHT in 7 and the CM in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The response to treatment was: 17 complete responses, CR (12 RT, 2 CHT, 3 CM), 3 partial responses, PR (1 CHT, 2 CM) and 2 non-responses, NR (2 CHT) in the PCFL group, while in the NFL group 18 patients attained CR (13 RT, 4 CHT, 1 CM) and 3 PR (3 CHT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relapse rate was 22.7 and 28.5% in PCFL and NFL, respectively (median follow up of 48 and 50 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The estimated 4 years event free survival (EFS) in the PCFL and NFL patients were 68 and 70%, respectively, (P = 0.83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The estimated 4 years overall survival (OS) in the PCFL and NFL groups were 90% and 100% respectively, (P = 0.254) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among the 22 patients with PCFL, there was a higher incidence of large cells than in NFL, although the differences were not significant (P = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, despite histologic (higher proportion of large cells) and biologic differences, cutaneous and limited stage NFL show similar responses to treatment, with similar relapse rates, EFS and OS </plain></SENT>
