<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although CD5 is expressed in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (B-CLL) and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the presence of other T-cell antigens is less common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This article reports a retrospective multicenter analysis in which flow cytometry was used to evaluate aberrant CD8 expression on the pathologic B cells of 951 bone marrow samples from patients with various types of B-NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a total of 18 patients, CD8 was coexpressed: 10 had B-CLL; 1, small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>); 1, marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; 1, lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; 2, diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; and 3, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a 1.89% overall frequency of CD8 coexpression in which B-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e> had a higher frequency (3.03%) than did the other B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (1.18%) </plain></SENT>
