<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A major obstacle to investigations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> is the paucity of malignant cells, i.e., Reed-Sternberg cells and their variants, in tissues of patients with this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the pathogenesis, cell of origin, and clonality of this relatively frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> have remained unresolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results of recent studies suggest that in some instances Reed-Sternberg cells carry rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain joining region (JH) loci as well as chromosomal translocations involving band 14q32 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prompted by these findings, we sought to determine if the t(14;18) (q32;q21) translocation of follicular, non-Hodgkin's B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To detect the possible t(14;18) (q32;q21) translocation within the rare malignant cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, we amplified sequences created by the t(14;18) translocation using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With this approach, DNA sequences carrying the direct fusion of the major breakpoint region of the candidate oncogene, bcl-2, derived from chromosome 18q21, with JH on chromosome 14q32 can be detected in as few as one in 10(5)-10(6) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the present study, joined bcl-2/JH sequences were detected in tissues involved by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> in 17 of 53 (32%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequent association of bcl-2 translocation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> suggests that this oncogene has a role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>That bcl-2 is involved in a major class of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in addition to follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> implies a role for additional factors responsible for generating the two distinctive clinical and pathologic <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
