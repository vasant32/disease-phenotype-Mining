<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clinical and biological studies on nodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NMZL) are hampered by the lack of specific diagnostic markers and the low reproducibility of this diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A comparative expression-profiling study has shown a set of markers to be differentially expressed in NMZL compared with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), including myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA), a nuclear protein expressed by myeloid cells and a subset of B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize the expression of MNDA in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and reactive human tissue, and in a large series of non-Hodgkin's B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, with particular emphasis on NMZL and FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that MNDA is expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue by a subset of the marginal zone B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They also showed MNDA expression in subgroups of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but MNDA was especially expressed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> derived from the marginal zone, such as mucosa-associated lymphoid-tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, splenic marginal-zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and NMZL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MNDA expression was rarely observed in FL, a characteristic that is of potential value in distinguishing between NMZL and FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MNDA expression is thus a useful tool for the recognition of NMZL </plain></SENT>
