<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, there has been no integrated analysis based on grade, phenotype, and genotype from large numbers of FL cases in a representative Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we graded 98 FL cases; fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to determine the BCL2 and BCL6 translocation statuses, and these were compared with morphologic and immunohistochemical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expressions of the 4 antigens were B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (BCL)-2(88.8%), BCL-6(80.6%), CD10(62.2%), and Ki67(50.0%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of BCL2 and BCL6 translocations were 58.5% and 16.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the incidence of IgH/BCL2-positive FL in Chinese patients is relatively lower compared with that in western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BCL2 translocation strongly correlated with CD10 and Ki67 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data confirm the presence of a relationship between the translocation status and the FL histologic grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> BCL6 translocations occurred in high-grade FL, and this suggests that FL carrying BCL6 translocation probably constitute a special biological subtype </plain></SENT>
