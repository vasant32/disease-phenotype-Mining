<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To study the response rates and duration of response after low-dose (4 Gy) involved field radiotherapy (LD-IF-RT) in patients with recurrent indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 109 assessable patients (304 symptomatic sites) were irradiated (53 males and 56 females; median age, 62 years; range, 35 to 93), including 98 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (43 grade 1 and 55 grade 2), nine extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue-type and two patients with lymphoplasmacytoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bulky disease (&gt; or =5 cm) was present in 52% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A median of two prior regimens (range, 0 to 11) preceded LD-IF-RT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median time since diagnosis was 41 months (range, 2 to 358 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Time to (local) progression was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences in response rates between treatments within the same patient were compared using the McNemar test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response rate was 92%; complete response was reached in 67 patients (61%), partial response in 34 patients (31%), stable disease in six patients (6%), and progressive disease in two patients (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median time to progression was 14 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median time to local progression was 25 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 67 patients with complete response showed a median time to progression of 25 months and a median time to local progression of 42 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the factors studied (age, sex, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade, radiotherapy regimen, number of previous regimens and previous history, number of positive sites or largest <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diameter) were found to be related to response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LD-IF-RT is a valuable asset in the management of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and should be considered in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
