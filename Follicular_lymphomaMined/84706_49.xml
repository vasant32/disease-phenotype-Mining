<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study design emphasized histopathology review and systematic restaging to define complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Confirmed rates of CR for 443 evaluable patients were 59% for 286 patients receiving the CHOP regimens and 59% for 157 patients receiving COP-Bleo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rates of CR were higher for patients with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (69%) compared to those with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (54%) (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For patients with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> there was no difference in CR rates according to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For patients with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> the CR rate was higher with the CHOP programs (58%) than with COP-Bleo (44%) (p = 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall duration of CR and survival was significantly longer for patients with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> compared to diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At this time, remission duration and survival were similar regardless of induction regimen used in patients with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in patients with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the duration of CR and overall survival were improved by treatment with the CHOP regimens compared to COP-Bleo (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, in this controlled study we have demonstrated that initial combination chemotherapy employing the CHOP regimen was a superior remission induction therapy for patients with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
