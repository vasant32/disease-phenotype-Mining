<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty patients enrolled: 59 were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> 1.3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 for up to eight 21-day cycles; responders could receive 4 additional cycles; maintenance was optional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three evaluable patients completed more than 2 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age was 70 years, 53% female, Ann Arbor stage III-IIIE (28%) and IV (65%); 43 patients (72%) had more than 2 prior regimens; and 6 patients went on to maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall responses are as follows: 1 complete response (1.9%), 3 unconfirmed complete response (5.7%), 3 partial response (5.7%), 34 stable disease (64.2%), and 12 progressive disease (22.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median time to response = 2.2 months (range, 1.2-5.3 months); duration of response = 7.9 months (2.8-21.3 months); 1-year survival was 73% and 2-year survival was 58%; median survival = 27.7 months (range, 1.4-30.9 months); median progression-free survival = 5.1 months (range, 0.2-27.7 months), median time to progression = 5.1 months (range, 0.2-27.7 months), and median event-free survival = 1.8 months (range, 0.2-27.7 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events included: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (20%), <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (10%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (8.5%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (6.8% each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> has modest activity against marginal zone and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; it has the potential for combination with other agents in low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
