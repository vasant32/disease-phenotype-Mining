<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Generally, tissues from such patients are preserved as formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of the time, retrieving the molecular information from such samples is hampered due to quality of preservation, extraction procedures and reaction conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we isolate the chromosomal DNA from the paraffin-embedded nodal tissues of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients and use a highly sensitive nested PCR approach to detect t(14;18) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our studies show that despite the sheared DNA obtained, appropriate modification of PCR reaction conditions can help in obtaining the desired amplifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The DNA extraction protocol from paraffin-embedded nodal tissues and modifications in the PCR conditions are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study would contribute to the successful use of archival tissue samples in obtaining valuable information for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> research </plain></SENT>
