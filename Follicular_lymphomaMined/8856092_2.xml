<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The presence of bcl-2 in myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> has been associated with a decrease in therapy-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, reduced patient survival and in vitro autonomous growth of leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study focuses on the quantitation of resistance to increasing doses of 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C) by using <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological tumors</z:e> expressing different levels of bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Scanning densitometry of Western blots demonstrated that the myeloid U-937 cells express low levels of bcl-2 (RD = 0.008), whereas the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> RL-7 expressed very high levels (RD = 3.084) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Colony formation was also examined following incubation with Ara-C and RL-7 cells demonstrated a higher clonogenic survival (LD50 = 0.5 microns) when compared with U-937 cells (LD50 = 0.005 microM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the level of bcl-2 expression in each cell line was also related to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> with U-937 cells demonstrating increased DNA fragmentation when compared with RL-7 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To further evaluate the effect of upregulated bcl-2 on Ara-C treatment, U-937 cells were transfected with a retroviral vector carrying the murine bcl-2 or vector alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Upregulation of bcl-2 by myeloid leukemic cells increased the resistance by 3 logs to Ara-C when comparing LD50 values from clonogenic assays, and <z:mp ids='MP_0006043'>decreased apoptosis</z:mp> by at least 3 logs when measuring <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> positive cells by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
