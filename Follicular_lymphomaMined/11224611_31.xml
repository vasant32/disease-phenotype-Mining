<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We observed a prominent follicular growth pattern in three cases of nodal peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, of which two were initially diagnosed as follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients were male, ranged in age from 50 to 70 years, and had <z:hpo ids='HP_0008940'>generalized lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The follicles were sharply demarcated in two cases and large and vague in one case; in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, they contained abundant follicular dendritic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neoplastic cells were small to medium, with irregular cleaved or round nuclei and clear cytoplasm, which was abundant in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases were CD4+ CD8- CD57- bcl-6, with CD10 coexpression in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clonal rearrangement of the gamma chain of the T-cell receptor gene was demonstrated in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These cases expand the differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with a follicular growth pattern and suggest that neoplastic T cells may have the capacity to induce or home to follicular structures </plain></SENT>
