<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lymphoplasmacytoid (LPC) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024419" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia</z:e> (WM), and mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) also present with advanced-stage disease and are incurable with standard alkylator-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A phase II trial was undertaken to determine the activity of F-<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> in patients newly diagnosed with these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1992 and 1996, 78 patients (aged 18 to 75 years) received intravenous F-<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> (25 mg/m2/d for 5 days, every 4 weeks) until maximum response, plus two further cycles as consolidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was response rate; secondary end points included time to progression (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>), duration of response, and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-four (62%) of 71 assessable patients had a response to F-<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> (LPC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 63%; WM, 79%; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, 41%); the CR rate was 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 1.5 years, 19 of 44 responding patients have had progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; the median duration of response was 2.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival has not yet been reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the duration of response or OS between patients with different histologies; <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> was shorter in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> (P = .015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Myelosuppression</z:e> was relatively common, and the treatment-related mortality (TRM) was 5%, mostly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Single-agent fludarabine phosphate is active in previously untreated LPC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and WM, with only moderate activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the CR rate is low, and the TRM is relatively high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Its role in combination chemotherapy remains to be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
