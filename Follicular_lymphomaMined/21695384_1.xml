<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A detailed history of dietary practices and food preferences was collected using a food frequency questionnaire from 348 cases and 470 controls in a population-based, case-control study conducted in Nebraska during 1999-2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Risk for the highest versus lowest quartile or tertile of intake was estimated by odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A lower risk of overall NHL was associated with a high intake of green leafy vegetables (OR = 0.6; CI = 0.3-1.0) and cruciferous vegetables (OR = 0.7; CI = 0.4-1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis by subtype showed that green leafy vegetable intake was associated with a lower risk of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR = 0.5; CI = 0.3-0.8) and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) (OR = 0.5; CI = 0.3-0.9), while consumption of cruciferous vegetables was associated with a lower risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (OR = 0.4; CI = 0.2-0.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No association was found with intake of total vegetables, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="23042">carotene</z:chebi>-rich vegetables, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fruit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For nutrients, the risk of NHL overall was inversely associated with a higher intake of β-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="10362">cryptoxanthin</z:chebi> (OR = 0.6; CI = 0.4-0.9), <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> (OR = 0.4; CI = 0.2-0.6), <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> (OR = 0.5; CI = 0.3-1.0), and fiber (OR = 0.6; CI = 0.3-1.0), but positively associated with a higher intake of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> (OR = 1.7; CI = 1.1-2.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intakes of vitamin E, <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> were inversely associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A higher intake of green leafy vegetables and cruciferous vegetables is associated with a lower risk of NHL overall, particularly follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
