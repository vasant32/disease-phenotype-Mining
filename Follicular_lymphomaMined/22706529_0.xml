<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We experienced one such case, classical Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (cHL) associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lymph node infarction</z:e>, in which Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells were positive for CD15, CD30, fascin, PAX-5, p53, latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1), Bcl-2, and EBV-encoded small non-polyadenylated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, RS cells in the infarcted area were still positive for CD30, fascin, p53, and Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For definitive diagnosis of nodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> including Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, identification of the effacement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> nodal architecture is essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although this could not be evaluated in our case because of predominant reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> with interfollicular distribution of RS cells, the presence of large cells with RS cell-related molecules together with the distorted distribution of cCD3-positive cells and CD20-positive cells led us to make a definitive diagnosis of cHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is, therefore, considered that immunohistochemical evaluation of the infarcted lymph node is, at least on some occasions, still informative for more accurate diagnosis of lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> should also be considered when one encounters <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lymph node infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
