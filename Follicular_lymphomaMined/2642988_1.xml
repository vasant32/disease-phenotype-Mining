<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>alpha-Enolase-positive cells were not observed in reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002840'>lymphadenitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the lymphocytes including germinal center cells were positive for beta-enolase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Small lymphocytes in the mantle zones were negative, centrocytes were negative or weakly positive, the majority of centroblasts were strongly positive and the remaining were weakly positive for gamma-enolase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 patients with childhood non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e>, leukemic lymphocytes were strongly positive only for alpha-enolase </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four of five patients with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, diffuse, small cleaved cell, showed the reactivity of alpha-, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30225">beta+</z:chebi>, gamma+-enolases in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest the possibility of the two isoenzyme switches from alpha- to beta-enolase and from alpha- to gamma-enolase in the B lymphocyte lineage accompanying differentiation, similar to those of skeletal muscles and neurons </plain></SENT>
