<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 91 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred in the patient cohort over a median follow-up period of 8.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No association with OS was detected for a dietary pattern characterized by high intakes of fruits, vegetables, and <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi>; fruit intake; vegetable intake; or nutrient intake in patients diagnosed with overall NHL, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, or diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Higher intakes of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="23042">carotene</z:chebi>-rich vegetables (HR=0.4 [0.2-1.0]; ptrend=0.05) and Î±-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="23042">carotene</z:chebi> (HRT3 vs. T1=0.4 [0.2-0.9]; ptrend=0.03) were associated with better OS among ever smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, our data suggest that the intake of fruits and vegetables prior to diagnosis is not associated with OS in NHL patients </plain></SENT>
