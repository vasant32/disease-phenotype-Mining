<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Although rituximab is now routinely used in the treatment of B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the mechanism of its antitumor effect is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One potential mechanism of action involves antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two aspects of ADCC influence the effectiveness of this process: the susceptibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and the activation of effector cells via their immunoglobulin G fragment C receptors (Fc gamma Rs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several Fc gamma R polymorphisms have been identified that may affect the killing function of natural killer cells and macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The pretreatment <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells from 43 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were tested for their intrinsic susceptibility to rituximab-mediated ADCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the Fc gamma RIIIa (CD16) and Fc gamma RIIa (CD32) polymorphisms were determined in an expanded group of 87 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results were then correlated with clinical outcome of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No difference was found between the susceptibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from patients who clinically responded to rituximab versus those who did not respond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, both the Fc gamma RIIIa 158 valine/valine and the Fc gamma RIIa 131 histidine/histidine genotypes were found to be independently associated with the response rate and freedom from progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data support the hypothesis that ADCC plays an important role in the clinical effect of rituximab at the level of the effector cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It will be important to include information on Fc receptor polymorphisms in future trials of rituximab therapy </plain></SENT>
