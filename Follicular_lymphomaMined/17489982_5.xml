<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>GCET2 (Germinal centre B-cell expressed transcript 2; also named HGAL) is a newly cloned gene that has been shown to be a useful marker for germinal centre (GC) B cells and GC B-cell derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, including follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and germinal centre B cell-like diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333295" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">GCB-DLBCLs</z:e>), and is a useful prognosticator for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here the biochemical and biological properties of GCET2, which may help to determine its role in the GC reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GCET2 is constitutively localised in the plasma membrane but is excluded from <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GCET2 does not have a transmembrane domain, and its membrane localisation is mediated by myristoylation and palmitoylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GCET2 has five conserved putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites, and it can be phosphorylated following pervanadate treatment in B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By serially mutating the five tyrosines, the third and fourth tyrosines were found to be essential for GCET2 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GCET2 was phosphorylated when co-transfected into COS7 cells with protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) LYN, LCK or SYK, and therefore it could be a substrate of these kinases in B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The third tyrosine site ((107)YENV) of GCET2 is a consensus GRB2 binding site, and GCET2 was found to associate with GRB2 through the third tyrosine following phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggests that GCET2 may be an adaptor protein in GC B cells that transduces signals from GC B-cell membrane to the cytosol via its association with GRB2 </plain></SENT>
