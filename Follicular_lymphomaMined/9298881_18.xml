<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) for antigen receptor rearrangements have the potential to increase the detection of minimal degrees of marrow involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study is a concurrent morphologic and PCR evaluation of 225 staging or posttherapy marrow biopsies from 127 patients with B-lineage non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The biopsies were morphologically categorized into four groups: group 1 (positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), 60 biopsies (27%); group 2 (suspicious for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), 20 biopsies (9%); group 3 (lymphocytic lesions of indeterminate biology), 22 biopsies (10%); and group 4 (negative for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), 123 biopsies (54%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular studies were performed on concurrently obtained aspirates and used consensus immunoglobulin-heavy-chain (IgH) and IgH/bcl-2 gene PCR primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A molecular clone was detected in 53 of the 225 aspirates (24%): group 1, 34 aspirates (57%); group 2, five aspirates (25%); group 3, one aspirate (5%); and group 4, 13 aspirates (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A PCR-positive aspirate was present in 47% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 58% of diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and 72% of the other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in the group I specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>Morphology</z:mp> or PCR was positive in 79 of the 225 cases (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The molecular detection of clonality in the aspirate DNA from cases with positive morphologic findings was lower than anticipated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The discordance between <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and PCR results may be related to sample variation between the trephine biopsy and aspirate, a failure to aspirate sufficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, or insufficient primer homology for amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DNA extracted from trephine sections may provide results more concordant with <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, because PCR detected a clone in 10 of 11 DNA specimens extracted from trephine biopsies with positive morphologic findings and PCR negative aspirates </plain></SENT>
