<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated a fixed scheme of combination chemotherapy protocol including CHOP, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and rituximab (CHOP-GR) for patients with advanced-stage grade 1 or grade 2 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in a phase II clinical trial, assessing enhancement of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of rituximab by G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one untreated patients received two courses of CHOP chemotherapy followed by four courses of CHOP-GR, including G-CSF (s.c.) on days 11 - 14 and rituximab on day 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall response rate was 76% (16 of 21 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients, one with no response and subsequent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and one with progressive disease, died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient refused to continue therapy, whereas two were rediagnosed and no longer met histologic criteria; these three patients were classified as nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a median observation time of 23 months, the 19 histologically assessable patients showed a 2-year progression-free survival rate of 82%, whereas 2-year overall survival was 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (79%) continued in remission during this median follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of seven patients with initial bulky mass, five responded to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most frequent adverse events were <z:mp ids='MP_0000221'>leukocytopenia</z:mp> (100%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (100%), followed in turn by alopetia (94%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (79%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 11 patients examined for bcl-2 translocation in peripheral blood or marrow by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), four were positive, whereas three of the four had complete remissions and converted to PCR negativity after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>According to short-term observation, CHOP-GR is a safe and effective therapy for patients with advanced-stage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
