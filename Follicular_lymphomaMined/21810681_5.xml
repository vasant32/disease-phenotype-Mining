<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> added to rituximab, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (R-CVP) in previously untreated advanced-stage FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a phase II multicenter trial adding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> (1.3 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8) to standard-dose R-CVP (BR-CVP) for up to eight cycles in patients with newly diagnosed stage III/IV FL requiring therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two co-primary end points, complete response rate (complete response [CR]/CR unconfirmed [CRu]) and incidence of grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity, were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between December 2006 and March 2009, 94 patients were treated with BR-CVP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median patient age was 57 years (range, 29 to 84 years), and the majority had a high (47%) or intermediate (43%) Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BR-CVP was extremely well tolerated, with 90% of patients completing the intended eight cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patients developed grade 4 neurotoxicity, and only five of 94 patients (5%; 95% CI, 0.8% to 9.9%) developed grade 3 neurotoxicity, which was largely reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the basis of an intention-to-treat analysis, 46 of 94 patients (49%; 95% CI, 38.8% to 59.0%) achieved a CR/CRu, and 32 of 94 patients (34%) achieved a partial response, for an overall response rate of 83% (95% CI, 75.4% to 90.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> to standard-dose R-CVP for advanced-stage FL is feasible and well tolerated with minimal additional toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The complete response rate in this high-risk population compares favorably to historical results of patients receiving R-CVP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Given these results, a phase III trial comparing BR-CVP with R-CVP is planned </plain></SENT>
