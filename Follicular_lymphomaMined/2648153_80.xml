<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Approximately half the patients with diffuse or follicular large-cell or mixed large- and small-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> enter a prolonged remission or are cured after receiving combined-drug therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been unclear, however, why the other half do not respond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 54 previously untreated patients with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 20 with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had a large-cell component and Stage II through IV disease, subsequently treated with combined chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Different recurrent genomic defects were associated with differences in the response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 54 patients with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 patients with a duplication of chromosome 3p had a complete clinical remission after a median follow-up of 39 months (11 patients survived) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven patients with a duplication of chromosome 2p had a partial response or no response to treatment and a median survival of six months (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> died) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 20 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 patients with duplication 3p or +3 had a complete clinical remission (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> survived), and 3 of 4 patients with duplication 2p or +2 had no response or a partial response to treatment and died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients with B-cell non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who had a bcl-2 oncogene rearrangement had a poorer response to therapy (7 of 23 with complete remission) than the patients without bcl-2 rearrangement (21 of 26 with complete remission) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in large-cell or mixed-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, duplication of chromosome 3p is associated with a relatively good prognosis and duplication of chromosome 2p or bcl-2 oncogene rearrangement is associated with a relatively poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because such multiple recurrent genomic defects are also common in most other types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, they may have general prognostic importance </plain></SENT>
