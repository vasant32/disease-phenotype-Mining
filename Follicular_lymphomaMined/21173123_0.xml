<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of CD23 expression in FL is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the expression of CD23 by flow cytometry in 69 lymph nodes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e>) and correlated it with pathologic and clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 69 FLs, 48 (70%) were CD23+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 FLs were CD23- more often (12/16 [75%]) than grade 1 and 2 cases (9/53 [17%]; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD23 expression was more common in FLs in inguinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> than in other sites: 20 of 23 (87%) vs 28 of 46 (61%; P = .029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (P = .002) and event-free survival (P &lt; .0001) were longer in the CD23+ group than in the CD23- FLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study shows that grade 3 FLs are more often CD23- than lower grade FLs and that FLs in inguinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> are more frequently CD23+ than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> from other sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our findings also indicate that survival is significantly better in CD23+ FLs </plain></SENT>
