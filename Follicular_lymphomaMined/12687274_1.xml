<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients (pts) with low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Gianni et al (2000) assessed the ability of Rituximab, given in combination with high-dose chemotherapy, to eradicate PCR-detectable disease and enable the harvesting of large amounts of uncontaminated circulating progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study was conducted in 27 consecutive pts with untreated bcl2 positive NHL (follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>--7, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>--13 and NHL in leukemic phase--7), 14 pts received Rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received 4 courses of standard-dose chemotherapy (CHOP or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e>-CY), followed by one course of high-dose cyclophosphamid plus G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients allocated to Rituximab received i.v. infusions of 375 mg/m2 48 hours before stem cell collection and in 3 weekly doses after transplantation (R-CHT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical response after transplantation was evaluated in 26 pts who completed the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The complete response rate was in 100% in the Rituximab group (PCR negative in 79%) versus 50% of controls (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Yield of purged CD34+ cells was with median 5.23x10(6)/kg in CHT and 8.76x10(6)/kg in R-CHT pts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Toxicity in the both arms was acceptated (no difference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed between CHT and R-CHT group in the mean number of days spent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and trombocytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After a follow-up of 31 months, no patient relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Aside from providing PCR-negative harvests, the chemoimmunotherapy treatment produced complete clinical (100%) and molecular remission in 79% of evaluable pts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We showed that Rituximab in combination with effective high-dose anti- <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> chemotherapy, allowed the harvesting of large amounts of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> free progenitor cells in evaluable pts </plain></SENT>
