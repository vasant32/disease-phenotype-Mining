<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome contains an open reading frame, BHRF1, that encodes a presumptive membrane protein with sequence similarity to the proto-oncogene bcl2, which is linked to human B-cell follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Potential roles for BHRF1 in EBV's ability to growth transform human B cells and to replicate in B cells in culture were investigated by generating EBV mutants that lack most of the open reading frame </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was accomplished by recombination of plasmids carrying mutations in BHRF1 with the transformation-defective EBV strain P3HR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because BHRF1 resides close to the deletion in P3HR1 that renders this strain transformation defective, B-cell transformation could be used to select for recombination events in the region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>B-cell clones were established by recombinants which lacked most of the BHRF1 open reading frame, although most of these initial B-cell transformants also carried nonrecombinant (BHRF1+) P3HR1 genomes, at levels ranging from a fraction of a copy to four copies per cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary B-cell transformants that lacked BHRF1+ EBV at detectable levels were found to release transforming, BHRF1-deficient EBV at levels that were within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range for EBV-immortalized B-cell clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrate that BHRF1 is nonessential for growth transformation of B cells and for virus replication and release from these cells in culture </plain></SENT>
