<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to explore association between polymorphism G397C in the 5'-region of BCL6 and both incidence and progression of NHL in 154 NHL cases and 362 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neither frequencies of the rare BCL6 allele 397C nor particular genotypes differed significantly between NHL cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association of histological type of NHL and clinical characteristics with this polymorphism </plain></SENT>
