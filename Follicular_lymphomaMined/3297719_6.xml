<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated in the same way independent of the histological type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 468 patients in the study of whom 124 patients were in stage I (85% 5 year survival), 57 in stage II (55%), 121 in stage III (55%) and 166 in stage IV (45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the Kiel classification the low grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were subdivided into two categories: those with a follicular (80% 5 year survival) and with a diffuse cell pattern (50% 5 year survival) with an intermediate prognosis compared with the high grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (35% 5 year survival) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment was stratified according to stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In stage I regional radiotherapy was given followed by randomization for maintenance chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">Vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">Cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">Prednisone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No influence in survival was seen (85% at 5 years), although disease free survival was better in the maintenance chemotherapy group (75% vs 55% at 5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In stage II regional radiotherapy was followed, after randomization, by transdiaphragmatic irradiation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients received maintenance chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The group was too small to draw conclusions about the effect of this treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Primary radiotherapy in stage II disease with diffuse histology gave bad results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients in stage III and IV were treated with 8 courses of chemotherapy with Adriamycin, VM26, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">Cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">Prednisone</z:chebi>, given in two different time schedules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Iceberg radiation was then given to areas with initially large or slowly responding disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had maintenance chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No difference was found for the 2 chemotherapy schedules in remission rate, disease free interval and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In stage III and IV patients with a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> have a longer relapse free interval and total survival (39% and 68% at 5 years) compared with those with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diffuse histology (19 and 30% at 5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients with stage IV disease due to bone marrow involvement only had a better prognosis compared with stage IV disease for other reasons </plain></SENT>
