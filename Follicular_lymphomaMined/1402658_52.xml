<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The genesis of human follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is a multistep process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The initial event is thought to be the chromosomal translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21) juxtaposing the bcl-2 proto-oncogene with the immunoglobulin (Ig) H chain locus joining segment (JH) as an error of D-J or V-D joining in the pre-B cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, FL is recognized clinically as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> of surface Ig (sIg)-positive B cells with morphologic and phenotypic similarities to the centrocyte of the secondary immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, additional steps must be involved in the clonal expansion of the FL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell beyond the activation of bcl-2 as a consequence of the t(14;18) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Like the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> centrocyte, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> accumulate in the variable (V) genes of FL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine if clonal expansion of FL occurs before or after the development of the malignant follicle, we sought to examine the evolution of the FL V gene from its unmutated germline (GL) counterpart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To obtain the GL gene we first cloned the productively rearranged V gene of patient MT FL and obtained the clone rMTF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A hybridization probe derived from the 2.1-kb region upstream of the V gene in clone rMTF identified a single band in Southern blot hybridization of GL DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This probe was used to screen a size-selected library, and candidate GL V genes were isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two identical clones, MTGL1 and 2, proved to have upstream regions (USRs) that were colinear with the USR of the rMTF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the MTGL clones represent the unmutated GL V genes, which were productively rearranged in the MT FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the GL V gene sequence to a consensus of MT FL V gene sequences revealed 42 mutations, demonstrating that malignant clonal expansion occurred subsequent to the activation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo>, presumably in the malignant follicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the individual FL V gene sequences segregated into two distinct patterns of mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The major population represented 71% of the clones, and the minor population 29% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>To investigate possible mechanisms for the parallel selection of distinct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell populations, we analyzed the pattern of silent and replacement mutations within the V gene sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We found that in the framework regions (FRs) of both populations there were significantly fewer replacement changes than expected, suggesting that negative selective pressure was maintaining the structural integrity of the sIg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), which make up the antigen binding domain of Ig, had an excess of replacement changes, suggesting positive selection for altered ligand binding </plain></SENT>
