<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>So far, it has not been studied in primary cutaneous follicle center <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCFCLs</z:e>), which, compared with NFLs, express less frequently t(14;18)(q32;q21) and bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using real-time PCR we measured bcl-xL and bcl-2 gene expression levels in laser-microdissected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells of 20 PCFCL frozen sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Numbers of apoptotic cells labeled by TUNEL assay were negatively correlated with bcl-xL expression levels (r=-0.840, P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bcl-xL expression was significantly higher in biopsies of patients who developed relapse or disease progression later compared with patients who did not (P=0.022), and higher levels of bcl-xL gene expression were significantly correlated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (P=0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of these features was correlated with bcl-2 gene expression levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that bcl-xL overexpression is inversely correlated with PFS in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCFCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the inverse correlation between bcl-xL expression levels and apoptotic cell numbers suggests that bcl-xL, through its antiapoptotic effect, might contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCFCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
