<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Studies suggest that primary extranodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is not infrequent but it remains poorly characterized with variable histologic, molecular, and clinical outcome findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared 27 extranodal FL to 44 nodal FL using morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic techniques and evaluated the clinical outcome of these 2 similarly staged groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight cases of primary cutaneous follicle center <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In comparison to nodal FL, a greater number of extranodal FL contained a diffuse growth pattern (P=0.004) and lacked CD10 expression (P=0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four percent of extranodal and 42% of nodal FL cases showed evidence of t(14;18), with minor breakpoints (icr, 3'BCL2, 5'mcr) more commonly found in extranodal cases (P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcome data showed no significant differences in overall survival (P=0.565) and progression-free survival (P=0.627) among extranodal, nodal, and primary cutaneous follicle center <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases by t(14;18) status indicate that the translocation-negative group is characterized by a diffuse growth pattern (P=0.043) and lower BCL2 expression (P=0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18)-positive group showed significantly better overall survival (P=0.019) and disease-specific survival (P=0.006) in comparison with the t(14;18)-negative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In low stage FL, the status of t(14;18) seems to be more predictive of outcome than origin from an extranodal versus nodal site </plain></SENT>
