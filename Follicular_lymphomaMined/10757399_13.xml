<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Progression of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to a higher-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> frequently heralds a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical transformation is variably accompanied by a spectrum of histologic changes characterized by alteration in growth and cytology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although several cytogenetic events and potential oncogenes have been documented in this progression, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present five patients with an unusual histologic transformation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> manifested by blastic/blastoid <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This transformation is histologically distinct from other types of transformation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five cases exhibited the t(14;18) translocation and expressed the BCL-2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, two of the five patients showed increased levels of the p53 protein within neoplastic cells implicating a possible role for this oncogene in blastic/blastoid transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lack of BCL-1 and myeloid antigens by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry studies served to distinguish blastic/blastoid transformation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from its morphologic mimics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This distinction is clinically important because lymphoblastic and myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> require significantly different therapeutic modalities and show better prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the lack of Epstein-Barr virus-specific <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> suggests that this virus is unlikely to participate in blastic/blastoid transformation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
