<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One FL with a high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> load and intraclonal V(H) gene diversity was investigated in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>V(H) gene transcripts were amplified and sequenced from samples of approximately 50 tumor cells isolated from frozen tissue sections by laser microdissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the mutation pattern of the prevalent subclone in the relapse biopsy was virtually identical to that of a subclone isolated by microdissection from the presentation biopsy 9 years earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a second FL, proof was obtained that the subclone that dominated the relapse sample had already been present in the initial biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The finding that subclones found in the relapses of these FLs had not evolved over time but were preexistent, challenges the concept of antigen-driven B-cell receptor evolution during disease course </plain></SENT>
