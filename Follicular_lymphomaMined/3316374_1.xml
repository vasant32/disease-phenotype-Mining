<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied an unusual type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the ileocecal region using an established protocol that combines morphologic, flow cytometric, and immunohistochemical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grew as multiple submucosal nodules, some of which had coalesced into a mass in the terminal ileum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the lesion resembled a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of follicular center-cell origin except for germinal centers that appeared reactive and greatly expanded follicular mantles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric studies showed that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> contained a monoclonal, kappa+ population of B-lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of sections of frozen tissue by an immunoperoxidase technique revealed that the germinal centers were polyclonal (nonneoplastic) and that the neoplastic cells were confined to the mantle zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The additional information led to classification of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> as the mantle zone variant of intermediate lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> may pursue a more aggressive course than a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> derived from the germinal center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We review our general approach to the analysis of hematolymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and discuss how certain techniques may be useful adjuncts in the evaluation of these types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
