<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A translocation involving the bcl-2 gene on chromosome 18 and the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene on chromosome 14 is frequently found in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and is believed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, bcl-2/IgH rearrangements have been detected in reactive lymphoid tissue obtained from European patients, indicating that such rearrangements occur at some low but measurable background rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In non-malignant tissues, the polymerase chain reaction was used to study the frequency of bcl-2/IgH rearrangements in reactive lymphoid tissue obtained from American and Japanese patients to find out whether geographic variation in the incidence of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was caused by differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> occurrence of the t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found such rearrangements in 5 of 15 American hyperplastic tonsils and lymph nodes and 5 of 10 Japanese tonsils, an incidence close to that previously seen in European patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the background incidence of such rearrangements is similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> populations, regardless of the incidence of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
