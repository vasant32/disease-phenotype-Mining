<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms involving the in vitro effect of rituximab in cells from 55 patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No cytotoxic effect was observed when cells were incubated with rituximab alone, but in the presence of human AB serum rituximab induced complement-dependent cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (R-CDC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A cytotoxic effect was observed in cells from 9 of 33 patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, 16 of 16 patients with mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 4 of 4 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 2 of 2 patients with hairy-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>R-CDC was observed in cells from patients expressing more than 50 x 10(3) CD20 molecules per cell, and directly correlated with the number of CD20 molecules per cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preincubation with anti-CD59 increased the cytotoxic effect of rituximab and sensitized cells from nonsensitive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither cleavage of poly-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi> polymerase (PARP) nor activation of caspase-3 was observed in R-CDC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, no cells with a hypodiploid DNA content were detected and R-CDC was not prevented by a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, suggesting a caspase-independent mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incubation with rituximab in the presence of AB serum induced a rapid and intense production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>R-CDC was blocked by the incubation of cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetyl-L-cysteine</z:chebi> (NAC) or Tiron, 2 ROS scavengers, indicating that the cytotoxic effect was due to the generation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> (O) radicals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that CD20, CD59, and complement have a role in the in vitro cytotoxic effect of rituximab, which is mediated by a caspase-independent process that involves ROS generation </plain></SENT>
