<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Variables used to build up the International Index for aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (age, performance status, stage, extranodal involvement, and lactic dehydrogenase [LDH]) are also important in low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the prognostic value of this index in low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we have applied it to a series of 125 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-five patients with low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who were diagnosed at a single institution over a 20-year period and treated with standard chemotherapy were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>End points of the study were response to therapy and survival according to the International Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to the International Index, main initial and evolutive variables were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate methods were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After applying the International Index, the patients divided into four risk groups: low (36% of cases), low-intermediate (32%), high-intermediate (20.8%), and high (11.2%), with complete response (CR) rates in the four groups being 60%, 35%, 23%, and 21%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten-year overall survival rates for the risk groups were as follows: low, 73.6%; low-intermediate, 45.2%; high-intermediate, 53.5%; and high, 0% (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When the International Index was included in a multivariate analysis, along with the main initial variables, International Index (P &lt; .001) and sex (male, worse) (P = .038) were the only parameters related to survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When response to therapy was also included, achievement of CR (P &lt; .0001) and International Index (P &lt; .001) were the most important factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients who achieved a CR, the International Index was the only parameter related to survival (P = .051) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results were the same when the International Index was applied to the subset of 107 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study, the International Index has been found to be an important prognostic tool in low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Such an index could be used to predict prognosis not only in aggressive, but also in low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
