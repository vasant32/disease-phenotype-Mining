<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro, they can be expanded and kill efficiently a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency and distribution of gammadelta T lymphocytes were compared in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> lymph nodes of 51 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lymph nodes (FL-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e>) and 28 patients with inflammatory lymph nodes (I-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e>). gammadelta and CD8 T lymphocytes were less abundant in FL-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> than in I-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> (p &lt;or= 10(-7)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These lymphocytes were localized in the perifollicular zone outside of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perifollicular gammadelta T lymphocytes expressed CCR7, in contrast to peripheral blood gammadelta T lymphocytes and both perifollicular and peripheral blood gammadelta T lymphocytes expressed CXCR4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The very low number of perifollicular gammadelta T lymphocytes in FL-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> could be explained in part by migratory problems because of absence of CCL19 expression in FL-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> compared with I-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, CCL21 and CXCL12 were similarly expressed in both FL-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> and I-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CCL19 and CCL21 were expressed in high endothelial venules and lymphatic vessels, whereas CXCL12 was expressed by stromal cells surrounding high endothelial venules and lymphatic vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Peripheral gammadelta T lymphocytes from 34 patients with FL, expanded with Phosphostim and IL-2 in vitro, had the same expansion capacity as those from healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, gammadelta T lymphocytes can be an attractive source for adoptive immunotherapy in patients with FL, providing they may home in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
