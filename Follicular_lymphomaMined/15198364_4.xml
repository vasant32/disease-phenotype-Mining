<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is considerable literature on FNA evaluation of primary pancreatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, but few studies address the FNA diagnosis of primary pancreatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed 14 cases of atypical lymphoid processes diagnosed by FNA during a 5-year period, constituting 1.3% of a total of 1,050 pancreatic FNA cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses were as follows: 6 large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 4 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 3 suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 1 unclassified B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> manifested in older people (mean age, 64.7 years) as a solitary mass in the pancreatic head, mimicking primary <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clonality was confirmed by flow cytometry in 11 cases and immunohistochemical analysis on cell block material in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Obtaining diagnostic material often required several passes (average, 3.9 passes; range, 1-8 passes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that primary pancreatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> rarely are diagnosed by FNA, tend to be high grade, and clinically and radiographically might mimic primary <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
