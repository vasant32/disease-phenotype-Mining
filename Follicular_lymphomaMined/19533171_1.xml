<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of family history on survival in NHL has not been examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the Swedish Family-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Database to estimate hazard ratios in NHL by histology and family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> as reference (HR 1.0), patients with Waldenstr√∂m's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024419" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">macroglobulinemia</z:e> and hairy-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> had the best survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival advantage was also noted among patients with lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and different kinds of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mycosis fungoides</z:e> showed a favorable prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As for survival by family history, a total of 98 familial cases were noted in our Database with a similar prognosis compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases in both parental and offspring generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A non-significant familial concordance of either good or poor survival was noted among family members when probands' prognosis was stratified by survival time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide quantitative prognosis data for patients with NHL according to specific histologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with a familial NHL had a similar prognosis compared to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The data suggest familial concordance in either good or poor survival among family members </plain></SENT>
