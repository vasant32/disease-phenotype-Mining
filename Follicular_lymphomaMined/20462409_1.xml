<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is an important marker for one of the 'two-hits' required for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Traditional methods for mapping LOH regions require the comparison of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and patient-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> DNA samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, for many archival samples, patient-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> DNA is not available leading to the under-utilization of this important resource in LOH studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a new method for LOH analysis that relies on the genome-wide comparison of heterozygosity of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between cohorts of cases and un-matched healthy control samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regions of LOH are defined by consistent decreases in heterozygosity across a genetic region in the case cohort compared to the control cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DNA was collected from 20 Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples, 20 Diffuse Large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples, neoplastic B-cells of 10 B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</z:hpo> (B-CLL) patients and Buccal cell samples matched to 4 of these B-CLL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cohort heterozygosity comparison method was developed and validated using LOH derived in a small cohort of B-CLL by traditional comparisons of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> DNA samples, and compared to the only alternative method for LOH analysis without patient matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LOH candidate regions were then generated for enlarged cohorts of B-CLL, FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> samples using our cohort heterozygosity comparison method in order to evaluate potential LOH candidate regions in these non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using a small cohort of B-CLL samples with patient-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> DNA we have validated the utility of this method and shown that it displays more accuracy and sensitivity in detecting LOH candidate regions compared to the only alternative method, the Hidden Markov Model (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="24564">HMM</z:chebi>) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, using B-CLL, FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples we have utilised cohort heterozygosity comparisons to localise LOH candidate regions in these subtypes of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Detected LOH regions included both previously described regions of LOH as well as novel genomic candidate regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have proven the efficacy of the use of cohort heterozygosity comparisons for genome-wide mapping of LOH and shown it to be in many ways superior to the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="24564">HMM</z:chebi> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the use of this method to analyse SNP microarray data from 3 common forms of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> yielded interesting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene candidates, including the ETV3 gene that was highlighted in both B-CLL and FL </plain></SENT>
