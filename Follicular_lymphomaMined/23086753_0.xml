<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we evaluated the relative frequencies of NHL subtypes in Central and South America (CSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five expert hematopathologists classified consecutive cases of NHL from 5 CSA countries using the WHO classification and compared them to 400 cases from North America (NA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 1028 CSA cases, the proportions of B- and T-cell NHL and the sex distribution were similar to NA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the median age of B-cell NHL in CSA (59 years) was significantly lower than in NA (66 years; P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distribution of high-grade (52.9%) and low-grade (47.1%) mature B-cell NHL in CSA was also significantly different from NA (37.5% and 62.5%; P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was more common in CSA (40%) than in NA (29.2%; P &lt; .0001), whereas the frequency of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was similar in Argentina (34.1%) and NA (33.8%), and higher than the rest of CSA (17%; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extranodal NK/T-cell NHL was also more common in CSA (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study provides new objective evidence that the distribution of NHL subtypes varies significantly by geographic region and should prompt epidemiologic studies to explain these differences </plain></SENT>
