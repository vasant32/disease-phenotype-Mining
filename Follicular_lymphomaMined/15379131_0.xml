<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four hundred consecutive untreated patients with NHL were diagnosed according to the WHO classification between January 2000 and October 2003 in the Regional Bureau of Pathology, St-Petersburg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients' age, gender, location of the biopsied <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> focus were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemical study was performed by the paraffin section-immunoperoxidase method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases of plasma cell <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> and bone marrow trephine biopsy diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were excluded, the rest series of 377 cases was compared to other regional world series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> accounted for 79.6% and T-cell type for 20.4% of 377 NHL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>33.2% cases were different histological variants of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 17.0% were B-cell small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 11.0%--follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 4.5%--mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 2.1%--extranodal marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (MALT-type), 1.9%--primary B-cell mediastinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, unspecified and anaplastic large T/null cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were diagnosed in 6.4 and 4.2% of 377 cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnoses comprised 19.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and B-cell small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are prevalent among B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are less common in the North-West of Russia compared to Europe and USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The relative frequency of extranodal marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (MALT-type) is lower and anaplastic large T/null cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is higher than these in International <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Study Group, Taiwan and Japan series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study provides evidence that the distribution pattern of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes in the North-West of Russia shows significant differences with those from the rest of the world </plain></SENT>
