<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We estimated the total direct medical costs, cumulative survival, and cost-effectiveness of adding rituximab to first-line chemotherapy for FL, based on a single source of data representing routine practice in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) registry data plus Medicare claims, we identified 1,117 FL patients who received first-line CHOP (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (C), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> (V), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (P)) or CVP +/- rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression was used to estimate adjusted cumulative cost and survival differences between the two groups over four years after beginning treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age was 73 years (minimum 66 years), 56% had stage III-IV disease, and 67% received rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adding rituximab to first-line chemotherapy was associated with higher adjusted incremental total cost ($18,695; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) $9,302-$28,643) and longer adjusted cumulative survival (0.18 years; 95% CI 0.10-0.27) over four years of followup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expected cost-effectiveness was $102,142 (95% CI $34,531-296,337) per life-year gained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In routine clinical practice, adding rituximab to first-line chemotherapy for elderly patients with FL results in higher direct medical costs to Medicare and longer cumulative survival after four years </plain></SENT>
