<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regulatory T-cells (Treg) play an emerging role in the prognosis of non-Hodgkin B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and mediate significant autoreactive T-cell suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we demonstrate that numbers of Treg are significantly decreased in AITL lymph nodes [n = 30, 91 (40-195) per high power fields] compared with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> [n = 19, 179 (86-355)] and reactive lymph nodes [n = 8, 186 (140-265)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the few Treg in lymph nodes of AITL are resting Treg (rTreg) and have a naive CD45RA+, PD1-, and ICOS- phenotype [n = 5, 57% of Treg are CD45RA+ (16-96)], in contrast to the Treg in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> [n = 5, 7.4% (1-13)] or reactive lymph nodes [n = 7, 18.6% (6-48)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Treg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> was not observed in AITL peripheral blood at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Altogether, these data suggest that Treg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> could contribute to the nodal neoplastic T(FH) expansion and dysimmune symptoms in AITL </plain></SENT>
