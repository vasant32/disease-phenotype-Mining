<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that innate immunity polymorphisms may be associated with NHL risk, we genotyped 144 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) capturing common genetic variation within 12 innate immunity gene regions in three independent population-based case-control studies (1946 cases and 1808 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gene-based analyses found IL1RN to be associated with NHL risk (minP = 0·03); specifically, IL1RN rs2637988 was associated with an increased risk of NHL (per-allele odds ratio = 1·15, 95% confidence interval = 1·05-1·27; P(trend) = 0·003), which was consistent across study, subtype, and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FCGR2A was also associated with a decreased risk of the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> NHL subtype (minP = 0·03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that genetic variation in IL1RN and FCGR2A may play a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Given that conflicting results have been reported regarding the association between IL1RN SNPs and NHL risk, a larger number of innate immunity genes with sufficient genomic coverage should be evaluated systematically across many studies </plain></SENT>
