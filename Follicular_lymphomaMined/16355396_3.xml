<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> cytology (FNAC) is a well-established technique for diagnosis of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ML) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Generally, Giemsa but not Pap stain is used in FNAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, cytologic features obtained from Pap stain are also valuable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Very few studies on the cytologic characteristics of ML, as determined by Pap stain, are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is easier to observe nuclear irregularity and to identify nucleoli in ML cells by Pap stain than by Giemsa stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we applied Pap stain for cytomorphologic differential diagnosis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) from reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> (RFH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen biopsy-confirmed cases of FL grades 1 and 2, with available FNAC smears, and six cases of RFH were selected for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low-power magnification showed well-known features, and tingible body macrophages and lymphoid cell aggregates were observed frequently in RFH and FL, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the so-called two-nuclei-like cleaved cells were observed frequently in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These cells showed notably cleaved nuclei, and therefore, appeared to possess two nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Under high-power magnification, the occurrence of cells with nucleoli &gt;1 microm and of cleaved cells was high in FL compared to RFH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is believed that FL derives from centrocytes and that FL cells are slightly larger than non-neoplastic small lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, analysis of cell diameter in this study indicated that small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were predominant in half the cases of FL grades 1 and 2, and the percentage of these cells was similar to that in RFH, showing why false-negative diagnosis of FL grades 1 and 2 occasionally occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There are limitations of FNAC in the diagnosis of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, we believe that the appearance of two-nuclei-like cleaved cells and the high percentage of nucleoli-possessing cells, which we describe here, provide significant and valuable clues for the differential diagnosis of FL from RFH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Of 18 cases of FL grades 1 and 2, t(14;18)(q32;q21) was found in 13 cases with the use of destained FNAC smears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that, together with the cytomorphologic findings described earlier, FISH analysis for the chromosomal translocation, t(14;18)(q32;q21), is crucial for final cytologic diagnosis of FL grades 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
