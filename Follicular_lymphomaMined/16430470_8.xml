<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate whether an antibody against an intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> can detect CD19 in routine biopsy specimens and thus to document in detail its expression in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD AND RESULTS: A polyclonal antibody to the C terminus of CD19 was used to immunostain paraffin-embedded samples of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD19 was widely expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells and in extramedullary plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was found in most B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, but expression in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was weak (33/69) or negative (four cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, CD19 expression in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was weak (28/56) or negative (eight cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In T-cell-rich B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, CD19 was also weak (4/10) or negative (three cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD19 was often absent in post-transplant B <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e>, classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and plasma cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An unexpected finding was the frequent absence of CD19 in the neoplastic cells in lymphocyte predominant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CD19 can now be detected in routine biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the classical pan-B marker CD20, CD19 is not always strongly expressed in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&amp;H) cells of lymphocyte predominant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (which express most B-cell-associated markers) commonly lack CD19 </plain></SENT>
