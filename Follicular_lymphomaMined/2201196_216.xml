<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been reported previously that the bcl-2 protooncogene protein is detectable in neoplastic cells from cases of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in which the 14;18 chromosomal translocation is present, but not in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that lack this chromosomal rearrangement or in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we confirmed, by immunohistologic labeling with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, that bcl-2 protein is strongly expressed in many cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and that these neoplastic follicles differ clearly from their nonmalignant counterpart (reactive germinal centres) in which bcl-2 protein is undetectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However we also found bcl-2 protein in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T- and B-lymphoid cells and in a variety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> in which the 14;18 translocation is not present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is therefore concluded that expression of bcl-2 protein is not a specific marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> bearing the 14;18 chromosomal translocation and that the observations of other investigators may have reflected the inadequate sensitivity of their staining procedure </plain></SENT>
