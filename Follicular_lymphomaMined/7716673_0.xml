<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To analyse the initial and evolutive characteristics of the patients with low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and long survival (&gt; or = 12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The initial data (clinical, laboratory, histologic type, stage) and the clinical course (response to therapy, response duration) of 52 patients with low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosed before 1980 were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The statistical study was carried out by means of the chi-square test with Yates' correction and Student's t; the actuarial survival was estimated, and the duration of remission was assessed by the Kaplan and Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Curves were compared by the log rank method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 12-year survival as a whole was 32% (CI: 95%: 18.5%-45.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 52 patients, 13 (25%) survived over 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine were men and 4 women, with median age of 41 years (range: 22-68 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three cases had lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 10 had follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; 2 were in stage I-II and 11 in stage III-IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Those patients who would become long-survivors had at diagnosis lesser frequency of spread lymph-node regional involvement (&gt; or = 3 sites): 46% vs 81.8%, p = 0.04, as well as lesser percentage of bone-marrow involvement (38.4% vs 78.1%, p = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They were also better responders to treatment (CR+PR = 100% vs 71%, p = 0.013) and with longer duration (actuarial median duration of response 8 years vs 1.5 years, p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: According to the present analysis, low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients who have at diagnosis low tumoral involvement (not too extensive lymph-node involvement, disease-free bone-marrow) and show good response to treatment have a better prognosis and may hope for a longer survival </plain></SENT>
