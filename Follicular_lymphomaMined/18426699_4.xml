<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Estimate whether maintenance treatment with rituximab is a cost-effective intervention compared to the clinical practice of "observing" its evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Population: the EORTC 20981 clinical trial population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Perspective: Spanish National Health System (direct healthcare costs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis, with a transition model between states of health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Main variables: cost of gaining a quality-adjusted life year (QALY), per life year gained (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e>) and per progression-free <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Premises of the basic case: Weibull distribution for survival extrapolation, 5 year duration of the benefits of the treatment, time horizon of 10 years and annual discount rate (costs and benefits) of 3.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These premises were modified in the sensitivity analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Deterministic analysis: the cost per QALY gained was 9,358 euro, 8,493 euro per <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e> and 5,485 euro per progression-free <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Probabilistic and sensitivity analysis: they confirmed the stability of the deterministic analysis results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: According to this model, maintenance treatment with rituximab is cost-effective (cost per <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e> &lt; 30,000 euro) in patients with resistant or recurrent follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> responding to induction treatment, in comparison to the usual practice of observing patients' evolution </plain></SENT>
