<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In recent years, primary gastrointestinal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has been increasingly detected in the duodenum on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Primary gastrointestinal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are frequently distributed to multiple sites in the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, investigation into the spread of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in the small bowel is important in order to determine the most appropriate treatment strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The performance of double-balloon endoscopy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBE</z:chebi>) in the diagnosis of jejunoileal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lesions has not been fully evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the value of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBE</z:chebi> in addition to computed tomography (CT) and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET) in the diagnosis of jejunoileal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBE</z:chebi> with biopsy was performed in seven patients with primary duodenal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosed by EGD, in order to investigate jejunoileal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Jejunoileal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lesions were detected by <z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBE</z:chebi> in six out of the seven patients (three in the jejunum and three in the jejunum and ileum), whereas CT and (18)F-FDG-PET failed to detect the existence of these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic findings of the jejunoileal lesions revealed multiple white nodules and white villi, which were similar to those of <z:mp ids='MP_0002580'>duodenal lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBE</z:chebi> was more useful for the diagnosis of jejunoileal involvement in primary intestinal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> than CT and (18)F-FDG-PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The use of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBE</z:chebi> will become important for determining the most appropriate treatment for gastrointestinal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
