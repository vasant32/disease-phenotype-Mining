<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The presence of cytotoxic cells and their activation status were analyzed in tissue sections of 26 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To this end, expression of the perforin and granzyme B genes was studied by in situ hybridization experiments, and expression of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>-1 antigen was analyzed by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells expressing the granzyme B gene and the perforin gene were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their density was, however, highly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> from case to case, ranging from 160 to 7,040 positive cells/cm2 of tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>-1-positive cells were also evidenced in the 10 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cytotoxic cells were located in interfollicular areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Double labeling immunochemical experiments showed that most cytotoxic cells belonged to the CD8+ T lymphocyte population, although few CD4+ T lymphocytes and CD56+ natural killer cells also expressed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>-1 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings show that development of a malignant B lymphocyte proliferation is associated with a host-derived immune response involving intratumoral cytotoxic T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies comparing the density of such cells with the final outcome are required to determine whether the intensity of this immune response has a prognostic value </plain></SENT>
