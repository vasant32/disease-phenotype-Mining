<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term costs and cost effectiveness of rituximab maintenance therapy after induction therapy versus current standard practice (observation) from the French National Health Service perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A lifetime transition model was developed comparing rituximab maintenance with observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PFS and OS were obtained from the EORTC 20981 trial with a median follow-up of 28 months and extrapolated from 2-year Kaplan-Meier curves using a Weibull distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PFS and OS benefits of rituximab were conservatively assumed to last only 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Utility data were obtained from a multicentre observational study using the EQ-5D questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Direct medical costs were obtained from French official sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> costs are reported in euro, year 2006 values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The EORTC 20981 study demonstrated that rituximab maintenance was effective in the management of relapsed/refractory FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The model results showed that life expectancy and QALYs were increased by 22% and 28%, respectively, in patients treated with rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were euro 7612 per life-year gained and euro 8729 per QALY gained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a one-way sensitivity analysis, most of the ICERs fell within the range of euro 7000-12,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results tend to show that rituximab maintenance therapy may be a cost-effective strategy in the management of relapsed/refractory FL in France, with ICERs below those observed for other therapies in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The cost of rituximab was partly offset by the lower cost of relapse due to a longer time in the disease-free health state for patients in the rituximab arm </plain></SENT>
