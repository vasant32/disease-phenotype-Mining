<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To learn the time trend of FL in the Osaka area, an adult T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ATL) nonendemic area of Japan, we examined the frequency of FL among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHLs) during the period 1964 to 1987 (n = 1,000) and 1999 to 2001 (n = 659) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of FL with varying follicular areas increased from 1964-1987 to 1999-2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in frequency of total cases of FL (14.2% versus 18.8%) (P &lt; .05) and FL with no to 25% follicular area (2.3% versus 5.0%) (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to the Berard criteria, cytologic grade of FL was defined by counting the number of centroblasts (CB) in 10 neoplastic follicles as follow: &lt; or = 5 CB per high power field (HPF), grade 1; 6-15 CB, grade 2; &gt;15 CB, grade 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining with monoclonal antibodies for bcl-2 and CD10 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was an inverse correlation between follicular area and cytological grade (P &lt; .0001) and bcl-2 expression and cytological grade (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>That is, the larger the follicular area in cases with a lower cytological grade, the stronger was bcl-2 expression in a lower cytological grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between follicular area and stage of disease (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>That is, the follicular area was larger in cases in an advanced stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study showed the increase in frequency of FL in Osaka, Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Change of lifestyle in Japan may be one of the causative factors for the increase </plain></SENT>
