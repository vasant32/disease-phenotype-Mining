<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The revised World Health Organization (WHO) classification maintains a histological grading system (grades 1-3) for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) and subdivides grade 3 into 3A (FL3A) and 3B (FL3B) subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Optimal therapy of FL grade 3 and its potential curability with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy remain uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We carried out a retrospective population-based analysis evaluating the clinical characteristics and outcome of FL3A and FL3B as strictly defined by WHO diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the BC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Agency Lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Database, 161 patients with FL grade 3 were identified and, following detailed pathology review, composed of 139 with FL3A and 22 with FL3B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with FL3B had a higher overall International Prognostic Index (IPI) score than FL3A patients (P = 0.03), though no significant difference in individual IPI risk factor frequencies was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More patients with FL3B received front-line <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-containing chemotherapy (82% versus 36%, P â‰¤ 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With median follow-up of 45 months, no difference in disease-specific survival (P = 0.74) or overall survival (OS) (P = 0.87) was found between FL3A and FL3B and no survival curve plateau was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis limited to FL3A patients showed no OS advantage with front-line <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> use (P = 0.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Using strict diagnostic criteria, there appears to be no difference in outcome between patients with FL3A and FL3B and no evidence of curability with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based therapy </plain></SENT>
