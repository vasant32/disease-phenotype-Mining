<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Vaccination with hybridoma-derived autologous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> immunoglobulin (Ig) idiotype (Id) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and administered with granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induces follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) -specific immune responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the clinical benefit of this vaccine, we conducted a double-blind multicenter controlled phase III trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Treatment-naive patients with advanced stage FL achieving complete response (CR) or CR unconfirmed (CRu) after chemotherapy were randomly assigned two to one to receive either Id vaccine (Id-KLH + GM-CSF) or control (KLH + GM-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary efficacy end points were disease-free survival (DFS) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> randomly assigned patients and DFS for randomly assigned patients receiving at least one dose of Id vaccine or control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 234 patients enrolled, 177 (81%) achieved CR/CRu after chemotherapy and were randomly assigned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For 177 randomly assigned patients, including 60 patients not vaccinated because of relapse (n = 55) or other reasons (n = 5), median DFS between Id-vaccine and control arms was 23.0 versus 20.6 months, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.16; P = .256) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For 117 patients who received Id vaccine (n = 76) or control (n = 41), median DFS after randomization was 44.2 months for Id-vaccine arm versus 30.6 months for control arm (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.99; P = .047) at median follow-up of 56.6 months (range, 12.6 to 89.3 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In an unplanned subgroup analysis, median DFS was significantly prolonged for patients receiving IgM-Id (52.9 v 28.7 months; P = .001) but not IgG-Id vaccine (35.1 v 32.4 months; P = .807) compared with isotype-matched control-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Vaccination with patient-specific hybridoma-derived Id vaccine after chemotherapy-induced CR/CRu may prolong DFS in patients with FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vaccine isotype may affect clinical outcome and explain differing results between this and other controlled Id-vaccine trials </plain></SENT>
