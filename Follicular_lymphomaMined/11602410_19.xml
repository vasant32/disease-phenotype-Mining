<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Recently, a chimeric monoclonal antibody (MoAb) directed against the CD20 antigen (rituximab) has been successfully introduced in the treatment of several CD20-positive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> and particularly of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on these premises we evaluated the efficacy and the toxicity of chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) in relapsed/progressed hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (HCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten patients with relapsed/progressed HCL entered the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight patients were males and two females with a median age of 55 years (range 41-78) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them had been previously treated with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine and/or deoxycoformycin and a-interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two out of 10 patients were anemic (Hb &lt; 10 g/dL), 4 thrombocytopenic (Plt &lt; 100 x 10(9)/L), 3 had fewer than 1.0 x 10(9)/L neutrophils and 3 had circulating hairy cells (HC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received 375 mg/m2 i.v. of anti-CD20 MoAb once a week for 4 doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were evaluable for response, one patient showing a complete remission and 4 a partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adverse reactions, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, chills, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002653'>bone pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, were transient and mild (grade 1-2) and occurred only during the first course of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One month after the last infusion, patients who had had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, recovered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Circulating HC also disappeared within one month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunostained bone marrow biopsies were checked 1, 3 and 6 months after the end of therapy and in 5 out of 10 patients a &gt;50% reduction of bone marrow HC infiltration was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these preliminary results observed in 10 patients with progressed HCL, it appears that treatment with anti-CD20 MoAb is safe and effective in at least 50% of patients, particularly in those with a less evident bone marrow infiltration (50%) and in those previously splenectomized </plain></SENT>
