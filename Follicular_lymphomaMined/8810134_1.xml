<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, some follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> undergo histological transformation into higher grade malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently encountered a diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> which seemed to have progressed from a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and which finally transformed into a small non-cleaved <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each stage of the histological transformation was accompanied by increasing clinical grades of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was suspected that in our patient a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> initially developed due to rearrangement of the BCL2 gene, and then underwent histological transformation into a diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which was associated with p53 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequent rearrangement of C-MYC promoted the histological transformation of this diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> into a small non-cleaved <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that p53 mutation and rearrangement of C-MYC are involved in the histological transformation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> into more advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
