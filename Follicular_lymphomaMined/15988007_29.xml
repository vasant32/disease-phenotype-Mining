<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2 Mbr assumes a non-B DNA conformation, thus explaining its distinctive fragility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This non-B DNA structure is a target of the RAG complex in vivo, but not because of its primary sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we report that the RAG complex generates at least two independent nicks that lead to double-strand breaks in vitro, and this requires the non-B DNA structure at the bcl-2 Mbr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 3-bp mutation is capable of abolishing the non-B structure formation and the double-strand breaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The observations on the bcl-2 Mbr reflect more general properties of the RAG complex, which can bind and nick at duplex-single-strand transitions of other non-B DNA structures, resulting in double-strand breaks in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hence, the present study reveals novel insight into a third mechanism of action of RAGs on DNA, besides the standard heptamer/nonamer-mediated cleavage in V(D)J recombination and the in vitro transposase activity </plain></SENT>
