<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Suspicious of a subcutaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_404'>soft tissue tumor</z:mpath>, we performed a biopsy, and histological examination of the lesion indicated malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade 2) </plain></SENT>
