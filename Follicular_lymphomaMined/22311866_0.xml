<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we describe the design and development of a multitiered content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system for microscopic images utilizing a reference database that contains images of more than one disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proposed CBIR system uses a multitiered approach to classify and retrieve microscopic images involving their specific subtypes, which are mostly difficult to discriminate and classify </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This system enables both multi-image query and slide-level image retrieval in order to protect the semantic consistency among the retrieved images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>New weighting terms, inspired from information retrieval theory, are defined for multiple-image query and retrieval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The performance of the system was tested on a dataset including 1666 imaged high power fields extracted from 57 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) tissue slides with three subtypes and 44 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> (NB) tissue slides with four subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each slide is semantically annotated according to their subtypes by expert pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By using leave-one-slide out testing scheme, the multi-image query algorithm with the proposed weighting strategy achieves about 93% and 86% of average classification accuracy at the first rank retrieval, outperforming the image-level retrieval accuracy by about 38 and 26 percentage points, for FL and NB diseases, respectively </plain></SENT>
