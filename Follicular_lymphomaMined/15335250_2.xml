<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 73-year-old man who presented with a 2- to 3-month history of epigastric discomfort and guaiac-positive stool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a diffuse erythematous nodular mucosa and submucosal thickening in the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffuse mucosal nodularity was also found in the second portion of the duodenum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A complete workup with histologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular studies revealed 2 distinct, apparently unrelated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, namely, a gastric marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type) in a background of Helicobacter pylori <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> and a grade 1/3 duodenal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient was then treated with an H pylori eradication regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No therapy was given for his duodenal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> because his symptoms were thought to be due to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastric disease</z:e> and because the duodenal lesion was small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 6-month follow-up with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed only focal biopsy <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> in the stomach and an apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> duodenum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The follow-up biopsies revealed significant regression of his mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but persistence of his duodenal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combination of these 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in the same patient and the different clinical responses to antibiotic treatment make this case unique </plain></SENT>
