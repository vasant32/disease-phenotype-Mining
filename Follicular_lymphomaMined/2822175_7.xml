<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A novel cell line, FL-18, was established from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo> of a patient with follicular small cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the same time, an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen (EBNA)-positive cell line, FL-18-EB, was established from the EBV-infected culture of the same <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both cell lines had the same monoclonal surface immunoglobulin (IgG kappa), and they had the same karyotype as that of the fresh <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo> cells in which a reciprocal translocation between the long arm of chromosomes 14 and 18 [t(14;18)(q32;q21)] was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gene rearrangement analysis of immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene (JH) and kappa light-chain gene (J kappa) showed the same rearranged configuration in the two cell lines; however, some morphological and phenotypic differences were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The FL-18-EB cells, which were morphologically similar to common EBNA-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cell origin at the initial phase of culture, were larger than the FL-18 cells and contained multinucleated giant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The FL-18 cells lacked cytoplasmic immunoglobulin and were positive for common <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> antigen (CALLA), whereas the FL-18-EB cells had cytoplasmic immunoglobulin and were negative for CALLA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the phenotype of FL-18-EB seems to be a result of a shift by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> to a more mature stage in the B cell differentiation pathway than that of FL-18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The paired availability of EBV-free and EBV-infected cell lines of a neoplastic clone is unique and valuable in considering EBV infectibility of neoplastic B cells and resultant phenotypic changes </plain></SENT>
