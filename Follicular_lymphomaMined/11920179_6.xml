<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Chromosomal translocations involving the chromosome 3q27 region are common in B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), mainly diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL) and less often in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of these rearrangements involve the same major translocation cluster (MTC) on the 3q27 region, disrupting the LAZ3/BCL6 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some of those translocations are difficult to detect by cytogenetic analysis and/or Southern-blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present report we used a FISH assay to improve the detection of LAZ3/BCL6 rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We isolated a YAC clone (803g3), containing the BCL6 gene, in order to analyze by FISH 19 cases of B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with cytogenetically detectable 3q27 rearrangement, including reciprocal translocation in 11 cases, deletion in two cases, and addition of undefined chromosomal material on 3q27 in six cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the 11 cases with reciprocal translocation, FISH results confirmed cytogenetic data and showed disruption of the LAZ3 region: four t(3;4)(q27;p13), two t(3;11)(q27;q23.1), four t(3;14)(q27;q32) and one t(2;3)(p12;q27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two of the cases, reciprocal t(3;14) was associated with other cytogenetically detectable abnormalities of 3q27, but FISH showed that they did not affect the LAZ3 gene region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FISH demonstrated a reciprocal translocation with LAZ3 gene rearrangement in two of the six patients with add 3q27: one t(3;11) and one t(3;14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the two patients with del(3q27), one had two 3q27 FISH signals and one had only one 3q27 FISH signal, but no LAZ3 gene rearrangement was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We have identified a YAC containing the LAZ3/BCL6 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This YAC probe could be useful in clinical practice to demonstrate LAZ3 rearrangements by FISH analysis on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples in NHL </plain></SENT>
