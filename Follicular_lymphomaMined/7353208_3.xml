<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present the first reported case of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with a nodular pattern in infancy, accompanied by a detailed histopathological study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis is based upon unquestionable histopathological data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Remarkable are the macroscopic findings of the lesion, the very young age of the patient, and the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-like appearance of the lesion in addition to the nodular pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another case of cutaneous nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in an infant was previously reported by Traggis et al. but without a detailed histopathological description </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These two cases, in consideration of the rarity of nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in children, promote speculative considerations, especially in regard to etiology and therapy </plain></SENT>
