<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 overexpression was originally described in a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but more recently bcl-2 expression has been observed in a variety of other human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Variation in the frequency of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in hormone-sensitive tissues, such as the endometrium, is known to occur as a result of hormonal changes in both physiological and pathological circumstances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we examined bcl-2 protein expression in a total of 170 samples of endometrial tissues (18 proliferative endometrium, 14 secretory endometrium, 35 adenomatous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> and 103 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with p53, pRb and c-erbB-2 proteins expression, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> receptors status, with the proliferative activity and with clinicopathological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of bcl-2 protein was lower in the group of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, when compared with the cases of adenomatous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> (p &lt; 0.0001), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> proliferative (p &lt; 0.0001) and secretory endometrium (p = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> proliferative endometrium bcl-2 expression was correlated with PCNA (p = 0.026) and in secretory endometrium it was correlated with ER status (p = 0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasias</z:mpath>, bcl-2 was correlated with PCNA (p = 0.019) and the PR (p = 0.007) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, decreased bcl-2 expression was associated with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A positive relationship between bcl-2 expression and pRb, as well as PCNA score (p = 0.014 and p = 0.001, respectively), was also found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that bcl-2 expression may play a role in the inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0012114'>endometrial carcinoma</z:hpo> and its expression seems to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation and cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
