<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We treated a patient with advanced follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> by administering a preparative chemotherapy regimen followed by autologous T cells genetically engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that recognized the B-cell antigen CD19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> underwent a dramatic regression, and B-cell precursors were selectively eliminated from the patient's bone marrow after infusion of anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood B cells were absent for at least 39 weeks after anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T-cell infusion despite prompt recovery of other blood cell counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consistent with eradication of B-lineage cells, serum immunoglobulins decreased to very low levels after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prolonged and selective elimination of B-lineage cells could not be attributed to the chemotherapy that the patient received and indicated antigen-specific eradication of B-lineage cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adoptive transfer of anti-CD19-CAR-expressing T cells is a promising new approach for treating B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
