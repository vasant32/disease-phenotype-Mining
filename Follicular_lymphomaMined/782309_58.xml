<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stage III or Stage IV disease was established in 141 of 170 patients (80%) by nonsurgical procedures, including lymphangiography (positive in 78%), bone-marrow biopsy (positive in 39%), percutaneous liver biopsy (positive in 21%), and peritoneoscopy-directed liver biopsy (positive in 29% of those tested) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Staging laparotomy showed disease outside conventional nodal irradiation fields in 21 of 26 patients with a positive lymphangiogram, but in only three of 17 patients with a negative lymphangiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The yield of staging procedures was highest in patients with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, only 6% of whom were Stage I or Stage II after staging, but was lowest in patients with histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 30% of whom had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study shows that the presence of disseminated disease can be detected in the majority of patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> without the use of staging laparotomy </plain></SENT>
