<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It occurs in more than 85% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-Rt-PCR) analysis using double-labeled fluorogenic probes is a new tool in the detection and quantification of t(14;18)-carrying cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 239 specimens with Q-Rt-PCR to detect and quantify t(14;18)-carrying cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate the clinical usefulness of the quantitative assessment, we analyzed the clinical correlation with 92 FL patients of varying clinical status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 59 previously untreated patients, patients with stage IV disease had significantly higher quantities of t(14;18)-carrying cells measurable in the bone marrow or the peripheral blood than patients in clinical stages I to III (P = .003 and .043, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, of the 33 posttherapy patients. the patients in complete remission appeared to have lower detectable levels of t(14;18)-carrying cells than patients in partial remission or with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Q-Rt-PCR permits a sensitive and quantitative assessment of the extent of disease involvement in patients with t(14;18)-carrying FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The technique has the potential to be a useful tool in the diagnosis of FL, disease assessment, and prognosticating patients' clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
