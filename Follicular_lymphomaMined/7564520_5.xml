<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Changes of the immunophenotype, especially of the expression of immunoglobulin (Ig) have been documented less frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples of two patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e>, were studied by Southern blot analysis for rearrangements of the Ig genes and the oncogenes BCL2 and MYC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both patients, the general pattern of Ig gene rearrangements, especially of the Ig light-chain genes, and the structure of the t(14;18) breakpoint as assessed by the polymerase chain reaction (PRC) and fine restriction mapping, remained unaltered with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, both within the functional Ig heavy-chain allele and around the t(14;18) breakpoint, extensive secondary alterations took place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This indicates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> rather than the appearance of an independent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the first case with progression from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 3 years after diagnosis, alterations were especially present 3' of the t(14;18) breakpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the second patient with a change from follicular to diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 4 years after diagnosis, subsequent class switches from IgM to IgG and to defective IgH expression were accompanied by deletion of C mu sequences and a rearrangement of the MYC gene, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in both patients alterations in individual restriction sites occurred, which most likely were due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> within both the functional IgH and translocated allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that complex alterations of both the functional and non-functional IgH allele may accompany <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> and may erroneously suggest the appearance of independent clones by Southern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It remains to be established whether these alterations are causative events or the consequence of genetic instability and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> </plain></SENT>
