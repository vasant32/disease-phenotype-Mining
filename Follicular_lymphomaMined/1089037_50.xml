<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study describes the ultrastructural findings in 16 cases of nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and compares these with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> germinal centers in order to determine the possible germinal center origin of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Long branching desmosome-associated dendritic reticulum cells, characteristic of germinal centers, were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 16 cases of nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Desmosomes were observed only between dendritic cells and not between lymphoid cells, and they were seen in only 1 of 7 cases of diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cells comprising the nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> share cytologic features, such as nuclear <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>blebs</z:mp> and marked nuclear indentations, with germinal center cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It appears that nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> have a close anatomical relationship to germinal centers, although their actual origin from these sites is not established by this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They are composed of lymphoid cells; we have no evidence to confirm the view that nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are derived from dendritic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Light and electron microscopic findings have been compared in order to establish the nature of large "histiocyte-like" cells in the nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Many of these cells appear to represent transformed lymphocytes rather than histiocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They are more numerous in so-called mixed "histiocytic" lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> than in poorly differentiated lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, which otherwise are ultrastructurally similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study casts doubt upon the existence of a mixed lymphocytic and histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> within the spectrum of the nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and indicates that a cytologic continuum exists between cells interpreted as poorly differentiated lymphocytes and those heretofore identified as histiocytes </plain></SENT>
