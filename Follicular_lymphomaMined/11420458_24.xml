<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The lack of precise and homogeneous criteria for the recognition of primary cutaneous follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has hindered gaining data on the frequency and clinical and molecular features of this entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the course of a review of a series of primary cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from different Spanish hospitals, we collected a series of 18 cases of primary cutaneous follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and analyzed its clinical, morphologic, and biologic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this review only cases with a follicular pattern of growth, germinal center cytology, and restriction to the skin in a minimum follow-up of 6 months have been included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases of primary cutaneous follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were characterized by the expression of classic markers of the germinal center, such as bcl6, CD10, and the presence of aggregates of follicular dendritic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They frequently express bcl2 protein, although classical t(14;18) was not found in any of the cases analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the bcl6 noncoding first exon showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in two of four cases analyzed, as would be expected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> deriving from the germinal center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinically, most cases showed initial involvement of the head and neck, with relapses in eight cases (involving the skin in five cases, both skin and lymph node in two cases, and lymph node in one case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> attributable to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data seem to imply that follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> may present initially in the skin, lacking the characteristic t(14;18) and having a relatively indolent course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recognition of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and elucidation of their molecular alterations could lead to properly adapted staging and treatment protocols for these patients </plain></SENT>
