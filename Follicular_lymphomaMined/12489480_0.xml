<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A group of 21 consecutive patients with <z:chebi fb="43" ids="53200">PCL</z:chebi>-CF (median age 56 years) presenting with single (11/21) or multiple (10/21) cutaneous lesions observed between January 1980 and June 2000 were described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The histologic features, treatment modalities and outcome were shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients mainly presented with cutaneous lesions on the head and trunk (19/21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological findings were grade I, II and III (REAL/WHO classification) in 4, 8 and 9 patients respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pattern was follicular (12/21) and diffuse (9/21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment of <z:chebi fb="43" ids="53200">PCL</z:chebi>-CF consisted in restricted field radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy (CHT) and combined modalities (CM) in 11, 5 and 5 cases respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The response to treatment was: 17 complete responses, CR (13 RT, 2CHT, 2CM), 3 partial responses, PR (1 CHT, 2 CM) and 1 non response, NR (1CHT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relapse rate was 23.8% with a median follow-up of 48 months; the estimated 4 years event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 68% and 90% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our experience demonstrates that <z:chebi fb="43" ids="53200">PCL</z:chebi>-CF are <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> with a good prognosis after adequate therapy and that the histologic features did not influence significantly both response and survival </plain></SENT>
