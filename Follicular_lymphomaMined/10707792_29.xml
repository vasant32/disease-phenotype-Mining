<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A retrospective analysis was performed to delineate the factors associated with response, and to determine the duration of response, in 87 patients with CD20-positive mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) treated with Rituximab (chimeric monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody) in two prior studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with newly-diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> (MCL1, n = 37), and previously-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> (MCL2, n = 50), received single-agent Rituximab, in the context of two multicentre clinical studies using different schedules and doses, conducted in 1996 and 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A follow-up analysis was performed at the end of 1998, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 81 patients who completed therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical modeling of factors associated with response was performed using ordered logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The duration of complete (CR) and partial response (PR), and the time to disease progression (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>), were also derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response rate (RR) was 34% (30 of 87) (81 evaluable patients, RR 37%; CR 14%), and was equivalent for MCL1 and MCL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, elevated LDH (P = 0.004); prior therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> (P = 0.01) or fludarabine phosphate (P = 0.04); WHO performance status = 2 (P = 0.02); MCL2 refractory to last prior therapy (P = 0.04); and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> (P = 0.04), each at the time of treatment with Rituximab, were significantly associated with a lower RR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, only LDH (P = 0.007) and prior <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> (P = 0.03) retained statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 1.4 years, the median <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> was 7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median duration of response was one year, and was significantly longer for patients achieving CR vs. PR (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Rituximab is active in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, and can induce complete responses in a minority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Elevated LDH at the time of therapy, and prior therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi>, are associated with a significantly lower RR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The duration of response of one year is similar to that previously reported in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
