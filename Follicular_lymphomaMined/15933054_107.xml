<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study group consisted of uniformly staged and treated patients with FL enrolled in a phase 2 trial between 1987 and 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were younger than 61 years of age, had advanced-stage FL, and were treated with a multiagent chemotherapy regimen, BP-VACOP (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>), followed by involved region radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up of living patients was 12.5 years, and the median survival was 16.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The International Prognostic Index (IPI) was predictive of overall survival (OS) (P = .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases were stained with an anti-CD68 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 99 evaluable patients with FL, 87 had less than 15 CD68+ macrophages/high-power field (hpf) (median, 7; range, 1-14) and 12 had more than 15 CD68+ macrophages/hpf (median, 20; range, 16-25) with a median OS of 16.3 vs 5.0 years, respectively (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A multivariate Cox model that included the IPI score, the histologic grade, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-associated macrophage (LAM) score, showed IPI and LAM to be independent predictors of OS (P = .009 and P = .004, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The LAM content of FL predicts survival, and these data support a prominent role for nonneoplastic immune cells in the biology of FL </plain></SENT>
