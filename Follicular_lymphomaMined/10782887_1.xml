<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Testicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> usually occur in older men and are mostly diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DLBL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They may be primary manifestation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or represent a relapse of a previous non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report details a testicular large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which was proven to be large cell transformation of a low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> biopsied 8 years earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initially, a 38-year old man was diagnosed with cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, and biopsy was interpreted as reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo>; no treatment was given, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> resolved spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight years later, the patient underwent surgery for a left testicular mass and gastroscopy for gastric symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient died 7 months later with evidence for intra-abdominal and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> after a brief but temporary response to M-BACOD chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Orchiectomy specimen and gastroscopic biopsy showed diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (CD20+), which infiltrated between well-preserved tubules in the testis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological comparison with 20 testicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> without previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed tubule infiltration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, suggesting that the tubule-preserving infiltration pattern could be a histological marker for secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involvement in testis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On re-examination, the lymph node 8 years prior was verified as follicular, predominantly small, cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with bcl2-positive follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The earlier follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the subsequent diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction and showed identical sequences of the t(14;18) translocation and immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the VH-gene sequences from the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> revealed sequence <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> consistent with ongoing mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the transformed diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had no intraclonal variation, with the sequence matching with one of the subclones from the low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that the large cell transformation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> occurs in a single follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This case also indicates that the selection of the transformed clone can be part of the natural history of disease and can occur without exposure to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
