<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Diffuse intermediately differentiated lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (IDL) is a rare (approximately 2.5%) histologic subtype of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have reviewed the morphologic, immunophenotypic, and clinical features of this disease in 23 patients treated at the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute in the 25-year period between 1963 and 1988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> are uniformly of B-cell origin, but most of them express the T-cell antigen CD5; lambda light chain was expressed nearly twice as frequently as kappa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median age at diagnosis was 58 years; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients presented with stage III or IV disease, and the natural history of disease in these patients was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median survival of patients was more than 5 years, but those with liver involvement documented by biopsy had a significantly shorter survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No other prognostic factor or combination of prognostic factors significantly affected survival in this small series; however, patients with high expression of the proliferation-associated nuclear antigen Ki-67, <z:mp ids='MP_0000340'>absence of cell</z:mp>-surface antigens CD9 and CD10, and blastic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> appeared to have poorer survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, but patients who achieved a complete response to combination chemotherapy survived longer than patients who failed to achieve a complete response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only two patients had complete responses lasting longer than 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unlike patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, those with relapsed IDL did not undergo histologic progression of the disease to an aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, as with patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, it was possible to observe patients with IDL without therapy for periods up to 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although a significant minority of patients may have very <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e>, it appears that, in most patients, IDL behaves similarly to other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with indolent histology, and thus, an optimal therapeutic approach has not yet been defined </plain></SENT>
