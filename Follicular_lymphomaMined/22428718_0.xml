<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously published an article in PharmacoEconomics in which we described a mechanism-based economic modelling approach that incorporates data obtained during phase II clinical studies on the relationships between dose, exposure and response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now describe case studies of rituximab for the treatment of follicular non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> based on this methodology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We utilized a population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic model linking serum rituximab concentration to progression-free survival, to simulate the effectiveness of rituximab in various clinical contexts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These served as inputs to economic models of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, based on National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) appraisals, to assess the cost effectiveness of rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results were compared with trial-based estimates from the NICE appraisals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a further analysis, we simulated the results of an ongoing trial to generate predictions of cost effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our analyses suggest an acceptable degree of concordance between simulation- and trial-based estimates of cost effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For first-line and maintenance therapy, deviations of £2,099 and £1,355 per QALY, respectively, from trial-based incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimates of £8,290 and £7,721 per QALY gained would not affect reimbursement decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The probability of rituximab-containing regimens being cost effective at £20,000 and £30,000 per QALY thresholds was 1 for both first-line and maintenance therapy in both simulated and trial-based analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses demonstrate the feasibility of mechanism-based economic analyses, which may have applications during drug development to the following: (i) directing future research based on the cost of reducing uncertainty; (ii) assessing subgroups, dosing schedules and protocol deviations; and (iii) informing strategic research and development and pricing decisions </plain></SENT>
