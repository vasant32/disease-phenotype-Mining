<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The prognostic values of the International Prognostic Index (IPI) and the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) have widely been demonstrated in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No attempts to assess their applicability in MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> have been made so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 143 patients with MALT-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Parameters of both IPI and FLIPI were retrospectively assessed and correlated with relapse and time to relapse as markers of clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to IPI, 96 patients (67%) were classified as low, 22 (15%) low-intermediate, 17 (12%) high-intermediate and 8 (6%) as high risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FLIPI identified 99 patients (70%) at low risk, 35 (24%) at intermediate and 9 (6%) at high risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up time of 39.5 months, 123 patients were alive and 46 patients had relapsed (median time to relapse 27 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IPI significantly correlated with time to relapse, with the typical differentiation into low, low-intermediate and high risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FLIPI divided patients into three groups, but the low and intermediate risk groups showed a similar clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In terms of additional progonostic factors, univariate analysis suggested <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> and multifocal disease as correlated with relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis, however, identified only extragastric disease as predictive of relapse (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that both IPI and FLIPI are able to discriminate prognostic subgroups in patients with MALT-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the low and intermediate group of the FLIPI did not appear to prognostically differ </plain></SENT>
