<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We performed a phase II study of oral vorinostat, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> and protein deacetylase inhibitor, to examine its efficacy and tolerability in patients with relapsed/refractory indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open label phase II study (NCT00253630), patients with relapsed/refractory follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>), or mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>), with â‰¤ 4 prior therapies were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oral vorinostat was administered at a dose of 200 mg twice daily on days 1 through 14 of a 21-day cycle until progression or unacceptable toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR), with secondary end points of progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression, duration of response, safety, and tolerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 35 eligible patients were evaluable for response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median number of vorinostat cycles received was nine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ORR was 29% (five complete responses [CR] and five partial responses [PR]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For 17 patients with FL, ORR was 47% (four CR, four PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were two of nine responders with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> (one CR, one PR), and no formal responders among the nine patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, although one patient maintained stable disease for 26 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median PFS was 15.6 months for patients with FL, 5.9 months for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, and 18.8 months for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The drug was well-tolerated over long periods of treatment, with the most common grade 3 adverse events being <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leucopenia</z:e>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Oral vorinostat is a promising agent in FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>, with an acceptable safety profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies in combination with other active agents in this setting are warranted </plain></SENT>
