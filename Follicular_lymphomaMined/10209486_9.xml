<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro experiments have shown that alterations in promoter and coding sequences of the gene abolish its <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> initiation function, which is considered crucial for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess bax gene mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e>, polymerase chain reaction-based single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (PCR-SSCP) and direct sequencing were used to detect altered sequences in the promoter region and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the six exons and their flanking sequences of the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nodal and extranodal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (n = 112) including follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, splenic marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and low- and high-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequence alterations were found in 11 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine also showed the same altered sequences in corresponding non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> control tissue samples, indicating polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the remaining two cases, sequence alterations (in exons 3 and 6) which altered the bax open reading frame were observed only in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissues, indicating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-specific point mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> through bax gene mutations is unlikely to be a common event in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, at least in the major types of nodal and extranodal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
