<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>609 patients with B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> were studied with the primary aim of analyzing the cytogenetic profile of B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo> and, if possible, define correlations with FAB classification of these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Morphological and immunological studies were performed according to criteria proposed by the FAB group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A panel of monoclonal antibodies, including at least sIg, CD19, CD5, and FMC7 was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interpretations of <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and cytogenetics were made independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When applying strict FAB criteria 65% of the cases could be classified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most of them (44%) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cases not satisfying strict FAB criteria could be divided into two groups: one closely related to CLL, and here defined as atypical CLL (aCLL) (21%) and another group consisting of patients with leukemic manifestations of B cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (LL) (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analyzable metaphases were obtained in 89% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clonal abnormalities were present in 35% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most frequent chromosomal changes were abnormalities of chromosome 11q (60 cases), <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 12 (46 cases) and structural rearrangements of chromosome 14q (44 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Statistical associations with FAB subtypes were found: aCLL and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 12 (P &lt; 0.00001); mantle zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>) and t(11;14) (P &lt; 0.00001) and del(6)(q) (P &lt; 0.0001); CLL/mixed cell type and del(6)(q) (P &lt; 0.002); follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and t(14;18) (P &lt; 0.00001); splenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with villous lymphocytes and del(7)(q) (P &lt; 0.0004); leukemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (LL) with rearrangements in chromosome 9q (P &lt; 0.0001) and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of 3 (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> was not statistically associated with any specific chromosomal abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, this subtype showed a high incidence of del(11)(q) and rearrangements of 13q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study confirms the value of cytogenetic investigation in the diagnosis of these disorders and may provide some new elements for future refinement of the FAB classification in mature B cell lymphocytic disorders </plain></SENT>
