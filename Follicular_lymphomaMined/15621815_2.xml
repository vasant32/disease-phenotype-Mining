<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lymph node histology showed classic morphologic features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152266" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MCHL">Hodgkin's disease, mixed cellularity</z:e> subtype and follicular B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotypic analysis showed immunoreactivity for CD20, CD10 and Ki-67 in the malignant small cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The areas of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> demonstrated positive immunoreactivity for CD30 and CD20 in the Hodgkin's cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both cell populations were bcl2-oncoprotein positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight courses of dose-escalated BEACOPP were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Restaging after chemotherapy showed radiological partial remission, but biopsy confirmed persisting follicular B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> without bone marrow infiltration and no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>He was treated with monoclonal CD 20-antibody (Rituximab) 10 mg/kg weekly for eight consecutive weeks due to marked positivity of CD 20-antigen in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This treatment was well tolerated and final staging showed complete remission of the composite <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This patient continues to be in remission 28 months after the end of the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in the very rare case of composite <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> a combination of chemotherapy and subsequent immunotherapy might be considered as a promising therapeutic option </plain></SENT>
