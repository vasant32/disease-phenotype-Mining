<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess fruits and/or vegetables intakes in relation to risk of NHL by a meta-analytic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We searched on PubMed database from January 1966 to September 2012 to indentify case-control and cohort studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a random-effects model to compute summary risk estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For vegetables, the summary relative risks (RRs) of NHL for high versus low intake for case-control, cohort and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies were 0.75 (95% CI, 0.60-0.94; N = 8), 0.90 (95% CI, 0.81-1.00; N = 5) and 0.81 (95%CI, 0.71-0.92; N = 13) ; and the corresponding RRs for intake of 1 serving per day were 0.88 (95% CI, 0.80-0.96; N = 8), 0.96 (95% CI, 0.92-1.00; N = 5) and 0.92 (95%CI, 0.87-0.96; N = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For fruits and vegetables combined, the summary RR for high versus low intake was 0.78 (95%CI, 0.66-0.92; N = 4), and for intake of 1 serving per day was 0.95 (95%CI, 0.91-1.00; N = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regarding histological subtypes, vegetables intake was significantly inversely associated with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but not small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (high vs. low intake, RR = 0.70, 0.70 and 1.01, respectively; N = 7, 7 and 10, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fruits intake was generally not associated with total NHL, or any histological subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that intakes of vegetables, and fruits and vegetables combined, but not fruits alone, significantly reduce risk of NHL </plain></SENT>
