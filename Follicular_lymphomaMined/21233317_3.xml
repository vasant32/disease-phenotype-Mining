<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The known importance of host immune response to FL survival led us to evaluate these germline factors in FL outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We confirm the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms rs10484561 (P = 3.5 × 10⁻⁹) and rs6457327 (P = .008) with risk of FL and demonstrate that rs6457327 predicts both time to (P = .02) and risk of (P &lt; .01) FL transformation independently of clinical variables, including the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index </plain></SENT>
