<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The detection of t(14;18)(q32;q21) is advisable for the diagnosis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 51 patients with FL, we evaluated the applicability and sensitivity of interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using commercially available reagents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 23 patients, only a formalin-fixed lymph node was available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 28 patients, both frozen and formalin-fixed lymph nodes were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization was found to be 100% applicable whatever the material type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the use of IGH-BCL2 dual-fusion, dual-color probes, t(14;18) translocation was detected in 47 (92%) of 51 FL cases with concordant results between isolated nuclei (n = 41) and frozen cytologic imprints (n = 28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two IGH-BCL2-positive cases were also studied on fixed sections with BCL2 split signal probes showing a BCL2 split in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, no BCL2 split was observed in IGH-BCL2-negative cases (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Owing to DNA degradation as assessed by the failure of control genes amplification, the applicability of PCR was found to be 76% in fixed lymph nodes (n = 51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After exclusion of the 12 noninformative cases, the BIOMED-2 protocol allowed the detection of an IGH-BCL2 fusion in 25 (64%) of 39 fixed specimens with 11 PCR-negative (31%) of 36 FISH-positive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Even on frozen material with 100% applicability, the amplification of a BCL2-JH breakpoint was achieved in only 20 (71%) of 28 cases with 5 PCR-negative (20%) out of 25 FISH-positive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, FISH was found superior to PCR (using BIOMED-2 protocol) in detecting IGH-BCL2 fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally, FISH individualized 4 IGH-BCL2-negative FL cases without specific histopathologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>With the use of split signal DNA probes, 1 case showed a <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of the BCL2 locus and another displayed BCL6 and IGH breakpoints that would suggest a t(3;14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Whether such IGH-BCL2-negative cases are characterized by alternative oncogenetic pathways remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
