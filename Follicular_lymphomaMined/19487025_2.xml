<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, truncated forms of FOXP1 have been associated with a subtype of Diffuse Large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> characterised by constitutive NFkappaB activity, indicating that they may inhibit this repression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have shown that FL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> have increased relative abundance of truncated FOXP1 isoforms and this is associated with increased expression of NFkappaB-associated genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results provide strong evidence that relative FOXP1 isoform abundance is associated with NFkappaB activity in FL, and could potentially be used as a marker for this gene signature </plain></SENT>
