<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In spite of major advances in the therapy for FL, disease-free survival remains short, and median time to progression is just over a year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with relapsed FL is safe and appears to improve disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to examine whether autologous stem cell transplantation provides long-term disease control in patients with relapsed or high-grade FL, we retrospectively evaluated our experience and analyzed the outcomes of autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with FL from 1991 to 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventeen men and seven women (n=24) of median age 47.5 years (range 28-64 years) were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients with high-risk FL were in first remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients were salvaged after relapse with second-line chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, 14 were in CR at the time of transplantation, and seven patients were transplanted with active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow was used in six patients as the source of stem cells prior to 1995 and peripheral blood stem cells were used in 18 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three of 24 patients engrafted (96%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median time for neutrophil recovery was 11.5 days (range 9-35 days) and 15 days (range 10-40 days) for platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median duration of follow-up was 6 years (range 7 months-8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the 24 patients, six have died-with one patient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to transplant-related pulmonary complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> evaluable patients were 71.6 and 40%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Median duration of response was 4.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>OS and DFS in patients transplanted in CR were 80 and 57%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>For those transplanted with disease, a complete response was achieved in 43% of patients, with the OS and DFS of 57 and 19%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Disease status at transplantation was not a significant variable for survival (p&gt;0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Three patients developed moderate to severe treatment-related toxicity, two with grade III mucositis and one with life-threatening <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>When these results are compared with historical controls or patients treated with other modalities, autologous stem cell transplantation appears to be providing the longest disease-free survival and best duration of response </plain></SENT>
