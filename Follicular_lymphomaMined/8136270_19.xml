<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> stimulated cells from peripheral blood (28 cases), spleen (two cases) and lymph node (one case) with SLVL have been analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A clonal chromosome abnormality was found in 27/31 patients (87%); this was identified as a simple abnormality in 12 cases and a complex one in 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four recurring abnormalities were seen: t(11;14)(q13;q32) in five patients, deletions or translocations involving 7q in seven patients, iso 17q in four patients and translocations involving 2p11 in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The high frequency of clonal chromosome abnormalities in SLVL contrasts with the usually benign clinical course of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities found frequently in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (CLL) such as <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 12 and deletions or translocations involving 13q14 were each seen in only one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No case had the t(14;18) characteristic of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate the high frequency of clonal and often complex chromosome abnormalities in SLVL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although a unique chromosome rearrangement has not been identified, a pattern of four recurrent abnormalities has emerged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that SLVL is distinct on cytogenetic grounds from B-CLL and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but shows similarity with mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and B-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53412">PLL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
