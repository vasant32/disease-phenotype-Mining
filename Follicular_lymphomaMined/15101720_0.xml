<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the diagnosis of 48 patients with FL and investigated the type of bcl-2 gene rearrangement using DNA from paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples obtained at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 30 cases, we also obtained consecutive peripheral blood samples to search for the presence of bcl-2/IgH rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis identified 41 (86%) patients with MBR and 5 (10%) patients with mcr rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, the type of rearrangement was not associated with clinical characteristics or IPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the type of rearrangement did not have an impact on response to initial treatment or on clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, we found an association between the type of rearrangement and the histological subtype of FL, i.e., none of mcr-positive patients presented histological grade I (p = 0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this study, we could not demonstrate a relationship between the type of bcl-2 rearrangement and the response to treatment or outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, we found a relationship between the type of rearrangement and FL histological subtype, information not previously reported </plain></SENT>
