<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To use the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique for molecular assessment of the results of myeloablative treatment of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with autologous bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-six patients with follicular or transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 60 mg/kg x 2 and total-body irradiation 12 Gy, supported by autologous bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow mononuclear cell fraction was treated in vitro with CD20 monoclonal antibody and baby rabbit complement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The PCR technique was used to identify 50 patients with amplifiable t(14; 18) translocations in biopsy material from lymph nodes or bone marrow infiltrated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Following treatment of the harvested bone marrow in vitro, 29 samples were tested by PCR to assess the efficacy of purging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 25 cases, the same t(14; 18) sequences were amplified as from the patients' original biopsies, while in four cases, the marrow became PCR-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of the four patients treated with PCR-negative marrow subsequently developed recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, compared with 11 of 25 in the PCR-positive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow and peripheral-blood mononuclear cell samples from 27 patients were studied during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one had the presence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-related t(14; 18) clone detectable by PCR and confirmed by direct sequencing from at least one sample between 3 months and 7 years after reinfusion of the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up duration of 3 years, 13 patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e>, 13 remained in remission with the t(14; 18) still detectable, and one died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This form of therapy does not eliminate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-related t(14; 18)-bearing clone of cells, although the significance of its continued presence is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Improved methods for both treatment of the bone marrow in vitro and treatment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in vivo are required </plain></SENT>
