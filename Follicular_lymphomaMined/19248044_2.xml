<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: : Recent experience has suggested that there has been a stepwise improvement in the survival outcomes of patients who have follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with the introduction of new treatment options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, the authors report the results of 2 subsequent phase 2 trials of 238 previously untreated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: : In a trial of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi>, epidoxorubicin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (BACOP) plus fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (FND), 144 patients received 2 BACOP treatments followed by 4 FND treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a trial of BACOP plus fludarabine and rituximab (FR), 94 patients received 3 BACOP treatments followed by 4 FR treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: : The complete remission (CR) rate for BACOP/FND was 62% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 60 months, the failure-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e>) and overall survival (OS) rates at 4 years were 53% and 77%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CR rate for BACOP/FR was 79% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 36 months, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> and OS rates at 4 years were 56% and 97%, respectively, which were significant compared with the CR and OS rates achieved with BACOP/FND </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five of 42 bcl-2-positive patients attained a molecularly negative CR and had improved <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed between the 2 trials in the percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: : The CR and OS rates achieved with BACOP/FR were better, and overall toxicity did not increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients who received rituximab had a better <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> compared with patients who received chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally, although conclusions between nonrandomized groups may depend on differences in observed and unobserved prognostic features, the current results suggested that the addition of rituximab to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-fludarabine-containing regimens have a favorable effect on the prognosis of patients with advanced follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
