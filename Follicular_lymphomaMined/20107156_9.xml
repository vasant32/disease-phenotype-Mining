<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is an effective treatment for patients with poor risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, at least in part because of the graft-versus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over the past decade, reduced intensity conditioning regimens have been shown to offer results similar to those of conventional high-dose conditioning regimens but with lower toxicity early after transplantation, especially in patients with chemosensitive disease at transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: The aim of this study was to analyze the long-term outcome of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who received an HLA identical sibling allogeneic stem cell transplant with a reduced intensity conditioning regimen within prospective trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prospective multicenter studies considered included 37 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation between 1998 and 2007 with a fludarabine plus melphalan-based reduced intensity conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 50 years (range, 34-62 years) and the median follow-up was 52 months (range, 0.6 to 113 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most patients (77%) had stage III-IV at diagnosis, and patients had received a median of three lines of therapy before the reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the time of transplantation, 14 patients were in complete remission, 16 in partial remission and 7 had refractory or progressive disease after salvage chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 4-year overall survival rates for patients in complete remission, partial remission, or with refractory or progressive disease were 71%, 48% and 29%, respectively (P=0.09), whereas the 4-year cumulative incidences of non-relapse mortality were 26% (95% CI, 11-61), 33% (95% CI, 16-68) and 71% (95% CI, 44-100), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of relapse for the whole group was only 8% (95% CI, 2-23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that this strategy of reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplantation may be associated with significant non-relapse mortality in heavily pre-treated patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but a remarkably low relapse rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Long-term survival is likely in patients without progressive or refractory disease at the time of transplantation </plain></SENT>
