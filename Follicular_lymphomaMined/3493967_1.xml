<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A monoclonal antibody, SN3, has been prepared against a cell membrane fraction of the pre-B leukemic cell line NALM-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By radioimmunoassay, SN3 reacted with four of four non-T/non-B, two of two pre-B and one of three leukemic B cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The reagent was unreactive, however, with established leukemic T and myelomonocytic cell lines or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On immunohistochemical assays on frozen sections of nine reactive lymph nodes and three spleens, SN3 showed a preferential binding to 50-95 per cent mantle zone (MZ) cells and 5-20 per cent interfollicular or red pulp B-lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was uninhibited by pre-incubation with heterologous anti-HLA-DR or anti-delta reagents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SN3 was unreactive with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> germinal centre (GC), epidermal or Langerhans cells but did react with less than 1 per cent thymic B-lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In eight follicular small cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> tested SN3 exhibited three patterns of reactivity: peripheral follicular, combined peripheral and central follicular, and combined follicular and interfollicular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were essentially SN3- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In three diffuse small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, SN3 showed patchy areas of reactivity unassociated with proliferation centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In four diffuse B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (one mixed small and large cell, two large non-cleaved cell, and one small non-cleaved (Burkitt) cell), SN3 reactivity was uniformly distributed in the majority (60-90 per cent) of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SN3 was unreactive with one diffuse B-large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, three nodal T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and three cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mycosis fungoides</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The findings indicate that SN3 detects an antigen that is present in subpopulations of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MZ cells, the antigen is also detected in GC cells undergoing lymphomatous transformation but is not readily detected in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GC cells, and the antigen is also expressed in subpopulations of diffuse B- but not T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
