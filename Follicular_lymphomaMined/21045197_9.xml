<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated idiotype vaccination as primary intervention for treatment-naive indolent B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in a separate cohort as remission consolidation after chemotherapy to assess immunization-induced immune responses in relation to progression-free survival (German Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00000227) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients in each cohort received 6 intradermal injections of adjuvanted recombinant idiotype Fab fragment (Fab(Id)); 76% of patients in both groups developed anti-idiotype antibodies and/or cellular immunity as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and interferon-Î³ ELISpot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In treatment-naive patients, only cellular responses correlated with superior progression-free survival (P &lt; .002) and durable objective remissions (P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunization-induced T cells recognized hypermutated or complementarity-determining region 3 epitopes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After remission consolidation immunization, induction of anti-idiotype antibodies correlated with progression-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0010976'>Low B-cell counts</z:hpo> after rituximab therapy predicted for failure to develop anti-idiotype antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results are similar to published trials showing an association of humoral immunity with control of residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, effective immunity against untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> appears to be dependent on idiotype-specific T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sustained remissions in patients with vaccination-induced cellular immunity suggest clinical benefit and warrant a randomized comparison of this vaccine with expectant management for asymptomatic follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
