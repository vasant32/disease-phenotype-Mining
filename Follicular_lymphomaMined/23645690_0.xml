<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four randomized trials demonstrated a clinical benefit for patients treated with rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, no long-term follow-up (ie &gt; 5 years) of these trials is yet available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between May 2000 and May 2002, 358 newly diagnosed patients with high-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were randomized to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, adriamycin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> plus interferon-Î±2a or a similar chemotherapy-based regimen plus rituximab and outcome was updated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 8.3 years, addition of rituximab remained significantly associated with prolonged event-free survival (primary endpoint) (P=0.0004) with a trend towards a benefit for overall survival (P=0.076) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index score was strongly associated with outcome for both event-free and overall survival in univariate analysis and its prognostic value remained highly significant after adjusting for other significant covariates in multivariate models (P&lt;0.0001 and P=0.001 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Considering long-term toxicity, the addition of rituximab in first line setting was confirmed as safe with regards to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">secondary malignancies</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated in the FL2000 study confirms the sustained clinical benefit of rituximab without long-term toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00136552 </plain></SENT>
