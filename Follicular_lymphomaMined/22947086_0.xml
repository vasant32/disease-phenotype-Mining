<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The focus of this work was to investigate this correlation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study analyzed 57 tumors in 19 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients treated with I-131 tositumomab and imaged with SPECT/CT multiple times after tracer and therapy administrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Instead of the typical least-squares fit to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1298180" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">single tumor</z:e>'s measured time-activity data, estimation was accomplished via a biexponential mixed model in which the curves from multiple subjects were jointly estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-absorbed dose estimates were determined by patient-specific Monte Carlo calculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mixed model gave realistic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> time-activity fits that showed the expected uptake and clearance phases even with noisy data or missing time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correlation between tracer and therapy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-residence times (r=0.98; p&lt;0.0001) and correlation between tracer-predicted and therapy-delivered mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-absorbed doses (r=0.86; p&lt;0.0001) were very high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The predicted and delivered absorbed doses were within ± 25% (or within ± 75 cGy) for 80% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The mixed-model approach is feasible for fitting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> time-activity data in RIT treatment planning when individual least-squares fitting is not possible due to inadequate sampling points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The good correlation between predicted and delivered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> doses demonstrates the potential of using a pretherapy tracer study for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> dosimetry-based treatment planning in RIT </plain></SENT>
