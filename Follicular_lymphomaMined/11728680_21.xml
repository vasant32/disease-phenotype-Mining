<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To analyze the long-term results with radiotherapy (RT) for early-stage, low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1960 to 1988, 80 patients with Stage I (n = 33) or II (n = 47), World Health Organization Grade 1 (n = 50) or 2 (n = 30) follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were treated with RT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lymph nodes or spleen were involved in 97% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The maximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sizes ranged from 0.5 to 11.0 cm (median 2.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The RT fields encompassed only the involved Ann Arbor nodal region (involved-field RT) in 9% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fields also included 1-3 adjacent, grossly uninvolved nodal regions (regional RT) in 54% of patients but were smaller than mantle or whole abdominopelvic fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mantle or whole abdominopelvic fields encompassing up to 6 grossly uninvolved regions (extended-field RT) were used in the remaining 37% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total RT doses ranged from 26.2 to 50.0 Gy given in daily 1.0-3.0-Gy fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The follow-up of the surviving patients ranged from 3.5 to 28.7 years (median 19.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No recurrences were found &gt;17.0 years after RT, with 13 patients free of disease at their last follow-up visit 17.6-25.0 years after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 58% of cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was not from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 15-year local control rate was 100% for 44 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> &lt;3.0 cm treated with only 27.8-30.8 Gy (median 30.0 in 20 fractions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival was affected by the maximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size at the start of RT (15-year rate 49% vs. 29% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> &lt;3.0 cm vs. &gt; or =3.0 cm, respectively, p = 0.04) and Ann Arbor stage (15-year rate 66% vs. 26% for Stages I and II, respectively, p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ann Arbor stage also affected the cause-specific survival (15-year rate 87% vs. 54% for Stages I and II, respectively, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found in overall survival between those treated with extended-field RT and those treated with involved-field RT or regional RT (15-year rate 49% and 40%, respectively, p = 0.51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The 15-year incidence rate of Grade 3 or greater late complications according to the Subjective, Objective, Management, and Analytical scale in patients treated with 26.2-30.8 Gy vs. 30.9-50.0 Gy was 0% and 6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RT can cure approximately one half of Stage I and one quarter of Stage II, World Health Organization Grade 1 or 2 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> &lt;3.0 cm can be controlled locally with doses of 27.8-30.8 Gy, and there is a trend toward a higher incidence of late complications with doses of &gt;30.8 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Doses of 25-30 Gy delivered in 15-20 fractions should be examined prospectively in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of &lt;3.0 cm </plain></SENT>
