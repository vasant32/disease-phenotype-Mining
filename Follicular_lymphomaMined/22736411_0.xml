<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this single-center, retrospective analysis of a large cohort of 144 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> was to elucidate the role of prognostic markers, treatments, and outcomes in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In total, 144 patients were identified who were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> at the authors' institution between 2003 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on clinical parameters, treatments, response, and survival were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the validity of the International Prognostic Index (IPI) and Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) prognostic scores were tested in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 144 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>, 96 patients (67%) had extralymph node (extranodal) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>, 32 patients (22%) had lymph node (nodal) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>, and 16 patients (11%) had splenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-year progression-free survival rate was 82% in the nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> group, 88% in the extranodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> group, and 74% in the splenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> group and did not different between the 3 groups (P = .60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall survival rate was excellent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 MZL groups (nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>, 89%; extranodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>, 92%; splenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>, 82%; P = .46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our cohort, the FLIPI score was a significant prognostic marker: The 5-year progression-free survival rate for patients who had FLIPI scores of 0 to 2 (low or intermediate risk) was excellent at 92%, whereas it was only 62% for patients who had FLIPI scores of 3 to 5 (poor risk; P = .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the 5-year overall survival rate for patients who had FLIPI scores of 0 to 2 was 95%, whereas it was only 62% for patients who had FLIPI scores of 3 to 5 (P = .0009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The FLIPI score had strong prognostic value in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients who have low-risk or intermediate-risk FLIPI scores have an excellent prognosis, whereas patients with poor-risk FLIPI scores are candidates for novel treatment approaches </plain></SENT>
