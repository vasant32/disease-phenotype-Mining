<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study sought to investigate whether the copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (cnLOH) profiles of these minimally evolved t(14;18)(q32;q21)-positive follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (MEV-FL) cases are similar to or different from the majority of FL cases with more karyotypic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array analysis was applied to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> genomes of 23 MEV-FL biopsy samples to assess for the presence of cnLOH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These cases carried either a single or no chromosomal abnormality in addition to t(14;18)(q32;q21) as determined by karyotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that, although these MEV-FL cases had simple karyotypes, they showed very similar cnLOH profiles as compared to cytogenetically complex cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most frequent regions affected by cnLOH were 1p (17%), 6p (17%), 12q (13%) and 16p (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that cnLOH alterations may serve as important contributors to the pathological and clinical manifestations of FL </plain></SENT>
