<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The most effective treatment for recurrent non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) appears to be a high-dose cytotoxic chemotherapy (HDC) followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has been suggested that the presence of occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in harvested marrow may be responsible for a significant fraction of treatment failures after HDC/ABMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study examined randomly accrued NHL patients, independent of their cytogenic grades, for the presence of cells bearing bcl-2/immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangements in lymph node (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>) biopsies and the bone marrow by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot hybridization combined with a classical culturing technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 41 NHL patients examined, bcl-2/IgH translocations were evident in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> biopsies and marrow from each of 10 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, but not in any samples from 31 newly diagnosed diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Marrow aspirates from several patients that were cultured using a one-week "triggering culture" followed by an extended period of conventional culture resulted in emergence of a monoclonal, IgH-rearranged, bcl-2-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such outgrowth was specifically seen in cultures of diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> marrow (7 of 28 evaluable patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Southern analysis for IgH rearrangement within <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> biopsies and of cells cultured from marrow of individual diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients produced identical patterns, suggesting that the occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells present in harvested marrow were derived from the predominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell population represented within involved lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The culture of histologically occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from diagnostic marrow and analysis of the derived cells by Southern blot hybridization can be used to detect potentially aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells within harvested marrow, despite their lack of bcl-2 gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
