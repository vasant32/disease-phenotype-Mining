<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to explore the relationship between the single nucleotide polymorphisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e> (G23591A, A35931C) and individual susceptibility to non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) in Shandong populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e> gene polymorphism in 309 cases of NHL and 305 healthy controls were detected using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay in a case-control molecular epidemiology study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The association between gene polymorphism and the risk of NHL were examined through comparing odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) between two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that no significant association between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e> (G23591A, A35931C) polymorphism and the risk of whole NHL was shown at first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the further analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL cases were divided into four groups: follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) group, diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) group, T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> group and other B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Frequencies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e> 23591GA + AA genotypes were 16.3%, 18.0%, 10.5% and 18.4% in each subgroup respectively, while 12.5% in control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Individuals carrying GA + AA genotype had 1.43, 1.58, 0.89 and 1.50-fold risk of NHL sub groups as much as GG genotype, but no statistically significant difference between subgroups and control was found (p&gt;0.05); frequencies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e> 35931AC + CC genotypes were 15.2%, 15.8%, 18.4% and 12.5% in each subgroup, while 11.5% in control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Individuals carrying AC + CC genotype had 1.41, 1.48, 1.75 and 1.12-fold risk of NHL subgroup as much as AA genotype, but there were also no statistically significant difference between each subgroup and control (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the gene polymorphism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XPD</z:e> (G23591A, G935931C) does not associate with the risk of developing NHL in Shandong populations </plain></SENT>
