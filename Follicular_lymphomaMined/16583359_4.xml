<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Marginal zone differentiation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL), sometimes referred to as monocytoid B-cell differentiation, is a relatively uncommon phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, this type of differentiation was also linked to secondary cytogenetic aberrations of chromosome 3 in a small number of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have analysed 131 primary nodal FL with t(14;18)(q32;q21) for secondary cytogenetic aberrations previously described as recurrent in marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>) to identify their frequency and possible association with morphological evidence of marginal zone differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We searched for <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of chromosomes 3, 12, and 18, gains of chromosome arm 3q, deletions of chromosome arm 7p, structural anomalies with break-points in 1q21 and 1p34, as well as the t(1;2)(p22;p12), t(1;14)(p22;q32), t(3;14)(q27;q32), t(6;14)(p21;q32), and t(11;18)(q21;q21) translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At least focal morphological evidence of marginal zone differentiation occurred in 35/131 (27%) FL with t(14;18)(q32;q21) as the primary chromosomal abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the recurrent balanced translocations characteristic of extranodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> were seen secondarily in the nodal FLs with t(14;18)(q32;q21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, 43/131 (33%) cases had at least one of the above secondary cytogenetic aberrations previously reported as recurrent aberrations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> and, when combined, these were significantly more frequent in FL with morphological evidence of marginal zone differentiation (p&lt;0.0001, two-sided Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aberrations of chromosome 3 and, in particular, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 3 occurred frequently in FL with marginal zone differentiation (p=0.002 and p&lt;0.0001, respectively, two-sided Fisher's exact test), while chromosome 21, 22, and X chromosome aberrations, which have not been described previously as recurrent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>, were also significantly associated with marginal zone differentiation in FL (p=0.002, p=0.037, p=0.039, respectively, two-sided Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
