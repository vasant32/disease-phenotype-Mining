<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report two unusual cases of hyaline vascular type <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017531" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GLNH|AFLH">Castleman's disease</z:e> showing a pale clear cuff of mantle zone lymphocytes presenting a marginal zone distribution pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cells had medium-sized round or slightly indented nuclei and a moderate amount of clear cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The histopathologic findings in our cases were similar to those of nodal marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, immunohistochemistry demonstrated that both the mantle zone lymphocytes and the pale cuff of the lymphoid cells were CD20+, CD79a+, sIgM+, sIgD+, CD5-, CD10-, CD43-, CD45RO-, Bcl-2+, Bcl-6- and cyclin D1- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The polytypic nature of these cells was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reactive lymph node lesions only rarely show mantle cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> with clear cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This unusual mantle cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> with clear cytoplasm associated with a hyaline vascular type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017531" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GLNH|AFLH">Castleman's disease</z:e> should be differentiated from nodal marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment, it is suggested that immunophenotypic and genotypic studies might be required, and furthermore careful attention should be paid to the morphologic examination </plain></SENT>
