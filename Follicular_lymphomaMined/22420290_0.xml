<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nitrate and <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> are precursors in the formation of N-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35800">nitroso compounds</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently found a 40% increased risk of NHL with higher dietary <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> intake and significant increases in risk for follicular and T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is possible that these compounds also affect NHL prognosis by enhancing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> in addition to development by further impairing immune system function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that nitrate and <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> intake affects NHL survival, we evaluated the association in study participants that have been followed post-disease diagnosis in a population-based case-control study among women in Connecticut </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We did not observe a significant increasing trend of mortality for NHL overall or by subtype for nitrate or <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> intake for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from NHL or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from any cause, although a borderline significant protective trend was observed for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with increasing nitrate intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We did not identify a difference in overall survival for nitrate (P = 0.39) or for <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> (P = 0.66) or for NHL specific survival for nitrate (P = 0.96) or <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> (P = 0.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, our null findings do not confer support for the possibility that dietary nitrate and <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> intake impacts NHL survival by promoting immune unresponsiveness </plain></SENT>
