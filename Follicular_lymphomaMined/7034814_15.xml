<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a highly unusual lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It appeared to originate in the mantle zones of hyperplastic follicles that had large reactive centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in the mantle zone were small lymphocytes with cleaved or very irregular nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They had coarse and abundant IgM, kappa surface immunoglobulin markers, and receptors for complement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> involvement was generalized at the time of discovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of a malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was initially made with difficulty because of the presence of reactive follicular centers as well as a polyclonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0010702'>hypergammaglobulinemia</z:hpo> and large numbers of interfollicular plasma cells and plasmacytoid lymphocytes containing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> classes of immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, 2 yr later, the follicular centers were replaced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> nodules composed of lymphocytes identical in appearance and immunologic type to those seen originally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This case illustrates that not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are follicular center cell (FCC) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and that morphological transformation from small round to small cleaved lymphocytes and a corresponding increase in surface immunoglobulins may take place in the follicular mantle zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient had a high titer of antibody to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and a poor lymphocyte response to concanavalin A, but neither the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells nor the plasmacytoid lymphocytes contained EBV DNA </plain></SENT>
