<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No effect modifications were found for women who started using hair dyes in 1980 or afterward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For women who started using hair dye before 1980 as compared with never users, a statistically significantly increased risk of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was found for carriers of CYP2C9 Ex3-52C&gt;T TT/CT genotypes (odds ratio (OR) = 2.9, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.4, 6.1), CYP2E1 -332T&gt;A AT/AA genotypes (OR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.2, 3.4), a homozygous or heterozygous 3-base-pair deletion in intron 6 of GSTM3 (OR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.3, 4.1), GSTP1 Ex5-24A&gt;G AA genotypes (OR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.9), or NAT2 genotypes conferring intermediate/rapid acetylator status (OR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.0, 2.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The observed associations were mainly seen for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no significantly increased risk was observed for starting hair dye use before 1980 (relative to never use) among women who were homozygous <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> for the CYP2C9, CYP2E1, or GSTM3 polymorphisms, women carrying 1 or 2 copies of the variant GSTP1 allele, or women who were slow NAT2 acetylators </plain></SENT>
