<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used the B-cell-associated antigens CD19 and CD20 as target structures on human leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that a combination of bispecific antibody fragments (bsFab2) with target x CD3 and target x CD28 specificity induces vigorous autologous T-cell activation and killing of malignant cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow cultures from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The bsFab2 targeting CD20 were considerably more effective than those binding to CD19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The colony-forming capacity of treated bone marrow was impaired due to large amounts of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha produced during bsFab2-induced T-cell activation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD20 x CD28 bsFab2, when used alone rather than in combination, markedly improved the recognition of leukemic cells by allogeneic T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these reagents may be capable of enhancing the immunogenicity of leukemic cells in general and, in particular, of increasing the antileukemic activity of allogeneic donor buffy coat cells in relapsed bone marrow transplanted patients </plain></SENT>
