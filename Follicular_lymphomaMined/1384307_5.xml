<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors have observed a unique case of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in which the central zones of neoplastic nodules were composed predominantly of small cleaved cells (<z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>) that were surrounded by small lymphoid cells proliferating in wide mantles as in mantle zone (MZ) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The central <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> component displayed a follicular <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-like phenotype (IgD-, CD10+, CD5-, CD68-), whereas the neoplastic cells of the peripheral zones had an MZ <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-like phenotypic profile (IgD+, CD10-, CD5+, CD68+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In extranodal involved tissues, either follicular or diffuse (leukemic-like) patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> infiltration were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analyses showed in the bone marrow or the peripheral blood two leukemic B cell populations, one mimicking the phenotypic profile (IgM+, IgD+, CD5+, CD10-, Leu8-) of small lymphoid cells with MZ-like features, and the other with phenotypic features (IgM+, IgD-, CD5+, CD10+, Leu8+) intermediate between those of MZ-like cells and those of the <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> component (follicular center-like) detected in the lymph node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunomagnetic sorting and gene rearrangement studies indicated that both CD10+ and CD10- B lymphocytes and lymph node neoplastic B cells shared the same clonal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This unusual follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> can be viewed as the result of the proliferation of a single follicular progenitor capable of differentiating toward both a germinal center and an MZ phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The simultaneous presence in the same patient of at least three neoplastic B-cell populations at different maturation stages, encompassing follicular center and MZ phenotypes, and showing the same clonal derivation, indicates a close lineage relationship between follicular <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> and MZ <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
