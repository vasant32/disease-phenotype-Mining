<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The blood lymphocytes were small with scanty cytoplasm, densely condensed nuclear chromatin, and deep clefts originating in sharp angles from the nuclear surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLL cells are larger, have more cytoplasm, a different pattern of chromatin condensation, and may have shallow nuclear indentations or foldings rather than clefts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The circulating follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells had moderate to strong membrane immunoglobulins (SmIg), low mouse (M)-rosettes, strong reactivity with the monoclonal antibody FMC7, and occasional expression of the CD5-antigen; at least one third of cells in each case were positive with anti-cALLa (J5,CD10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Half the cases were referred as B-CLL but none had the typical B-CLL immunophenotype: weak SmIg, M-rosettes of greater than 50%, CD5 positive, FMC7 and J5 negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was confirmed by lymph node biopsy in seven of the 10 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall response to treatment was poor and five patients died within three years of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This aggressive form of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> needs to be distinguished from B-CLL as different management is required </plain></SENT>
