<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This compound with amphoteric properties was designed in the former Germany Democratic Republic in 1960s and re-discovered in 1990s with multiple successive well-designed studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bendamustine possesses a unique mechanism of action with potential <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35221">antimetabolite</z:chebi> properties, and only partial cross-resistance with other alkylators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Used in combination with rituximab in vitro, bendamustine shows synergistic effects against various <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In clinical studies, bendamustine plus rituximab is highly effective in patients with relapsed-refractory indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, inducing remissions in 90% or more and a median progression-free survival of 23-24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The optimal dosing and schedule of bendamustine administration is largely undecided and varies among studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results of ongoing trials and dose-finding studies will help to further help ascertain the optimal place of bendamustine in the management of indolent NHL </plain></SENT>
