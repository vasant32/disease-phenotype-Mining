<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> (FNA) with immunophenotyping by immunocytochemistry (IC) on cytospins has recently received increased consideration in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to establish the diagnostic value of a four-color flow cytometric (FCM) panel, including cytoplasmic Bcl-2, in cytologic diagnosis of malignant non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> (RH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated 424 FNAs from 396 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FCM panel included lambda/kappa/CD19/CD5, CD23/CD10/CD20/CD19, CD4/CD7/CD8/CD3 and Bcl-2/CD10/CD19/CD3 in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi>, phycoerythrin, and peridinin <z:chebi fb="24" ids="18230">chlorophyll</z:chebi> protein or a tandem conjugate of R-phycoerythrin and indodicarbocyanine and allophycocyanin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 expression was evaluated separately for gated B and T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 97% of 172 RH samples, FCM was concordant with the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FCM gave correct immunologic diagnosis in 95% of low-grade B-cell NHLs, 78% of high-grade B-cell NHLs, and 53% of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Malignant B cells had higher Bcl-2 expression than did reactive B and T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This helped to establish a correct diagnosis especially in cases where no clear-cut monoclonality could be shown by kappa/lambda staining or where there was no expression of surface light chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The highest Bcl-2 expression was found in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our FCM panel allowed precise classification of NHL in FNA material in 89.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 staining can be recommended for primary differentiation between reactive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> and NHL </plain></SENT>
