<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As part of a retrospective study into the prevalence of the t(14;18) translocation in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, we assessed the suitability of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the t(14;18) major breakpoint region (MBR) in frozen and formalin-fixed tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Considering Southern blotting as a standard, the sensitivity of PCR was 81% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the various procedures used to extract DNA from paraffin-embedded tissue (PET), proteinase K digestion in the presence of nonionic detergents gave the highest yield and quality of DNA and the most efficient amplification rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using this method, excellent amplification rates (100%) were obtained for both the beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> control sequence and the MBR t(14;18) for fixed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> specimens collected in the previous 2 to 6 years (n = 27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of nine older PETs, PCR on six gave inconsistent results, probably because of the poorer-quality substrate used for amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specimens exposed to formol <z:chebi fb="16" ids="31823">sublimate</z:chebi> or formalin-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi>-alcohol were as suitable for amplification as tissues fixed in neutral-buffered formalin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of the MBR t(14;18) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> specimens as detected by both Southern blotting and PCR was 59% (23 of 39) </plain></SENT>
