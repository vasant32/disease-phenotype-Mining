<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the clinicopathologic, immunohistologic, and genotypic features of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> arising from the salivary glands, we examined 20 cases of operatively resected primary salivary gland <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and identified 6 such cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 4 women and 2 men with ages ranging from 38 to 64 years (median 50 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> arose from the parotid gland in 4 cases and the submandibular gland in the remaining 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four patients were stage IE and 2 were stage IIE-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up period was 49 months and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were alive and well at the time of going to press </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histologically, 5 patients were follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade 2, and 1 was grade 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> specimens in noninfiltrating salivary gland tissue, there was periductal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262091" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lymphocytic infiltration</z:e> near the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, myoepithelial <z:mp ids='MP_0001870'>sialoadenitis</z:mp> was noted in 2 lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An immunohistochemical study revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 cases were CD10+, CD79a+, bcl-6+, CD3-, CD5-, CD21-, CD23-, and CyclinD1- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells expressed bcl-2 in 3 cases and p53 oncoprotein in 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two cases revealed clonal bands with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2/IgH translocation at the major breakpoint region was detected in 1 case (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We found a relatively high incidence of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (30%) in salivary gland <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Among the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) system, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> appeared to occur frequently in the salivary glands as well as the duodenum and skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Moreover, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> arising from the salivary glands appeared to have some of the characteristics of MALT-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> including indolent prognosis, presence of myoepithelial <z:mp ids='MP_0001870'>sialoadenitis</z:mp>, and rarity of the BCL-2 gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
