<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twelve years ago, rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody, became available for the treatment of relapsing follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has resulted in an improvement of approximately 20% in survival for nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, rituximab combined with chemotherapy is indicated as first-line treatment when treatment is necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is also an interesting option, alone or in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of relapses, after verifying the persistence of CD20 expression on the surface of malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a maintenance treatment after chemotherapy with or without rituximab, it improves relapse-free survival and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The standard treatment for high-grade diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, regardless of age and regardless of predicted severity, is now the combination of CHOP chemotherapy and rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combination of fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and rituximab is currently the reference treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005526'>lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> as first-line treatment for patients with few comorbidities and for those with relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The role of this antibody in the treatment of more serious forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is under evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The administration of rituximab, alone or in combination, in the treatment of low-grade non-follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> must be decided as a function of existing protocols in multidisciplinary consultations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>New-generation anti-CD20 antibodies, designed to improve still further the already remarkable efficacy/toxicity ratio, are now taking the road that rituximab opened </plain></SENT>
