<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The goal of this work was to analyze the response rate and outcome of patients with stage I-III follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) treated with radiotherapy (RT) alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of 50 consecutive patients with stage I-III FL treated with RT alone at our department from 1988-2009 were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age was 60 years (range 32-80 years) with a median follow-up duration of 8 years (range 4-11 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical staging was performed according to the Ann Arbor system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stage I: 30 patients (60%), stage II: 15 patients (30%), stage III: 5 patients (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients (64%) presented with nodal disease, 14 patients (28%) presented with disease in extranodal sites, and 4 patients (8%) had nodal and extranodal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The RT field encompassed only the involved Ann Arbor nodal regions (involved-field RT) in 26 patients (52%), mantle and whole abdominopelvic fields in 6 patients (12%), mantle field in 10 patients (20%), whole abdominopelvic fields in 5 patients (10%), and a so-called mini-mantle in 3 patients (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total RT dose ranged from 26-56 Gy (median 40 Gy) in daily fractions of 1.2-2.5 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR) were observed in 39 (76%) and 9 (20%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 2 of 8 patients (25%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> bulk &gt; 5 cm reached CR, whereas 37 of 42 patients (88%) with a maximum <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diameter &lt; 5 cm achieved CR (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival (OS) and median event-free survival (EFS) were 18 years (CI 95% 10-26 years) and 7 years (6-8 years), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 2-, 5-, and 10-year OS were 96 ± 3%, 90 ± 5%, and 70 ± 9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 2-, 5-, and 10-year EFS were 90 ± 5%, 70 ± 7%, and 38 ± 9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients developed a recurrence outside the radiation field (30%) and 4 patients developed an in-field recurrence (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> in-field recurrences were observed in regions without clinical (macroscopic) involvement, which were irradiated with a dose of ≤ 26 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment maximum <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diameter &lt; 5 cm (p = 0.039) and complete remission after RT (p = 0.021) were significantly associated with a better OS in the univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RT is a curative option in the treatment of limited stage FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>If RT of microscopically uninvolved area is necessary, a reduction in the radiation dose should be carefully weighed against the risk of in-field recurrences </plain></SENT>
