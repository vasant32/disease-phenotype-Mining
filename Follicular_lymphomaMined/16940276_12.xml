<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-131 (131I) -rituximab chimeric anti-CD20 antibody radioimmunotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: After a standard loading dose of rituximab 375 mg/m2, individualized dosimetry was performed by whole-body gamma imaging of a tracer activity of 131I-rituximab followed by administration of a therapeutic activity of 131I-rituximab to deliver an estimated whole-body radiation absorbed dose of 0.75 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-one patients were entered onto the trial: 78 patients (86%) had follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, six patients (7%) had mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue/marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and seven patients (8%) had small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective overall response rate (ORR) was 76%, with 53% attaining a complete response (CR) or CR unconfirmed (CRu) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median duration of response for patients achieving CR/CRu was 20 v 7 months for those with a partial response (P = .0121) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival for the entire cohort was 13 months, with 14% remaining relapse free beyond 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 23 months, with a 4-year actuarial survival rate of 59% +/- 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was principally hematologic; grade 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> occurred in 4% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> occurred in 16% of patients, with nadirs at 6 to 7 weeks after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: 131I-rituximab radioimmunotherapy of relapsed or refractory indolent NHL achieves high ORR and CR rates with minimal toxicity </plain></SENT>
