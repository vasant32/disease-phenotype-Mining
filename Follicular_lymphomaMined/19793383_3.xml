<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to analyse the outcome of patients with FL treated with MUD-SCT included in the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>131 patients treated with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC, n = 87) or conventional myeloablative (CONV, n = 44) MUD-SCT between 2000 and 2005 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median time from diagnosis to MUD-SCT was 47 months and the median number of previous therapeutic regimens was 4 (previous autograft: 47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RIC recipients were significantly older, with a longer interval from diagnosis to MUD-SCT and had failed a previous autograft more frequently than CONV recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 24% and 30% at 100-d and 1-year, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 36 months, 17% of the patients developed disease progression, the 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) being 47% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three-year overall survival (OS) for the whole series was 51% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, RIC regimens were associated with at lower NRM and a significantly longer PFS and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study demonstrated that MUD-SCT results, even in heavily pre-treated populations, in a meaningful PFS and OS </plain></SENT>
