<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anderson <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center were searched for patients with WM who underwent biopsy of one or more extramedullary sites during the course of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each biopsy specimen was classified using the criteria of the World Health Organization classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study group consisted of 44 patients (26 men and 18 women), with a total of 51 specimens obtained from lymph nodes (n = 36), soft tissue (n = 4), spleen (n = 3), skin (n = 2), lung (n = 2), tonsils (n = 1), colon (n = 1), liver (n = 1), and gallbladder (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was the most common histologic type, in 40 (78%) samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This category was morphologically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and was further subclassified as lymphoplasmacytic (n = 21), lymphoplasmacytoid (n = 18), and polymorphous (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four of these LPL cases morphologically resembled marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four additional samples were involved by diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, probably transformed from LPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three more samples were involved by LPL with unusual features: two were CD5-positive and one was a composite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> with classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other categories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in this group of patients with WM included small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 2), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 1), and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005508'>Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia</z:hpo> is most commonly associated with LPL but can rarely occur with other types of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in patients with WM is morphologically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and can be indistinguishable from marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CD5+ B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with features otherwise typical of LPL are rare, and we think these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> are part of the spectrum of LPL </plain></SENT>
