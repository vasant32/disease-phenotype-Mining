<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>bcl-2 was originally identified as an oncogene involved in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> as a result of chromosomal translocation (14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is now believed that bcl-2 is implicated in the regulation of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by inhibiting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and that its expression is not restricted to haematopoietic cells, but is also present in many epithelial and mesenchymal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have analysed the expression of this molecule in a variety of non-lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> including lung, breast, prostate, and nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, 50 colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath>, and 142 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, including 25 arising from pre-existing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, were examined using an antibody detecting the bcl-2 protein product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In non-neoplastic mucosa, bcl-2 was expressed in the crypt cells only, whilst the more differentiated surface epithelial cells lacked any demonstrable bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-one of the 50 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (82 per cent) and 48 of the 142 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were positive for bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A reciprocal relationship was found between bcl-2 reactivity and p53 overexpression, as detected by DO7 antibody, in approximately 65 per cent of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2-positive/p53-negative subgroup showed a strong correlation (P = 0.0056) with negative lymph node status (Dukes' A and B), implying a less aggressive pathway of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
