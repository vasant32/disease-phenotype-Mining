<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were investigated using both unifactorial and multivariate regression (Cox model) analyses to determine the relationship of survival rate and prognostic factors including age, sex, histology, B symptom and clinical stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were histologically classified according to the criteria of the working formulation and were staged according to the Ann Arbor classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> occurred roughly 9 times as frequently as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lymph nodes of the neck and inguinal regions were noted to be the most common sites of involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> originated most frequently from the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the proportions of low grade, intermediate grade, and high grade were 10.7%, 59.1% and 20.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining 9.5% of cases were unclassified (7.7%) and true histiocytic (1.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common subtype was diffuse large cell (33.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was found to have a predilection for young male adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> occurred mainly in mid-adult life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patients with high grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> almost always presented the advanced stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median survival time (MST) of our series was 20 months, the 3-year survival rate was 43.3% and the 5-year survival rate was 30.40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Statistical studies of both unifactorial (p less than 0.01) and multivariate regression (p less than 0.05) analyses showed that patients with an age greater than 60 years old, having B symptom, clinically advanced stage, or both histologically intermediate and high grade experienced a much poorer prognosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
