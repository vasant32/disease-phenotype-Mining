<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cell origin of each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was established using a panel of monoclonal antibodies against lymphocyte differentiation antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 41 T-cell, 247 B-cell and 29 undetermined <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and 13 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> in the series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vimentin was expressed in 24 T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (58.5%) and 60 B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (24.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This difference in frequency was statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vimentin expression in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was less frequent than in diffuse B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, small and medium cell types were more reactive with anti-vimentin than large cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reed-Sternberg cells (R-S cells) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> were positive for vimentin in 11 cases (84.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of EMA reactivity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was low, particularly in T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No positive cases were found among follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In diffuse non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, EMA was expressed only in mixed and large cell types, but never in smaller ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, monoclonal antibodies against vimentin and EMA appear to be of limited usefulness for the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, but anti-vimentin antibody may be used as an adjunct to the diagnosis of R-S cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
