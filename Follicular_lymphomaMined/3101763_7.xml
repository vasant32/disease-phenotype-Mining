<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Murine monoclonal anti-idiotype antibody was raised against the surface IgM on the neoplastic cells of a patient with widespread follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For therapy, a chimeric antibody derivative, FabIgG, was constructed by thioether-linking Fab'gamma, from the monoclonal antibody, to human <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FabIgG is univalent and thereby avoids rapid antigenic modulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Its human IgG component is intended to optimize recruitment of effectors and metabolic survival while minimizing immunogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four intravenous (IV) infusions of 380 to 580 mg of anti-idiotype FabIgG were given over a period of 11 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On each occasion, the antibody disappeared from the plasma with a half-life (t1/2) of less than 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The brief survival was evidently due to uptake by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, as infused control FabIgG, containing Fab'gamma from an irrelevant antibody, yielded a plasma t1/2 of greater than 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With each therapeutic infusion, there was a fall in the number of circulating neoplastic cells over a 24-hour period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The numbers were largely replenished over the next week, but a net fall became discernible over the entire period of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four days after each infusion, nodal masses were swollen and tender, subsiding over approximately 8 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At the end of the treatments, the blood lymphocyte count and nodal and splenic swellings continued to subside, so that by 6 weeks a partial remission with removal of greater than 50% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was judged to have occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We did not detect any qualitative change in surface idiotype nor any antibody response to the infused Ig </plain></SENT>
