<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the relative frequency, morphologic features, immunophenotype and clinical data of different types of B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B-NHL) and to evaluate the practical application of the 2001 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 369 documented cases of B-NHL were further subtyped according to the 2001 WHO classification of lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, on the basis of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining, immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Amongst the 369 cases of B-NHL studied, 353 cases could be further classified into 11 subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were the commonest subtypes, accounting for 51.2% (189 cases), 14.9% (55 cases) and 10.6% (39 cases) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> in lymph nodes were seen in 158 cases (42.8%) and in extra node in 211 cases (57.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>B-cell prolymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> were not identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When comparing the diagnosis based on morphologic examination alone with the diagnosis based on both <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunophenotype, there was a 80% concordance rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study was helpful in reaching the correct diagnosis in many cases and could improve the overall diagnostic accuracy by about 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Amongst cases of B-NHL, diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is the commonest subtype, followed by MALToma and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While morphologic examination forms the basis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosis, immunohistochemical study also plays an important role in further subtyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A combination of both modalities are sufficient for arriving at an accurate diagnosis in most cases of B-NHL, in keeping with the recommendation of the 2001 WHO classification of lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
