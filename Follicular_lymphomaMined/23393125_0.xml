<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results are especially limited for second-line HDT with BEAM (BCNU, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> and melphalan) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty patients with FL received ASCT in our institution (18 first-line with total body irradiation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, 34 second-line with BEAM and 8 â‰¥third-line with BEAM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the case of long-term remission (&gt;6 years; N = 17), peripheral blood was tested for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> by t(14;18)- and IGH-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten-year overall survival, progression-free survival and freedom from progression (FFP) after first-line ASCT were 79%, 57% and 64% after second-line ASCT 41%, 35% and 42%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prognostic factors for FFP were treatment line and FLIPI (Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten-year FFP for second-line ASCT and low-risk FLIPI was 57%, intermediate risk 37% and high risk 33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No relapses occurred after 6 years following ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients developed sustained long-term clinical and molecular remissions of up to 17.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Sustained long-term clinical and molecular remissions can be achieved following ASCT, including HDT with BEAM in second line </plain></SENT>
