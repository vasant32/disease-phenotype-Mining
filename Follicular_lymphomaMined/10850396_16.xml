<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study describes the development and validation of a highly sensitive, rapid, accurate, precise enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure Rituximab serum concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study also describes the application of the ELISA method to a pharmacokinetic study in a homogeneous group of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who received 4 weekly doses of MAb at the standard dose of 375 mg/m2 as consolidation of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the patients in this study, the median Rituximab serum concentrations increased during therapy, and showed a slow decline during the posttreatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Rituximab elimination half-life of approximately 20 days accounts for the demonstrated accumulation of MAb in serum samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because previous pharmacokinetic studies showed a correlation between Rituximab serum levels and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response, the ELISA method used in this study, which allows a precise control of serum concentrations, could be useful for predicting the final response to the MAb and for selecting patients able to benefit from higher dosage or repeated drug administration </plain></SENT>
