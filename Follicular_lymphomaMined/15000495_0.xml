<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Existing data suggest that conventional C(H)OP (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>) regimen may not be intensive enough to achieve molecular response, as measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) evidence of translocation (14;18)(q32:q21) for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to study the molecular response rate of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to C(H)OP-based therapy and to analyze prognostic factors for molecular response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with pretreatment PCR evidence of t(14;18)(q32; q21) and at least one posttreatment PCR analysis after the initiation of the treatment with C(H)OP with or without radiation therapy constituted the basis for this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The random effects logistic model was used to analyze the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following factors were investigated for their relationship to molecular response: gender, age, beta2-microglobulin, use of radiation therapy, Ann Arbor stage, and international Prognostic Index for malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median follow-up was 56 months (range, 23-153 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 135 PCR results were available, 33 from bone marrow and 102 from peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, there was a clear and steady decreasing trend toward loss of PCR positivity with increasing time aftertreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By univariate analysis, stage &gt; or = 3, stage = 4, International Prognostic Index &gt; or = 2, and no radiation therapy were adverse factors for molecular response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, Ann Arbor stage IV and no radiation therapy were independent risk factors for PCR positivity, both for the peripheral blood data analyzed alone and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> data combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: It is possible to achieve molecular response with C(H)OP with or without radiation therapy in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Response rate depends on the Ann Arbor stage and radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
