<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report a case of probable bendamustine-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE SUMMARY: A 64-year-old white female had recently received treatment with bendamustine for stage III follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After her fourth cycle, she was admitted to an outside facility with severe right upper quadrant pain across her back and findings consistent with obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She was found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and elevations in total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, alkaline phosphatase, and transaminase levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and presence of megakaryocytes on 2 occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upon transfer to West Virginia University Hospitals, her haptoglobin was found to be undetectable, total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> 10.3 mg/dL (unconjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> 4.9 mg/dL), reticulocyte count 21.4% (reticulocyte index &gt; or = 2%), alkaline phosphatase 1125 U/L, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase 421 U/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The peripheral smear showed evidence of spherocytes and very rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0001981'>schistocytes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, the woman was diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> secondary to bendamustine exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>She was started on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> 1 mg/kg (60 mg) daily and, soon after, her platelets and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> stabilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> is an acquired or extrinsic process that results in antibody-mediated red blood cell destruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient was not taking any medications commonly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>; however, her laboratory test results were consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Based on bendamustine's structural similarity to fludarabine and fludarabine's association with causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, we considered exposure to bendamustine to be the most likely contributory factor for her diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>According to the Naranjo probability scale, a probable likelihood was reflected in bendamustine causing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Continued monitoring of postmarketing data is necessary to correlate this occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> with bendamustine therapy </plain></SENT>
