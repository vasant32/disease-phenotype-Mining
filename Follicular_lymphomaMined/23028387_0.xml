<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Improvements in the classification of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes provide an opportunity to explore associations between environmental exposures and FL incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our paper found that aspects of Western lifestyle including sedentary lifestyle, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and diets high in meat and milk are associated with an increased risk of FL </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genetic risk factors include variants at the 6p21.32 region of the MHC II locus, polymorphisms of the DNA repair gene XRCC3, and UV exposure in individuals with certain polymorphisms of the <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increasing our understanding of risk factors for FL must involve integrating epidemiological studies of genetics and exposures to allow for the examination of risk factors and interactions between genes and environment </plain></SENT>
