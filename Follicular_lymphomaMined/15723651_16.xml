<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The frequency of t(14;18) in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) in Japan has been reported to be low compared to North America and other European countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has also been reported that FL lacks t(14;18), mainly among histological grade 3b, and occasionally has a rearranged Bcl-6 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is not known whether a difference in histology or immunostaining pattern exists between FL with and without t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis to detect Bcl-2/IgH, Bcl-6 gene rearrangement, Bcl-2 gene amplification, and the cyclinD1/IgH gene in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded specimens from our FL archives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlation between morphological features, histological grades, immunohistochemical findings, and cytogenetical aberrations was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In total, we found that 28 of 47 cases (59.6%) had t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bcl-6 gene rearrangement and extra Bcl-2 gene signals were found in five and two cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only one had cyclinD1/IgH fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten of 12 grade 1, nine of 17 grade 2, and 0 of two grade 3 cases had fusion signals, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the above abnormalities were detected in 12 of 47 cases (25.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data confirmed a high frequency of t(14;18) in FL in grade 1, but a lower incidence among grade 2, that could be attributed to the lower incidence of the translocation in FL in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining of both Bcl-2 and CD10 was highly predictable for the presence of t(14;18); the positive predictive value was 75%, suggesting the usefulness of the staining </plain></SENT>
