<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five percent of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> possess a characteristic t(14;18) translocation that results in the deregulated expression of the proto-oncogene BCL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BCL-2 overexpression alone is insufficient for full cellular transformation and at least 1 other genetic event is believed to be necessary for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Deregulated c-Myc expression has previously been shown to cooperate with Bcl-2 to transform murine fibroblast cell lines and lead to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have developed a human model system to study early transformation in lymphoid cells using immortalized lymphoblastoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We sequentially introduced BCL-2 and c-MYC, 2 proto-oncogenes known to be involved in the transformation of B cells into Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-immortalized human B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that the c-Myc and Bcl-2 overexpression, together with EBV immortalization were insufficient to cause full cellular transformation as measured by cell proliferation rates, soft agar and tumorigenicity assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results show that more than 3 genetic hits (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e>, Bcl-2 and c-Myc overexpression) were required for the full cellular transformation of human lymphoblastoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, subtle changes in cellular proliferation and sensitivity to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were documented, at non-limiting dilutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These changes may confer a susceptibility to the modified cells such that they are more susceptible to the acquisition of additional genetic changes and evolve towards a fully transformed state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, the model system developed may be suitable for the identification of further known and novel oncogenic events involved in the full transformation of B cells </plain></SENT>
