<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the results of high-dose chemoradiotherapy and anti-B-cell monoclonal antibody-purged autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) in patients with relapsed indolent follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between March 1985 and May 1995, 153 patients underwent ABMT using a uniform ablative regimen with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and total body irradiation and bone marrow (BM) purging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received multiple chemotherapy regimens before ABMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At BM harvest, only 30% of patients were in complete remission, and overt BM infiltration was present in 47% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) are estimated to be 42% and 66% at 8 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients whose BM was negative by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for bcl2/IgH rearrangement after purging experienced longer freedom from recurrence than those whose BM remained PCR positive (P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Continued PCR negativity in follow-up BM samples was also strongly predictive of continued complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 12-year survival from diagnosis for these 153 patients is 69% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Considering that the median survival from diagnosis and first recurrence of patients with advanced follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are 8 and 5 years, respectively, our results provide evidence that myeloablative therapy and ABMT may prolong overall survival </plain></SENT>
