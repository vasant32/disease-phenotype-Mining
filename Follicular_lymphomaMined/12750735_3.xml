<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two recent studies have shown that retreatment of patients with relapsed indolent NHL with rituximab (RI) can be as effective as primary treatment, provided the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was initially responsive to primary RI therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From the available data, it remains unknown as to whether this approach is also effective for extranodal relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe a 47-year-old male with stage 4B follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), initially also involving skin, who achieved complete remission (CR) after a combination of fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and RI that lasted only 5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He soon relapsed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> and a number of extranodal sites including liver, lungs and bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After retreatment with RI alone (four cycles, 375 mg/m(2)), the patient achieved a second CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another four infusions of RI were given 6 months later as maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The duration of CR is already 18 months longer than the first CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This case illustrates the fact that even in relapsed advanced FL, with multiple sites of extranodal disease, RI given as a single agent may be extremely effective in achieving an additional meaningful complete response </plain></SENT>
