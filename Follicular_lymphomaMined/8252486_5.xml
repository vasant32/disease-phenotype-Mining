<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Only a small percentage of Asian patients with non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> may have follicular type disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to molecular analysis done recently, the incidence of rearrangement of bcl-2 gene in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was lower in Japan than in the United States, suggesting possible geographic or racial differences between Asian and Western populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current study was undertaken to obtain data from Taiwan to compare with data from Japan, Hong Kong, and Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using probes of genomic 5' bcl-2, major breakpoint region (mbr) and minor breakpoint cluster region (mcr) for the breakpoint cluster region of the bcl-2 gene, genomic DNA samples from 55 patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (17 with follicular type and 38 with diffuse type) were analyzed by Southern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven patients had bcl-2 gene rearrangement, including 9 of 17 (52.9%) patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 2 of 38 (5.3%) patients with diffuse B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had the breakpoint located within the mbr, one at both the mbr and the 5' bcl-2 regions, and the other had bcl-2 translocation with involvement of the mcr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA fragment of bcl-2 was found to comigrate with JH genes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who had bcl-2 rearrangement at mbr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining patient who had bcl-2 translocation at mcr had no comigration with JH, Jk, or C lambda genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the low incidence of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Chinese patients, the incidence of bcl-2 gene involvement was higher in patients from Taiwan than in those from Japan and Hong Kong, but similar to the incidence of those from Western countries </plain></SENT>
