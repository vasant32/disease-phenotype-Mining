<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human peripheral blood B cells, secondary lymphoid tissue, and a range of human B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> for the expression of B220 by flow cytometric immunophenotyping and immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that a subset of human B cells in peripheral blood is positive for B220 by flow cytometric immunophenotypic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In reactive lymphoid tissues, B220 is expressed by B cells occupying the mantle zones and by a subpopulation of germinal center cells, but, in contrast, marginal zone B cells in the spleen do not express B220 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 94 cases of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, 33 (35%) were positive for B220 by flow cytometric immunophenotypic analysis, including most cases of marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of precursor B lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were negative for B220 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining for B220 correlated with flow cytometric analysis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases studied by both methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that B220 is expressed in a select subset of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, reactive B cells in a pattern that is consistent with a marker of naive B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, this restricted expression pattern is not seen in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Discordance between the B220 expression patterns of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mantle and marginal zone B cells and their respective neoplastic counterparts may aid in the distinction between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic proliferations at these anatomical sites </plain></SENT>
