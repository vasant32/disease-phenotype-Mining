<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transplantation after whole-body irradiation resulted in the increased "take" rate of three cultured cell lines (two of T-cell-derived <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and one of B-cell derived <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>) and in the tumorous growth of Burkitt-derived Raji and spontaneously transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With splenectomy plus irradiation as a pretreatment, tumorous growth occurred in four other cell lines which were not transplantable after irradiation only (two cell lines of Epstein-Barr virus-transformed cord blood cells and one each of null <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell lines) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>B-cell-derived diffuse large lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was transplantable in three of seven cases (43%) </plain></SENT>
