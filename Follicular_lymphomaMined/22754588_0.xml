<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is the most common form of indolent NHL and the second most common form of NHL overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has morphologic, immunophenotypic and clinical features significantly different from other subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Considerable effort has been devoted to the identification of risk factors for etiology and prognosis of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These risk factors may advance our understanding of the biology of FL and have an impact on clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AREAS COVERED: The epidemiology of NHL and FL is briefly reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For FL etiology and prognosis separately, we review clinical, environmental and molecular (including genetic, genomic, epigenetic and others) risk factors suggested in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EXPERT OPINION: A large number of potential risk factors have been suggested in recent studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there is a lack of consensus, and many of the suggested risk factors have not been rigorously validated in independent studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There is a need for large-scale, prospective studies to consolidate existing findings and discover new risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Some of the identified risk factors are successful at the population level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>More effective individual-level risk factors and models remain to be identified </plain></SENT>
