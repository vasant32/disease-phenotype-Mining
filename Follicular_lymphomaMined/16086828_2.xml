<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We here report three such cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects were a 23-year-old Japanese female, a 44-year-old Japanese female and a 49-year-old Japanese male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients initially presented with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They also had systemic symptoms and abnormal laboratory findings indicating active disease, although two patients did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for SLE at lymph node biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histologically, three lesions were characterized by numerous enlarged, coalescing lymphoid follicles with distortion rather than effacement of the lymph node architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By in situ hybridization, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes were demonstrated in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present three cases indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> associated with SLE representing RFGH should be differentiated from the early stage of HIV-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> as well as follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, particularly the floral variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The authors would like to stress that the RHGF which is described in the present study should be listed in the pathohistology of SLE <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
