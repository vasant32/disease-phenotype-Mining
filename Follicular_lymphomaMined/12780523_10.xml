<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serial sections of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue were stained with antibodies against CD31, CD34 or Factor VIII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using light microscopy and computerised image analysis, the number and size of individual immunostained vessel profiles within a preselected area size range corresponding to capillaries, postcapillary venules, small collecting venules and small arterioles were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significantly larger number of vessels were registered following staining with anti-CD34 than with anti-CD31 or anti-Factor VIII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, among the smallest capillary-sized vessel profiles in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lesion types, there was a selective relative loss of stainability of anti-CD31 and anti-Factor VIII, resulting in a substantial total loss of visualised capillary-sized vessels compared with anti-CD34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In fact, the number of non-detected capillaries following staining with anti-CD31 and anti-Factor VIII was significantly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> type specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings influence how we evaluate MVD data in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and possibly also other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> types, as well as data relating to capillary endothelium-related functional variables of proliferation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and maturation when different double-labelling immunohistochemical techniques are used and different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> types are analysed </plain></SENT>
