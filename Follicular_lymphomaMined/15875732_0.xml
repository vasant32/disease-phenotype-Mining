<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although p53 mutations are less commonly present in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancies</z:e> when compared with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e>, they have been reported in histological transformation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the frequency of p53 gene alterations in paraffin-embedded tissue using commercially available PCR-SSCP, and to correlate the results with P53 protein expression by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Surgical samples from seven patients with a total of 17 sequential biopsies were retrieved for the study of p53 gene expression using immunohistochemical stain, and gene status by PCR-SSCP for exons 5-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were graded according to the WHO classification criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>P53 was distinctly over-expressed in five transformed higher grade biopsies, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except one showed electrophoretic mobility shift in PCR-SSCP analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequencing analysis revealed single nucleotide substitutions in three of four of these high-grade transformed cases with band shift (75%), whereas some other studies reported a lower frequency of 25-30%, and mobility shift result was found to correlate with P53 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lower grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> without P53 over-expression did not demonstrate band shift, and sequencing analysis did not reveal mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the feasibility of adopting PCR-SSCP for screening of p53 mutations in archival tissue samples in this study, and there is a strong correlation of p53 gene over-expression and mutation events in high-grade transformed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
