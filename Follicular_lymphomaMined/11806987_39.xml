<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, the presence of Bcl-2/IgH-positive cells in the peripheral blood (PB) and/or bone marrow (BM) was demonstrated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (n = 128) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who achieved a clinical response following CHOP but remained PCR-positive were eligible for rituximab (375 mg/m(2) intravenously, weekly for 4 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After CHOP, 57% achieved a complete response (CR), 37% a partial response (PR), and 6% were nonresponders (NR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At this stage, patients proving PCR-negative (n = 41) or failing to achieve a clinical response (n = 8) were excluded from rituximab treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven patients received rituximab and entered a scheduled <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> follow-up program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the first molecular follow-up (+12 weeks), 59% had converted to PCR negativity in the BM and PB, with a further increase documented at the second control (+28 weeks) with 74% PCR negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the last molecular follow-up (+44 weeks), 63% of the patients remained PCR negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 3 years, the estimated overall survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients is 95% (95% confidence interval [CI], 86-98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For patients achieving PCR-negative status following CHOP and therefore excluded from rituximab treatment, freedom from recurrence (FFR) was 52% (95% CI, 28-71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For patients treated with rituximab, a durable PCR-negative status was associated with a better clinical outcome since FFR was 57% (95% CI, 23-81) compared with 20% (95% CI, 4-46) in patients who never achieved or lost the molecular negativity (P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
