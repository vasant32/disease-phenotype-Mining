<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous work has shown that this compound has low nanomolar cell-killing activity in a variety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines, many of which overexpress Bcl-2 through a variety of mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">Rapamycin</z:chebi> is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25105">macrolide antibiotic</z:chebi> that inhibits the mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> complex, leading to cell cycle arrest and inhibition of protein translation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">Rapamycin</z:chebi> (and its analogues) has shown activity in a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines primarily through induction of cell cycle arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Activity has also been shown clinically in mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that treatment of the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines DoHH-2 and SuDHL-4 with 100 nmol/L <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> induces substantial G(0)-G(1) arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Addition of as little as 39 nmol/L <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>-263 to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> regimen induced a 3-fold increase in sub-G(0) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combination of these agents also led to a significant increase in Annexin V staining over <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>-263 alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft models</z:e> of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> induced a largely <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> response in the DoHH-2 and SuDHL-4 models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Coadministration with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>-263 induced significant <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp>, with DoHH-2 and SuDHL-4 tumors showing 100% overall response rates </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that combination of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>-263 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> or its analogues represents a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
