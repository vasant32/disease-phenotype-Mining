<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, accumulation of MCs in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) correlates with unfavourable prognosis after immunochemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> vascularity is associated with MC content and outcome in FL patients treated with immunochemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Microvessel density (MVD) and MC content were determined immunohistochemically from pretreatment samples of 95 FL patients using CD31, CD34 and mast cell tryptase antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene expression data from a separate set of 24 FL patients were analysed for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with the combination of rituximab (R) and cyclophoshamide-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHOP) chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increased CD31+ MVD correlated positively with the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> infiltrating MCs and CD34+ vessels, and negatively with the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall survival and progression-free survival were significantly better among patients with low CD31+ MVDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, CD31+ MVD had prognostic value independently of Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Prognostic Index but not of MC content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the immunohistochemical data, high CD31/PECAM1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were associated with adverse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conversely, a positive prognostic impact of VEGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression on the outcome was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Vascularity is associated with MC content and outcome in R-CHOP-treated FL patients </plain></SENT>
