<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of the translocation was 76% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetics was the most successful technique, but 10-30% of translocations detected karyotypically were missed by molecular methods, presumably due to break-points falling outside the range of probes and primers used here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reliance on molecular detection alone may considerably underestimate the incidence of t(14;18) and it is therefore essential to use the most comprehensive range of probes and primers available </plain></SENT>
