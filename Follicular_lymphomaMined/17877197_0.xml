<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The deposition of C4d was detected in samples from 133 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> by immunohistochemistry and FL was studied by the double stainings of CD35/C4d, CD21/C4d and Bcl-2/C4d,respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 26 FL tissues, irregular C4d deposition was seen in 19 tumor tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Double staining for CD35, CD21 or Bcl-2 showed the C4d deposition was around the follicular dendritic cells (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the positive rate of C4d and the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No deposition was found in the diffuse areas of FL and other type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: C4d deposition around the follicular dendritic cell in the neoplastic follicles is a specific indicator of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
