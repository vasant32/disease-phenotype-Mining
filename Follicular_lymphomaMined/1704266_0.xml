<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported an anti-transferrin receptor antibody, Trump, which was originally selected for its ability to discriminate low- and high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This feature was distinct from the other anti-transferrin receptor antibodies such as OKT9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, further immunochemical analysis was performed to define the nature of the antigenic site recognized by the Trump antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Trump was found to block the binding of transferrin both to solubilized and to surface transferrin receptors; conversely, transferrin could block the binding of Trump only to surface transferrin receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> recognized by Trump is near but not identical to the transferrin binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes with phytohemagglutinin induced both the OKT9 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> and the Trump <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>, but 12-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> 13 myristate <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> induced only the OKT9 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Growth of some cell lines was inhibited by Trump but not by OKT9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No structural difference was found between transferrin receptor molecules reactive with Trump and those reactive with OKT9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In support of these results, Trump was able to immunoprecipitate transferrin receptor molecules solubilized from low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells even though it did not bind to the receptors exposed on the surface of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings imply that low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells differ from high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells not in the structures of their transferrin receptors but in their exposure of the molecule on the cell surface </plain></SENT>
