<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bone marrow and peripheral-blood samples from 28 newly diagnosed patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> referred from several different medical centers were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Routine morphologic assessment was performed initially and the remainder of the sample was aliquoted for DNA extraction to be used for gene rearrangement and PCR analyses and for immunophenotypic and cytogenetic analyses where a sufficient amount of sample remained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Morphologic assessment of the bone marrow was positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in 11 of 28 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PCR amplification of t(14;18) breakpoint DNA detected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in 17 of 24 patients assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Morphologic assessment detected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in three bone marrow samples that were negative by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PCR analysis was the only method able to detect circulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in peripheral blood at diagnosis and was positive in 15 of 24 samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other methods of assessment did not show <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in any samples in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was not detected by morphologic or PCR analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were found in the bone marrow and/or peripheral blood as frequently in early-stage patients as in advanced-stage patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PCR amplification of t(14;18) breakpoint DNA together with morphologic assessment had the highest yield of detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in the bone marrow and/or peripheral blood of our population of newly diagnosed patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance and prognostic importance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells detected by PCR in the bone marrow and/or peripheral blood of newly diagnosed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients awaits long-term follow-up data of these and additional patients </plain></SENT>
