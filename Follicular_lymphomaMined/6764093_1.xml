<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rate of accurate cytological diagnoses were 73% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 300 cases, and 64% of 100 cases of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of cytological diagnosis of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> by the histologic types was the highest in diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, relatively low in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and the lowest in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Imprints of lymph node biopsies from 20 cases of diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, large cell type of the LSG classification were obtained at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By their differential cell counts the value of large lymphoid cells was 72 (33 to 98)% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the patients with less than 75% of large lymphoid cells in imprints of lymph nodes seemed to tend to have disseminated disease at the time of diagnosis and leukemic manifestation at the last stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Imprints of lymph node biopsies from 15 cases of diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, pleomorphic type of the LSG classification at the time of diagnosis revealed large lymphoid cells of 41 (2-86)% and prolymphocytes of 41 (3-90)% by the differential cell counts of the imprints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with more than 50% of large lymphoid cells were frequently suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo> and had advanced stages at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They had poor responses to therapies resulted in unfavorable prognoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it was suspected that the cytological findings of lymph nodes in patients with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of these types might be correlate to the clinical features and the prognosis </plain></SENT>
