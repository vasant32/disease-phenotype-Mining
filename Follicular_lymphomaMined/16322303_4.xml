<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Fludarabine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> is an effective combination but increases the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">opportunistic infections</z:e> due to depressed lymphocyte counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to preserve CD4 counts, we conducted a phase I, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) added to fludarabine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> in patients with treatment-naive indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Subcutaneous IL-2 (days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle) was combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (600 mg/m2, day 8) and fludarabine (20 mg/m2, days 8-12) at four dose levels: 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.4 x 10(6) IU/m2/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IL-2 dose was escalated in cohorts of four to six patients, with one patient per cohort receiving placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-three patients, median age 50, were enrolled, of whom 30% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 52% had follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The combination was generally well tolerated, with mainly hematologic toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD4 counts typically declined substantially during the early weeks of treatment and remained suppressed for months afterward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 18 evaluable patients who received IL-2, the mean absolute CD4 count was 999 cells/microL (range, 97-3,776) pretreatment, 379 cells/microL (range, 54-2,599) at day 14, and 98 cells/microL (range, 17-291) at end of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In longitudinal linear models, the changes in CD4 counts were not significantly different across IL-2 dose levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The addition of low-dose IL-2 to fludarabine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> does not seem immunoprotective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>New approaches are needed to reduce the cellular immunosuppression and infectious complications associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> analogues </plain></SENT>
