<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The tolerability and activity of the intralesional administration of rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 antigen, was assessed in patients with conjunctival B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The systemic administration of rituximab has varying response rates with different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, generally with a mild toxicity level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intralesional administration of this drug has increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">local disease</z:e> control in cases of cutaneous mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This was an interventional pilot study of 3 patients with relapsed CD20+ conjunctival <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> treated with intralesional injections of rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Two patients with conjunctival MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> refractory to previous systemic treatment with rituximab and 1 patient with relapsed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the eyelid were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients received 4 weekly intralesional injections followed by 6 monthly injections of undiluted rituximab together with xylocaine 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Side effects and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response were assessed before each intralesional injection and at 3-month intervals after treatment conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 2 conjunctival MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients achieved complete remission after intraconjunctival rituximab treatment, which shows that this method of administration can overcome the primary resistance to this monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient with the eyelid follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> did not achieve <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> after the first intralesional injections of rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this patient, the addition of autologous serum resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> remission at the end of treatment, suggesting that drug inefficacy can be related to the low bioavailability of effectors in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although follow-up is still short, these preliminary findings suggest that intralesional rituximab is a well-tolerated strategy in marginal-zone and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the conjunctiva </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An increased bioavailability of effectors in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue, by means of the addition of autologous serum, may improve rituximab activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This strategy could be used in other extranodal CD20+ indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> to improve local control, even in patients who are initially refractory to systemic rituximab treatment </plain></SENT>
