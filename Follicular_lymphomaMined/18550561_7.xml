<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Associations between reproductive hormonal factors and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL and of two predominant subtypes, diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL) (n = 233) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 173), were investigated among women (n = 581) in a large, population-based, case-control study (1,591 cases, 2,515 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Controls (n = 836) identified by random digit dialing were frequency matched by age and county to incident NHL cases ascertained in the San Francisco Bay Area of California in 1988-1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adjusted unconditional logistic regression was used to obtain odds ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More than four pregnancies indicated a possible lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL (odds ratio (OR) = 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.55, 1.2; p-trend = 0.06) and of DLCL (OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.31, 0.90; p-trend = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exclusive use of menopausal hormone therapy for &gt; or =5 years was associated with a reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.48, 0.98) and of DLCL (OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.30, 0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Oral contraceptive use indicated a lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.49, 0.94), and perhaps DLCL (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.51, 1.2), and of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.46, 1.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that endogenous and exogenous reproductive hormones confer different risks by NHL subtype and are associated with a reduced risk of DLCL in women </plain></SENT>
