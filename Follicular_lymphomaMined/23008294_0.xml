<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) registered in the F2-study and initially managed without treatment were analyzed to describe the presentation and outcome of a watch and wait (W&amp;W) strategy in the rituximab era, to identify parameters for initiating treatment, and to evaluate whether initial W&amp;W could have deleterious effects on treatment efficacy after progression or relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2003 and 2005, 120 patients selected from the 1,093 treatment-naive patients with FL in the F2-study cohort were initially managed expectantly (W&amp;W), and 107 patients were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of these patients (80%) had disseminated disease with a low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden according to <z:chebi fb="98" ids="24433">Groupe</z:chebi> d'Etudes des Lymphomes Folliculaires criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 64 months, treatment was initiated in 54 patients (50%), with a median delay of 55 months for the entire cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a univariate analysis, involvement of more than four nodal areas (hazard ratio [HR], 2.26) and serum albumin less than 3.5 g/dL (HR, 3.51) were predictive of a shorter time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treatment initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, only involvement of more than four nodal areas remained significant (HR, 2.32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 4-year freedom from treatment failure (FFTF) rate of W&amp;W patients (79%; 95% CI, 69% to 85%) was not inferior to that of a subgroup of 242 patients from the F2-study cohort with good prognosis characteristics who were initially treated with a rituximab-based regimen (69%; 95% CI, 61% to 76%; P = .103) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the rituximab era, patients with FL in a selected prognostically favorable group can still be managed with W&amp;W </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>W&amp;W does not seem to have detrimental effects on FFTF and overall survival rates after treatment </plain></SENT>
