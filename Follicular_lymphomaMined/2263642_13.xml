<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The isolation of the intact gene would provide an essential substrate to analyze the molecular basis of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis suggested that this three-exon gene was several hundred kilobases (kb) long </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a library of yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones was screened to isolate the intact BCL2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two clones, yA85B6 (200 kb) and yB206A6 (700 kb), were isolated by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays specific for exon I/II and exon III, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, neither YAC contained the entire BCL2 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since the two YACs were found to overlap by 60 kb, we sought to take advantage of the high recombination frequency in yeast and induce physical recombination between the two clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cells containing each YAC were mated and induced to undergo meiotic division and sporulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the resulting tetrads revealed a spore containing a single recombinant YAC of 800 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PCR assays and Southern blotting demonstrated that this recombined YAC contained the entire approximately 230-kb BCL2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, probe order was conserved and there was no evidence of overt rearrangements or deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate the feasibility of reconstructing large genomic segments with overlapping YAC clones to study genes spanning hundreds of kilobases </plain></SENT>
