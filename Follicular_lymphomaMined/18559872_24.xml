<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The treatment of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has changed with the introduction of high-dose therapy (HDT) with autologous stem-cell transplant then with rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of these two strategies on the outcome of relapsing patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has never been compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed two cohorts of patients treated in two successive randomized studies with the same treatment, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, teniposide, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> plus interferon, to evaluate the role of rituximab and HDT in salvage therapy after first disease progression or relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 364 patients included in these two studies, 254 progressed or relapsed and constitute the population of this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among them, 98 had been treated with HDT, including 33 of them after rituximab-containing salvage regimen, and 69 with rituximab alone or combined with chemotherapy but without HDT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients' characteristics at diagnosis were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If event-free survival was identical for patients treated within <z:chebi fb="98" ids="24433">Groupe</z:chebi> d'Etude des Lymphomes Folliculaires (GELF) -86 or GELF-94 studies, overall survival was longer in GELF-94 study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HDT was associated with a statistically significant benefit in terms of event-free survival from relapse and survival after relapse (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SAR</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rituximab was associated with a greater benefit than HDT for these two end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When both treatments were combined, patients treated with rituximab-containing salvage regimen followed by HDT had 5-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SAR</z:e> more than 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, for patients treated with first-line chemotherapy the combination of a salvage regimen containing rituximab with or without HDT leads to a dramatic improvement of long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
