<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To correlate cytogenetic findings with histology and immunophenotype, 260 newly diagnosed patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and 31 with adult T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ATL) were studied at the Fifth International Workshop on Chromosomes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clonal chromosome abnormalities were found in 85% of cases of NHL and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of ATL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most significant associations of histology with cytogenetics involved the 8q24 and 14;18 translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 23 NHL patients with an 8q24 translocation, 20 (87%) had small noncleaved cell (SNC) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 57 NHL patients with a t(14;18)(q32;q21), 37 (65%) had a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and at least 13 others (23%) had a diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of follicular center cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five others including two who also had an 8q24 translocation had SNC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in these patients lacked the monomorphic features seen in those with only an 8q24 translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most striking associations of immunology with cytogenetics involved rearrangements of 14q11-13, abnormalities of 1p, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 3, and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities of 14q11-13 were correlated with T cell disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 138 NHL and 24 ATL cases that lacked involvement of 8q24, t(14;18), or rearrangements of 14q11-13, abnormalities of 1p and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 3 were significantly associated with the T <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> (P less than .01) and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 12 with the B <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> (P less than .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No karyotype difference was found between Japanese ATL and non-Japanese T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> except that +3 occurred more often in the former (P = .06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the 8q24 translocations in 23 patients were distributed relatively equally among geographic regions (United States, ten; Europe, ten; Japan, three), the t(14;18) in 57 patients was much less frequently seen in Japan than in the other parts of the world (United States, 31; Europe, 21; Australia, four; Japan, one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine chromosome bands had breaks in five or more cases; a number of protooncogenes and genes related to lymphocyte function located in these bands are likely to be involved in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, besides confirming the close association of particular chromosome abnormalities with histology, we have identified a number of new associations that merit molecular analysis </plain></SENT>
