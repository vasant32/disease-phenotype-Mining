<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three observational studies were conducted to assess the benefit of Allo-SCT in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two statistical analyses were performed: the propensity score (PS) matching approach and the inverse probability weighting (IPW) approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on PS-matched samples, a survival benefit in MM patients treated by Allo-SCT, as compared to similar non-allo treated patients, was observed with an HR of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 0.35 (95%CI: 0.14-0.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar results were observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>, 0.23 (0.07-0.80) but not in FL, 1.28 (0.43-3.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Estimated benefits of Allo-SCT for the original population using IPW were erased in HR for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 0.72 (0.37-1.39) for MM patients, 0.60 (0.19-1.89) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> patients, and 2.02 (0.88-4.66) for FL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Differences in estimated benefits rely on whether the underlying population to which they apply is an ideal randomized experimental population (PS) or the original population (IPW) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These useful methods should be employed when assessing the effects of innovative treatment in non-randomized experiments </plain></SENT>
