<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phenotypically, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were CD5(-), CD10(+), CD19(+), CD20(+), CD23(-), HLA-DR(+), and IgM-lambda(+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conventional chromosomal analysis showed a three-way t(3;14;18)(q27;q32;q21) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, which was confirmed by spectral karyotyping (SKY) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed that both BCL2 and BCL6 proteins were expressed in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, whereas only the BCL6 gene, and not the BCL2 gene, was rearranged by Southern blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient received combination chemotherapy and has been well for 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is the first reported case showing a three-way translocation involving 2 major <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-specific abnormalities, 3q27 and t(14;18)(q32;q21) </plain></SENT>
