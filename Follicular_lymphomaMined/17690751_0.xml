<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) is the first radioimmunotherapy agent approved for the treatment of relapsed and resistant follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Long-term benefit was observed especially for patients achieving CR after radioimmunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A 65-year-old female patient with the second relapse of CD20 positive follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and multiple concomitant diseases was treated with four weekly doses of rituximab (375 mg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(18)F-fluoro-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET-CT) demonstrated only partial response to therapy with persistent PET scan positivity in enlarged abdominal lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it was decided to treat her with a 1200-MBq (32-mCi) dose of (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan radioimmunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> complications were noted afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hematological nadirs were reached 4 weeks later, with a platelet count of 24 x 10(9)/l that normalized within the next 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient had neither <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> nor <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight weeks after radioimmunotherapy, the PET-CT scans documented only 3 lymph nodes around the abdominal aorta, maximum size 2 x 1 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The PET scan analysis proved no accumulation of (18)F-fluoro-deoxy-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in any lymph nodes or other organs and tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sequential treatment with rituximab and (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan may be an interesting alternative in cases of relapsed follicular or other indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in pretreated or older patients with other concomitant diseases </plain></SENT>
