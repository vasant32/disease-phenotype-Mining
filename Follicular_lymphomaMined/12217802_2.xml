<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The translocation induces the overexpression of the Bcl-2 protein and prolongs the survival of clonogenic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> cells may acquire additional molecular alterations that may be associated with histologic progression or with chemo-resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the distribution and association of bcl-6 and p53 mutations in 55 consecutive bcl-2/Jh+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples derived from 43 patients obtained at the time of diagnosis and, in 5 of these patients, during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 29 bcl-6 point mutations were detected in seventeen patients (40%) associated with major or minor breakpoints of the bcl-2/Jh fusion gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In seven cases a p53 mutation was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three cases corresponded to FL with the minor breakpoint in the bcl-2 gene and these patients had a favorable clinical evolution, whereas the 4 patients with p53 mutations and the major breakpoint had a bad clinical outcome with morphologic transformation to high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sequential analysis of 5 patients showed a different timing in the acquisition of mutations: one patient showed bcl-6 and p53 mutations at diagnosis, another patient showed bcl-6 mutations at diagnosis and acquired a p53 mutation later whereas the third patient had a p53 mutation before the appearance of the bcl-6 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We did not find significant differences in survival between patients with FL who showed exclusively bcl-6 mutations and those without bcl-6 mutations, but those patients with a high International Progostic Index score and p53 mutations showed the lowest overall survival (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that bcl-2/Jh <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> show molecular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> and that bcl-6 and p53 mutations may be acquired during the evolution of such <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bcl-6 mutations, by themselves, do not seem to be associated with a bad prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Rearrangements at the minor bcl-2 locus may have a different molecular evolution </plain></SENT>
