<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We established the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines HF-1.3.4 and HF-4-9 from two patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both cell lines carry the characteristic t(14;18) chromosomal translocation and display constitutively overexpressed Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HF-1.3.4 represents a mature B cell with sIgG and several somatic hypermutations in its Ig genes, while HF-4-9 is a less mature B cell, expressing sIgM and only a few mutations in its Ig genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cross-linking of sIg with antibodies leads to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in HF-1.3.4 cells but not in HF-4-9 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Triggering of sIg induced, within seconds, identical tyrosine phosphorylation of p53/56lyn protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) and p55blk PTK in both of the cell lines; however, a prominent tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of p72syk PTK only in HF-1.3.4 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that p72syk PTK is of importance in relaying apoptotic signalling upon sIg cross-linking in the HF-1.3.4 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Given the mature phenotype of the HF-1.3.4 cell line it serves as a model for the late negative selection during B cell ontogeny </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our results question the current concept that a constitutive overexpression of BcI-2 confers resistance to sIg ligation-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
