<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FL is generally considered to be incurable, and is characterized by periods of remission followed by episodes of relapse, with median survival of 8-10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Maintenance treatment is aimed at improving quality of life and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To review the current evidence for maintenance rituximab in patients with FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EVIDENCE REVIEW: Two randomized studies of rituximab maintenance or observation after induction therapy with single-agent rituximab, which were performed mainly in patients with relapsed/refractory disease, have demonstrated a two- to three-fold improvement in median progression-free survival (PFS) in the maintenance arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two further studies of rituximab maintenance or observation following induction chemotherapy with or without rituximab performed in patients with relapsed/refractory FL have shown a two- to four-fold increase in median PFS in the maintenance arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one of these studies an overall survival benefit has also been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An additional study, this time in previously untreated patients, has demonstrated a four-fold improvement in median PFS as well as a significant overall survival benefit with rituximab maintenance following induction with chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PLACE IN THERAPY: Currently rituximab maintenance can be considered to be appropriate therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory disease who have not received rituximab previously and who are not suitable for autologous stem cell transplantation, and for patients who receive first-line therapy with chemotherapy without rituximab </plain></SENT>
