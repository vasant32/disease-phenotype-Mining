<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study analysed 126 patients with relapsed, advanced stage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who received BEAM (BCNU [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="3423">carmustine</z:chebi>], <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, melphalan)-alemtuzumab allogeneic HSCT (BEAM-allo) (n = 44) or BEAM-autologous HSCT (BEAM-auto) (n = 82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The BEAM-allo group had a younger median age (48 years vs. 56 years, P &lt; 0.001) but received a higher median number of therapies pretransplant (P = 0.015) compared with the BEAM-auto group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a higher non-relapse mortality (NRM) in the BEAM-allo group compared with the BEAM-auto group at 1 year (20% vs. 2%, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Older age and heavily pretreated patients were associated with a higher NRM and poorer survival in the BEAM-allo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was, however, a significantly lower relapse rate (20% vs. 43%, P = 0.01) at 3 years with BEAM-alemtuzumab, with no relapses after 2 years, compared with a continued pattern of relapse in the autologous group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No difference in overall survival (OS) (P = 0.99) or disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.90) was identified at 3 years, whereas a plateau in OS and DFS with crossing of the survival curves in favour of BEAM-allo group was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the ability to re-induce remissions with donor leucocytes provides additional benefit in favour of allogeneic HSCT </plain></SENT>
