<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a few reports have suggested that some are follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) or mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analysed 35 patients and clarified the clinicopathological features of LP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Paraffin-embedded tissue samples were stained immunohistochemically and analysed by tissue-fluorescence in situ hybridization (T-FISH) for IGH/CCND1 (cyclin D1) and IGH/BCL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average age of the patients was 58.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over half of the cases showed gastric, duodenal, small intestinal, ileocaecal and sigmoid colonic lesions (15, 19, 15, 16 and 16 cases, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Phenotypically, cases were classified into three types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> (cyclin D1+ CD5+ CD10-) (n=12), FL (cyclin D1- CD5- CD10+) (n=14) and MALT (cyclin D1- CD5- CD10-) (n=9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>T-FISH identified 11 of the 11 examined cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCLs</z:e> to have IGH/CCND1, while seven of 10 cases with FL had IGH/BCL2, and none of the MALT cases were positive for IGH/CCND1 or IGH/BCL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the study endpoint, five of 12 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> were dead, two of 14 with FL and one of nine with MALT were dead of other disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival analysis showed significantly poorest outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, followed by FL, while MALT was associated with a favourable outcome (P=0.0040) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study emphasizes the importance of differentiating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, FL and MALT of LP in evaluating prognosis and hence the most suitable therapeutic regimen </plain></SENT>
