<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, predictors of response to rituximab have not been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics for 166 NHL patients (130 follicular) in a phase III trial of rituximab were analysed by univariate and multivariate methods to determine whether any of 27 factors predict response and/or response duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a univariate analysis, response to rituximab was associated with follicular histology, no prior fludarabine therapy, prior autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT), lack of bone marrow involvement or extranodal disease, positive bcl-2 in blood, and fewer relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By univariate analysis, longer median time to progression (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) and/or duration of response (DR) after rituximab therapy was associated with International Prognostic Index lower-risk group, multiagent chemotherapy, and low/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) or beta2 microglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, response to rituximab correlated with follicular histology, prior ABMT, multiagent chemotherapy, and no bone marrow involvement; longer <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> and/or DR correlated with low/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum LDH or beta2 microglobulin, high CD3+ cells, and response to last chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> international prognostic index (FLIPI) did not correlate consistently with response to rituximab or response duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several factors associated with prognosis following chemotherapy did not correlate with response to rituximab or response duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NHL patients can respond to rituximab despite having factors associated with a poor outcome to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
