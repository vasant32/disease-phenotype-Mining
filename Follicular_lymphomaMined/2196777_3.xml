<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven lymph node aspirates were identified for which histologic confirmation of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was subsequently obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen aspirates interpreted as reactive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> aspirates were studied by immunoperoxidase on cytospin preparations with the use of antibodies DRC1, kappa, lambda, CD3, CD5, and CD20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> could not be identified reliably by morphologic examination of aspirate smears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clusters of DRC1-positive (DRC1+) cells were present in seven of seven follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, one of one mantle zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and one of seven small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rare DRC1+ cells were present in one of one diffuse mixed and one of seven large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One lymphoblastic, one Burkitt's, and two diffuse small cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had no DRC1+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the seven follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was CD5 positive (CD5+), whereas five of the seven small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were CD5+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were CD20-positive (CD20+), but only one of seven small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was CD20+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nineteen of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 of the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, were either kappa or lambda positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The other eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were T-cell (1), B-cell (1), true histiocytic (1), or "null" cell (5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The reactive aspirates had both kappa- and lambda-positive B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seven of the 15 had clusters of DRC1+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>To further evaluate these antibodies, the authors studied 29 additional, surgically biopsied, non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that had not been aspirated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained, except that three of five diffuse small cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had DRC1+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>DRC1, in conjunction with antibodies to CD5, CD20, kappa, and lambda, helps to distinguish follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>DRC1 is not useful in separating reactive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
