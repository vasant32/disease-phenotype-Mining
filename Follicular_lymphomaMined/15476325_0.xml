<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The target gene <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was amplified with RT-PCR, then was sequentially electrophoresed and purified as standards, and the standard curves of gene expression were established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of TRF2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of lymphoid tissue from NHL and reactive lymphoadenopathy were detected with real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The correlation coefficient was 0.996 between the amount of template cDNA and the intensity of fluorescence signal when gene expression standard curves were established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlation coefficient of template cDNA amount and grey density of bands derived from gel electrophoresis of real-time RT-PCR final products was 0.779 (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL patients, expression levels of TRF2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were(22.943 +/-9.424) amol, (23.181 +/-5.983) amol and (18.339 +/-7.910) amol, respectively, which had no significant difference compared with reactive lymphoadenopathy [(21.796 +/-4.800) amol, P&gt;0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression level of TRF2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was (33.170 +/-12.841) amol, which was significantly higher than that of reactive lymphoadenopathy and other types of NHL (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Alcohol drinking isn't one of the risk factors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> among Jiashan County population </plain></SENT>
