<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only small number of studies concerning NHL and DNA reparation gene polymorphisms has been performed so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, we have assessed the effect of 4 selected polymorphisms with possible influence on risk of FL development in a case-control study in Slovak population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have genotyped polymorphisms in the RAG1 (K820R), LIG4 (T9I), BRCA2 (N372H), and WRN (V114I) genes in 108 patients with histologically proven FL diagnosis and 127 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For discrimination between the allelic variants, we have established the genotyping by real-time melting analysis of an unlabeled probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most notable finding was related to polymorphism N372H in the BRCA2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> genotype (NN), the homozygous variant genotype (HH) was associated with an increased FL risk (OR = 2.91, 95% CI: 0.96-8.81), although on the borderline of statistical significance (P = 0.050) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, after stratification by gender and age, the FL risk was significantly increased in men with variant-containing genotypes (OR = 2.79, 95% CI: 1.20-6.45) and even severalfold significantly increased among men with homozygous variant BRCA2 genotype (OR = 21.18, 95% CI: 2.46-182.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant associations with FL risk were identified for other polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
