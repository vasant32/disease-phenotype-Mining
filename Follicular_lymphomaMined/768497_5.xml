<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three canine malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were studied to correlate morphologic and immunologic properties of the neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Morphotologic characterization included histologic classification of cell type and growth pattern, anatomic distribution of lesions, and transmission electron microscopic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Parameters examined to indicate B- or T-cell nature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells included demonstration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> responsiveness, cell-surface Ig, spontaneous rosette formation with human red blood cells, and scanning electron microscope (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) examination of cell-surface features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results indicated that the cells from histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were lymphocytes rather than histiocytes or macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> examined possessed cell-surface ig, indicating B-cell nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cell types represented by the different Ig-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were compatible with maturation arrest at different stages in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocyte differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the two most common histiologic cell types, nitogen responsiveness and the presence of cell-surface Ig indicated that diffuse, poorly differentiated lymphocytic cases were biologically heterogenous, whereas nodular histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were biologically homogenous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most canine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had a multicentric anatomic distribution; however, one thymic and two alimentary forms were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphomas</z:hpo> with a nodular pattern in lymph nodes had multifocal splenic involvement centered on small arteries, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with a diffuse pattern in lymph nodes had diffuse involvement of splenic white pulp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cells of Ig-positive and Ig-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> examined by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> were predominantly of the smooth-cell type </plain></SENT>
