<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the apoptotic effect of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and related mechanism induced by YM155 in vitro and provide laboratory rationales for the clinical treatment of follicular of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with YM155 in the future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SUDHL-4 cells were cultured to logarithmic phase and transferred to 96-well plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were a series of YM155 concentration gradients: 100, 10, 1, 0.1 and 0 ng/ml and cultured for 24, 48 and 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the addition of CCK-8 reagent for 2 h at each time point, optical density values were obtained from the cell growth inhibition curves depending on time and drug concentration and the half growth inhibition concentration (IC(50)) values calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUDHL-4 cells were co-cultured with YM155 (1 ng/ml) for 0, 24, 48 and 72 h respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then flow cytometry (FCM) was used to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SUDHL-4 cell line was treated with YM155 for 24 and 48 h to extract the total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of bcl-2, bcl-xl, bid, bax and survivin gene at the time point of 48 h and the survivin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression at 24 h were detected by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The protein expressions of survivin, caspase-9, cleaved caspase-9, caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3 were detected at each time point with Western blot respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SUDHL-4 cell line showed significant growth inhibition effect depending on time and dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>And the 24, 48, 72 h IC(50) was 6.1, 2.7 and 1.2 ng/ml respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SUDHL-4 cells stained AnnexinV-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> and PI examined by FCM demonstrated that the proportion of AnnexinV-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> positive cells gradually increased with time (17.3% ± 2.1%, 35.7% ± 3.3%, 54.6% ± 4.3% vs 2.1% ± 0.3%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>And the results of real-time fluorescent PCR proved that YM155 decreased the expression of survivin gene obviously (24 h: 0.72 ± 0.02, 48 h: 0.56 ± 0.01 vs 1.00, both P &lt; 0.05) but had little effects on the gene expressions of bax, bid, bcl-2 and bcl-xl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The Western blot results further confirmed that the protein expressions of survivin and caspase-3 decreased with time while caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-9 showed no obvious changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>But cleaved caspase-3 increased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: YM155 displays significant apoptotic effects in SUDHL-4 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The mechanism may be the direct activation of caspase-3 through the down-regulation of survivin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>And the apoptotic pathway is probably not regulated by bcl-2 family </plain></SENT>
