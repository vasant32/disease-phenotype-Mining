<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Seventy-one of 99 patients who received high-dose therapy commenced the surveillance program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Response duration, time to next treatment and overall survival were compared according to whether disease progression had been diagnosed on the basis of surveillance investigations or on clinical grounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 16 years, progression was documented by surveillance in 16 patients and clinically in 18, the median response duration being 2.4 and 2.3 years, respectively (P=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with a relapse detected clinically started treatment immediately, contrasting with one patient whose relapse was detected by surveillance investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients with relapses detected by surveillance investigations have not required treatment after a median follow-up of 18 years, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two patients with a relapse detected clinically have been treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median time to next treatment was 7 years for patients with a relapse identified by surveillance investigations and 4 years for those whose relapse was manifested clinically (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was not significantly different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance investigations, consisting of annual computed tomography scanning and bone marrow biopsies, have no impact on the management of patients with recurrent follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and do not improve the outcome of these patients </plain></SENT>
