<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Subjects consisted of 35 extranodal marginal-zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type, 75 diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), 14 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 17 extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, nasal type, eight unclassified peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, four anaplastic large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, T/null cell type, and five others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>59 patients received radiotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>98 patients received CHOP, modified CHOP, or more intensive chemotherapy, and six patients were treated with other combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No patients with MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had in-field local recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no recurrences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> patients who received chemotherapy in which the doses of adriamycin were &gt; 200 mg/m(2), nor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> patients who were treated with &gt; 45 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only nine of 15 patients with T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated with &lt; or = 50 Gy and three of five patients treated with &gt; 50 Gy had local control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The dose of adriamycin had no influence on local control of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: T/NK-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were more radioresistant than B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prognosis for peripheral T/NK-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is poor even when treated by irradiation combined with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
