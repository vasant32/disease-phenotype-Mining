<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied a distinct cohort of FLs with a 3q27/BCL-6 gene rearrangement, but lacking the t(14;18) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 13/15 cases, translocations involved the 3q27 and the 14q32 regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases displayed a marked follicular growth pattern and, in some instances, a monocytoid component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> cells were CD5(-) CD20(+) CD23(-) CD43(-) BCL-6(+), and in the main CD10 negative (n = 10, 71%) and BCL-2 negative (n = 11, 78%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When compared to 20 typical t(14;18)(+) FLs, the presence of large follicles (P = 0.01) and a CD10(-)/BCL-2(-) phenotype were more frequently observed (P = 0.001) in our cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clonal mutations arising in the BCL-6 first intron were observed in 5/7 cases with evidence of intraclonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, consistent with a germinal center origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found in comparison to t(14;18)(+) FL regarding age, sex, performance status, bone marrow involvement or overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in the 3q27(+) FL group, a stage III/IV disease and a bulky mass were less frequently observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that 3q27(+) FL without t(14;18) translocation have peculiar clinico-pathologic features and may correspond to a rare and distinct subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> originating from the germinal center </plain></SENT>
