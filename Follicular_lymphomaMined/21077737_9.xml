<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the nuclear medicine session the advantages of the five-point scale Deauville criteria for interim PET reporting over the other sets of visual criteria were presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The specific problems of PET reporting in escalation/de-escalation trials in Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>) were addressed as well as the limitations of visual analysis for early PET evaluation in non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The applicability, efficacy, and reproducibility of quantitative criteria (Î”SUV(max) analysis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>/liver SUV ratio) for interim PET in NHL were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In retrospective and prospective series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some of the interim PET-based clinical trials ongoing worldwide in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> and NHL were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>, three trials aimed at determining the feasibility of omitting radiotherapy in interim PET negative patients, and in advanced-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> two PET-based ABVD escalation or BEACOPP de-escalation trials, in NHL two studies reported preliminary results of interim PET in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> a round-table discussion pointed out the lack of definite criteria for interim PET, and a few observational studies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> reported the comparison of the various techniques of interim PET reporting (visual versus quantitative) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The preliminary results of two international validation studies of the five-point scale criteria in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> and NHL launched in 2009 were reported </plain></SENT>
