<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case of prolonged severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0004313'>hypogammaglobulinemia</z:hpo> after rituximab combined chemotherapy for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the patient's globulin level was within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits before treatment, the level of IgG dropped below 100 mg/dL, and both IgA and IgM became undetectable after treatment, and the levels have shown no changes for 6 years despite recovery of peripheral B cell counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic analysis of B cells revealed a reduction of class-switched CD27+IgM-IgD- memory B cells below 0.5% and overexpression of CD95 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, we observed the predominance of memory T cell subsets in both of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as the result of reduction of na√Øve T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These increased memory T cells overexpressed activation markers such as CD69, CD95, and HLA-DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the patient's B cells failed to differentiate into memory B or plasma cells in the presence of IL-6, IL-10, IL-15, and BAFF in vitro in comparison with those from healthy controls and showed significant impairment of IgG production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that rituximab combined chemotherapy may induce persistent differentiation arrest and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of B cell lineage with alteration of T lymphocyte homeostasis resulting in pan-<z:hpo ids='HP_0004313'>hypogammaglobulinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
