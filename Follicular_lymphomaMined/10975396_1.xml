<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-specific DNA translocations may permit evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identify extracellular BCL2/IGH transgene DNA in the serum of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and evaluate its utility as a surrogate marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA was harvested from both the sera and bone marrow of 5 stage IV follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients prior to and after chemotherapy and following a novel vaccine-based regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serial PCR amplifications were performed using heminested BCL2-specific major breakpoint cluster region (MBR) primers and the immunoglobulin heavy chain consensus primer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Amplification products were detected by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis, and comparison was made to amplification products from the original <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results show that four of the five <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients carried extracellular BCL2/IGH transgene DNA in their serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining patient did not have an amplification product from either the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> or the serum, suggesting either the absence of a translocation or the presence of a variant translocation not detectable with this primer set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transgene DNA was detectable in serum even in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>, comparing favorably with bone marrow results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In at least one patient, the presence of the transgene in serum at the conclusion of therapy preceded relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it seems that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific, extracellular DNA is present in the serum of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, including those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because extracellular DNA may be released into the bloodstream by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> throughout the body it may be less subject to sampling error, and appears to be an ideal surrogate marker </plain></SENT>
