<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The risk of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) has been associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One possible mechanism may involve <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> as reactive oxygen species (ROS) can generate pro-inflammatory signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-oxidant enzymes including <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase and catalase protect against the harmful effects of ROS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetic variation in the genes coding for these enzymes (SOD2, GPX1, and CAT, respectively) alters ROS production and therefore may provide a mechanism for the relationship between <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from two population-based, case-control studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the UK (700 cases and 915 controls) and USA (1593 cases and 2517 controls) were pooled to analyze polymorphisms in genes involved in the <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> response (SOD2 Val16Ala, CAT C-262T and GPX1 Pro197Leu) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No associations were observed between SOD2 Val16Ala and CAT C-262T and total NHL, diffuse large-B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, when we looked at marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, a specific subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> characterised by <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, we found that homozygosity for the SOD2 16Ala allele was associated with a decreased risk among UK study participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The GPX1 197Leu allele was weakly associated with NHL and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: Analysis of genetic variation in <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> genes in two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> case-control studies suggests a possible role for <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in the risk of NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk modification is seen predominantly for marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> which frequently arise in the context of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in order to clarify the role of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in the etiology of NHL analyses of additional polymorphisms and haplotypes in these and other genes involved in the <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> response are needed </plain></SENT>
