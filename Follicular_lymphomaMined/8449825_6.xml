<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DNAs were extracted from unfixed fresh-frozen and/or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18) chromosomal translocation, resulting in bcl-2-JH (immunoglobulin heavy chain gene joining segment) fusion gene, was detected in 7 (36.8%) of 19 follicular small cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 6 (54.5%) of 11 follicular mixed, small cleaved cell and large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, 11 cases of follicular large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> revealed no bcl-2-JH fusion gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant difference in the frequency of bcl-2-JH rearrangement between follicular, small cleaved cell and large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (two-sided Fisher exact test, P = 0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The difference of bcl-2 rearrangement frequency between follicular, mixed and large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was also statistically significant (P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
