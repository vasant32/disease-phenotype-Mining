<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Non-Hodgkin's B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> account for approximately 70% of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While its incidence is dramatically increasing worldwide, the disease is still associated with high morbidity due to ineffectiveness of conventional therapies, creating an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unconventional compounds, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26195">polyphenols</z:chebi> and the cytokine TRAIL, are being extensively studied for their capacity to restore <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a large number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Molecular mechanisms of TRAIL-resistance and reactivation of the apoptotic machinery by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> in non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines were determined by Hoescht, flow cytometry, Western blot, qPCR, by use of siRNA or pharmacological inhibitors of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> pathway and by immunoprecipitation followed by post-translational modification analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi>, a natural <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi>, restores TRAIL-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in resistant transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B-cell lines, despite high Bcl-2 expression levels due to the chromosomal translocation t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">Quercetin</z:chebi> rescues <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> activation by inducing the proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1 and by inhibiting survivin expression at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level, irrespective of p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Restoration of the TRAIL pathway requires Bax and Bak but is independent of enhanced TRAIL DISC formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that inactivation of survivin and Mcl-1 expression by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> is sufficient to restore TRAIL sensitivity in resistant non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest, therefore, that combining <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> with TRAIL treatments may be useful in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
