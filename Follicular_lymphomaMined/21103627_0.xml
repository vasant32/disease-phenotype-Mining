<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The t(14;18) translocation, which leads to an overproduction of the bcl-2 protein, supposedly occurs in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) and can be detected by FISH methods or by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its detection is useful in monitoring the response to therapy and in assessing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently it was observed that the translocation could become negative after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prognostic and predictive significance of this fluctuation is not entirely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIM: We intended to find significant correlations among morphological features, histological grades, immunohistochemical findings, and cytogenetical aberrations in malignant follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, in order to identify the prognostic and predictive value of the bcl-2/IgH translocation in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a study on 79 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study was carried out on tissue samples selected from the "Victor Babes" National Institute of Pathology files </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These samples were tested by immunohistochemistry and FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results: Most of the cases (65.2%) were low-grade FL (grade 1-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Approximately 58.8% of cases in the FISH study group presented t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 66.6% of the cases with t(14;18), the immunohistochemical reaction for bcl-2 protein was positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A significant positive correlation was found between the IHC positivity for bcl-2 and t(14;18) detected by FISH (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bcl-2 t(14;18) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>FISH is an important tool in the diagnosis, treatment and follow up of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, since the immunohistochemical testing is negative in a significant proportion of cases </plain></SENT>
