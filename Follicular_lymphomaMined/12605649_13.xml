<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The pathogenesis and clinical significance of marginal zone differentiation in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> remains to be determined, although genetic alterations are likely to be important determinants of both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore report the cytogenetic findings in three cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with marginal zone differentiation studied by routine karyotyping and in-situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunophenotype of each case was typical of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> displaying marginal zone differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Karyotyping, performed on GTL-banded preparations of cell cultures derived from fresh lymph node tissue, revealed a complex karyotype in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases, including t(14;18)(q32;q21) and abnormalities associated with progression and/or transformation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 3 was found in one case and translocations between the q27-29 region of chromosome 3 and chromosome 2 in the other two cases; the latter was identified only in subclones derived from less complex stem lines possessing t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In-situ hybridization, performed on sections cut from routinely processed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks, localized cells possessing these abnormalities of chromosome 3 to both the follicular and marginal zone components of two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> studied in this way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 3 and alterations involving the q27-29 region of chromosome 3 are implicated in the pathogenesis of de novo marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their presence in the current cases indicates that they may also be responsible for marginal zone differentiation in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> when cells harbouring these genetic alterations are exposed to the appropriate microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings are consistent with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with marginal zone differentiation as a high-risk variant of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
