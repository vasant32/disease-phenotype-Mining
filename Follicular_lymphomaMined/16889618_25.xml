<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of ALC at diagnosis for follicular (grades 1 and 2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) on survival is not well described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary objective of this study was to assess the role of ALC on overall survival (OS) in FL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 1104 FL patients, 228 patients were originally diagnosed, followed, and had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment at the Mayo Clinic from 1984 and 1999, were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 89 months (range: 8.35-248) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ALC as a continuous variable was identified as a predictor for OS [Hazard ratio (HR) = 0.74, P &lt; 0.04] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ALC &gt;/= 1.0 x 10(9)/l (n = 164) predicted a longer OS versus ALC &lt; 1.0 x 10(9)/l (n = 64; 175 vs. 73 months respectively, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When compared with the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI), ALC was an independent prognostic factor for OS by multivariate analysis (HR = 0.677, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
