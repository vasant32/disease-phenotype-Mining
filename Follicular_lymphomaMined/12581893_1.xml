<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Successful karyotyping was possible in 97 patients (51.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> constituted 56% of the cases studied followed by diffuse type 20%, follicular 8.8%, lymphoblastic 6.6%, and unclassified 6.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Characteristic chromosomal translocations were t(8;14)(q24;q32) [32.2%], t(8;22)(q24;q11) [10%], t(2;8)(p12;q24) [2.2%], t(14;18)(q34;q21) [3.3%], and t(11;14)(q23;q32) [2.2%] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Notable geographical variation of some structural abnormalities was the finding in the present study such as, lower frequency of t(14;18) in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and higher frequency of t(8;14) in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> when compared with the Western studies </plain></SENT>
