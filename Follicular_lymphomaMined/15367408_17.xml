<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Different prognostic scores have been proposed to predict the outcome of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) patients at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A new prognostic index specifically addressing FL patients, the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI), has recently been developed, which might also be useful in patients with progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and three patients (55 male, 48 female; median age 59 years) with FL in first relapse/progression after an initial response to therapy (50 complete responders/ 53 partial responders) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five-year survival from progression (SFP) was 55% (95% confidence interval 44%-66%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The distribution according to the FLIPI at relapse was 39% good prognosis, 24% intermediate prognosis and 37% poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five-year SFP for these groups were 85%, 79% and 28%, respectively (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other variables at relapse with prognostic significance for SFP were age, presence of B symptoms, performance status, bulky disease, number of involved nodal sites, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase level, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level, histological transformation, the Italian <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Intergroup prognostic index for FL and the International Prognostic Index for aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis bulky disease (P=0.01), presence of B symptoms (P=0.03) and FLIPI at relapse (P=0.0003) were the most important variables for predicting SFP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with FL at first relapse/progression, the FLIPI, along with the presence of bulky disease and B symptoms, are features that predict SFP and thus could be useful to select candidates for experimental treatments </plain></SENT>
