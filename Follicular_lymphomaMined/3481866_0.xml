<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This case is comparable to the other associations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelocytic and lymphocytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood diseases</z:e> previously published </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They involve chemotherapy with alkylating drugs (but the diagnosis is sometimes simultaneous), cellular oncogens or, more probably, a clonal abnormality of the stem cell sequentially or concomitantly expressed in the cells of both lineages; unfortunately, in the absence of Philadelphia chromosome this theory has not yet been demonstrated on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
