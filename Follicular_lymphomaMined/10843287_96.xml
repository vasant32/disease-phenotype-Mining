<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cases studied comprised reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> (RLH; n = 19), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL; n = 50), low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 24), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 19), splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 13), diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>; n = 54), Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>; n = 20), nodular lymphocyte predominance <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (NLPHD; n = 16), and classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (CHD; n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In RLH, CD10 and BCL-6 were expressed almost exclusively by the follicular center cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast in FL, the expression of CD10 (39/50) and BCL-6 (34/36) was seen in both follicular and interfollicular neoplastic B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Marginal zone/MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were always negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> the expression was variable for both CD10 (21/54) and BCL-6 (39/47), with some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, including cases of transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (9/10), coexpressing CD10 and BCL-6, and others expressing only BCL-6, and a small group expressing neither marker, possibly reflecting the underlying primary pathogenetic events such as the rearrangement of BCL-2 or BCL-6 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> was always both CD10 and BCL-6 positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In NLPHD the L&amp;H cells expressed BCL-6 (11/13) but not CD10, whereas in CHD BCL-6 expression was seen in half of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that both CD10 and BCL-6 are reliable markers of follicular center B-cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD10 and BCL-6 immunostaining have an important role in differential diagnosis of FL from RLH and other low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results also suggest that a CD10/BCL-6 expression pattern may be helpful in identifying main subsets of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, additional studies comparing genotype with immunophenotype are required </plain></SENT>
