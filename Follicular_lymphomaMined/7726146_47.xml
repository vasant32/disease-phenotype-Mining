<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to compare the ability of cytogenetic analysis (CG), Southern analysis (SA) and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the t(14; 18) in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> methodologies were performed by standard techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The probes used for SA included major breakpoint region (mbr) and minor cluster region (mcr) probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primers for PCR were identical or similar to those used by other investigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred fifteen cases of FL were ascertained by morphologic criteria, from which sufficient fresh tissue was available for both CG and molecular analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven cases failed by both methods (nonrepresentative sampling) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred four cases showed evidence of an abnormal clone by CG and/or immunoglobulin gene rearrangement (IgH) studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis failed in 2 cases, was positive for t(14; 18) in 91 of the remaining 102 cases (89%) and detected a non-t(14; 18) close in 11 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An IgH clonal rearrangement was confirmed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 104 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Southern analysis detected a mbr or mcr rearrangement in 78 of 104 cases (75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction detected an mbr or mcr rearrangement in 68 of 104 cases (65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of PCR as a clinical test to detect t(14; 18)-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, with single primer sets for the mbr and mcr, will result in a high false-negative rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The use of additional primers to detect uncommon breakpoints sites will be required to enhance the sensitivity of PCR for detection of t(14; 18) in malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
