<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reported experience with transplantation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) is, so far, limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The feasibility and the therapeutic efficacy of intensive therapy followed by unpurged autologous PBPC reinfusion were evaluated in 60 patients with poor-prognosis follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients were in first partial remission (PR), 34 were in second partial or complete remission (CR), and 14 were in subsequent progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the time of the procedure, 39 patients (65%) had persistent bone marrow involvement, 49 patients (82%) were in PR, and 16 patients had presented with a histologic transformation (HT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PBPC were collected after chemotherapy followed by granulocyte (G) colony-stimulating factor (CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF in 50 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conditioning regimens included high-dose chemotherapy alone (14 patients); mainly the BCNU, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, aracytine, melphalan [BEAM] regimen), or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> plus total body irradiation (46 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median time to reach a neutrophil count greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/L was 13 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were five treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, with four being associated with a delayed engraftment and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> occurring in patients in third or subsequent progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 21 months, 48 patients were still alive, 18 relapsed, and seven died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Estimated 2-year overall survival (OS) and failure-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e>) rates were 86% and 53%, respectively, without or plateau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients treated in PR1 or PR2/CR2 had a significantly longer rate of OS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> than those treated in subsequent progression (P = .002 and P = .001, respectively), whereas age, response to salvage treatment, presence or absence of residual bone marrow involvement, or conditioning regimen had no influence on outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with HT tended to have a worse <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> rate (P = .04) without an OS difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Along with an unusual rate of engraftment failure, the poor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> observed in heavily pretreated patients suggests that intensive therapy should be performed early in the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Given the high percentage of patients intensified in PR with residual bone marrow involvement, our results are comparable with those achieved with ABMT published to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Prospective trials are warranted to compare this strategy with standard therapy in patients with relapsing or PR follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
