<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs are naturally occurring small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> species that regulate gene expression and are frequently abnormally expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of microRNAs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we undertook a comprehensive study of microRNA expression in two of the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>: diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) (n = 80) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FCL) (n = 18) using microarrays containing probes for 464 human microRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unsupervised cluster analysis revealed distinct expression patterns between these two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and specific microRNA signatures (including members of the miR-17-92 cluster) were derived that correctly predicted <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> type in &gt;95% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we identified microRNAs in de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (n = 64) associated with germinal centre-like and non-germinal centre-like immunophenotypes, international prognostic index status and event-free survival in CHOP and rituximab (R)-CHOP treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite the indolent nature of FCL a significant proportion of cases undergo high-grade transformation to more aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In order to see if transformation is associated with changes in microRNA expression we compared transformed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> cases (n = 16) with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, as well as FCL cases that underwent subsequent transformation (n = 7) with FCL cases that had not transformed at a median follow-up of 60 months (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differential expression of 12 microRNAs correctly predicted &gt;85% of transformed versus de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> cases; six microRNAs (miR-223, 217, 222, 221 and let-7i and 7b) were found which could similarly predict or transformation in FCL (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that microRNAs have potential as diagnostic and prognostic markers in these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and may be used to identify FCL patients at risk of high-grade transformation </plain></SENT>
