<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only resection materials in state IE and IIE-1 were included in this study because of the certainty that the intestine was the primary site of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The updated Kiel classification was used to classify NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histologically, only two cases (5.1%) were follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and the others were diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients (71.8%) had high-grade NHL and 11 (28.2%) had low-grade NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty (71.4%) of the 28 high-grade NHL were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and 14 (70.0%) of these 20 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were the polymorphic variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten (90.9%) of the 11 low-grade NHL were low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Macroscopically, 18 patients had polypoid masses, 17 ulcerative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and four had diffusely infiltrating NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven of the 10 low-grade MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were polypoid masses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, 35 lesions (89.7%) were of the B <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> and three (7.7%) were of the T <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the remaining case, the cell lineage could not be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No lesions were considered to be of histiocytic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 5 year survival rate for high-grade B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was poorer than for low-grade B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and the present study indicated that the histological grade of the intestinal B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was a prognostically significant factor </plain></SENT>
