<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gene expression profiling was performed using DNA-microarrays on 52 tumour biopsy samples [31 DLCL and 21 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL)] from 48 patients (28 DLCL and 20 FL) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> analysis was applied on a distinct series of 36 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded DLCL samples and showed that TCL1A immunoexpression was correlated with either higher relapse (p=0.02) or lower 5-year overall survival (p=0.009) rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the prognostic value of TCL1A was independent from IPI in our series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that TCL1A immunodetection is an independent marker of adverse outcome that could be used in routine settings for the management of DLCL patients </plain></SENT>
