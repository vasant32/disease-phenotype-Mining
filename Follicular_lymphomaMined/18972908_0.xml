<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High-dose therapy (HDT) followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) can unequivocally prolong the disease-free survival (DFS) but not overall survival (OS) in the first complete remission and in a salvage setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, the incorporation of rituximab and radioimmunoconjugates in HDT with AHSCT seems to be promising and widely accepted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) consistently demonstrates longer DFS compared with historical controls of HDT followed by AHSCT, this approach cannot be considered as a standard of care due to its unacceptably high treatment-related mortality (TRM) and the lack of improving OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With highly encouraging results and less TRM, the role of nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (NMHSCT), especially after AHSCT needs to be validated in randomized controlled trials with a long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
