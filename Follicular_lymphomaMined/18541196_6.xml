<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective analysis to examine long-term disease control and treatment-related mortality (TRM) in a group of patients that underwent transplant for clinically high-risk disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients with indolent FL (follicular small cleaved [FSC], follicular mixed [FM] or FL grades 1 or 2 by WHO criteria) underwent allo-SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were in a chemosensitive remission at the time of SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen was typically <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (BuCy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">Cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>-total body irradiation (TBI) was used for unrelated donor SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age at the time of transplant was 45 years (range: 24-58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 3 (range: 1-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients received BuCy conditioning and 2 patients underwent reduced intensity conditioning SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two percent of patients had a matched sibling donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 63.5 months in survivors, the 5-year overall survival is 79.1% (95% confidence interval 66.3%-94.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TRM was 15.4%, with an additional case of mortality from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that in selected younger patients, a fully myeloablative allo-SCT utilizing BuCy conditioning provides excellent OS and disease control with low TRM </plain></SENT>
