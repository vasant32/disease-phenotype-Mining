<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The results of a chemotherapy regimen utilizing adriamycin in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> plus or minus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CHOP-HOP) for the treatment of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are compared to those of a non-adriamycin containing combination (COP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The complete remission (CR) rate of 67% for CHOP-HOP in malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, diffuse histiocytic type (MLDH) is superior to 33% obtained with COP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, nodular poorly differentiated lymphocytic (MLNPD), the CR rate was: CHOP-HOP 83%, COP 44% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prognostic factors for both treatment groups were compared and found to be similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, adriamycin appears to be responsible for this improvement in CR rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When analyzed as a group, the patients treated with CHOP-HOP had a longer survival than those treated with COP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This difference was also evident in the subgroup of patients with MLDH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The smaller subgroup of patients with MLNPD treated with CHOP-HOP did not show a significant improvement in survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A trend for longer duration of CR in both diffuse and nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was also observed, but this difference did not reach statistical significance possibly due to the smaller numbers of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combination chemotherapy with adriamycin has resulted in a higher CR rate and survival for patients with non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> particularly for the subgroup of patients with MLDH </plain></SENT>
