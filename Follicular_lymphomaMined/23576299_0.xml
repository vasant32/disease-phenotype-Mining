<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program database between the years of 1973 and 2008, and individual characteristics were compared using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed and log-rank tests were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 2,140 patients with primary parotid gland <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was found in 3.5% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More common were non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes: marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> accounted for 27.9%, 25.8%, and 23.7% of cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival was decreased with patient age over 50 years, increasing stage, male gender, non-Hodgkin histology, and status other than married </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the patients, 72.0% received some form of surgery, and 136 patients had facial nerve sacrifice during parotidectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is the predominant type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> seen in the parotid gland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patient and histologic features determine survival, and surgery is often performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Facial nerve sacrifice, which is contraindicated given the systemic nature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the role of chemotherapy and radiation in its treatment, is reported in 6.4% of patients with parotid gland <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2b </plain></SENT>
