<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Kiel classification for the histology of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> distinguishes the group of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> as low-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinically, this proves to be a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the aim of establishing parameters giving indications for the prognosis of the patient, a retrospective analysis was made of 30 patients with a histologic diagnosis of follicular follicle center cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (FCC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neither the immunologic markers of the cells nor the stage of dissemination have prognostic significance for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the predominating neoplastic cell type, a cytologic subdivision of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was made, characterizing the following subgroups: <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> (small centrocytes with occasional centroblasts), CBCC/A (centrocytes with several centroblasts), and CBCC/B (centrocytes with many centroblasts), SLCC (small and large centrocytes), SLCB (small and large centroblasts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival of the total group of 30 patients was 66% after 5 years, but the survival in the cytologic subgroups ranged from 100% in group <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> to 0% in group SLCB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparing the groups <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> and CBCC/A with CBCC/B and SLCB gave a significantly worse prognosis for the groups with an increased number of centroblasts (i.e., CBCC/B and SLCB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore it seems justified to treat patients with a predominance of centroblasts aggressively with the aim of reaching a complete remission </plain></SENT>
