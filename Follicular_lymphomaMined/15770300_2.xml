<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), a common subtype of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) in the West, represents a rare subtype in Jordan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 gene rearrangement plays a crucial role in the biology of the vast majority of FL and a substantial number of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) in the West; but its presence has not been studied in Jordan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aims are to document if bcl-2 gene rearrangement exists in Jordanian FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, and if present to determine whether its frequency among these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is different from the West and therefore may be responsible for some of the epidemiological differences seen between Jordan and the West </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was conducted in the year 2001 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to detect bcl-2 gene rearrangement in paraffin sections in 5 FL and 23 DLBCL cases diagnosed at the Department of Pathology at Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two sets of primers including the major breakpoint region (MBR) and the minor cluster region (MCR) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Amplifiable DNA was extracted from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 gene rearrangement was seen among 4 (80%) of 5 FL cases, and 8 (35%) of 23 DLBCL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of the rearrangements involved the MBR; however, one fourth of cases (one of 4 FL; 2 of 8 DLBCL) with bcl-2 rearrangement involved the MCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bcl-2 gene rearrangement was seen in the vast majority of Jordanian FL cases and approximately one third of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These figures are similar to those reported in the West, and therefore bcl-2 gene rearrangement does not help in explaining the epidemiological differences of NHL between Jordan and the West </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of bcl-2 gene rearrangement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> may define a subset of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that may be biologically and clinically unique and different from the rest of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
