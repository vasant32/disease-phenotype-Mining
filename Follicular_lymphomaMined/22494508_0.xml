<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purposes of this study are to evaluate the clinical outcome of NHLs of the oral cavity and maxillofacial region in a group of 58 patients who were diagnosed in our clinic and to discuss the clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical features of these malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, as well as the prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 58 patients with extranodal NHLs of the oral cavity and maxillofacial region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 32 male and 26 female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients' ages ranged from 7 to 81 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most frequent sites of occurrence were the salivary glands (24 patients) and intraoral mucosa (21 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other sites were the paranasal sinus (3 patients), Waldeyer ring (4 patients), bone of the jaws (3 patients), and orbit (3 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The histologic subtype was extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) in 21 patients, diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) in 19, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> in 10, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 4, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 2, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in 1, and B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> cases, 13 were stage IIE and 6 were stage IE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were stage IE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 5 years after the initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A better prognosis was found in patients with MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (19 of 21 patients are alive) compared with those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> (10 of 19 patients are alive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> have a more favorable outcome (about 90%) in comparison with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Careful examination of the oral cavity and neck by the maxillofacial surgeon is essential for the diagnosis and staging of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
