<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that these vaccinated patients could generate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific immune responses, not only against idiotype, but also against other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated antigens (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi>) by a mechanism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> spreading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify potential antigens, a phage surface expressed cDNA library derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> cells was screened with sera from idiotype-vaccinated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consistent with our hypothesis, we identified two immunogenic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (FL-aa-7 and 18), unrelated to idiotype, which were recognized by postvaccine sera but not by prevaccine or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> sequences derived from the 5'-untranslated regions of the human GTPase, IMAP family member 7 gene (FL-aa-7) and an alternative reading frame of U1-snRNP 70 (FL-aa-18), respectively, suggesting that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> spreading had occurred </plain></SENT>
