<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of both proliferating-cell nuclear antigen and the cell-proliferation-associated antigen Ki-67 have also been reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>P34cdc2 is the protein product of the cell-cycle-control cdc-2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a monoclonal antibody against the protein p34, cases of three different histological subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> have been studied along with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tonsil and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, positive p34 staining was seen in the majority of Reed-Sternberg cells and mononuclear variants (&gt; 80%), along with a proportion of small lymphocytes, mainly T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Staining was predominantly cytoplasmic and occasionally additional nuclear signals were apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two cases, double immunostaining with the anti-p34 antibody and CM-1 for p53 demonstrated positive signals for both proteins within the same neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the presence of p34 in Reed-Sternberg or variant cells reflects mitosis and hence suggests proliferation, the possibility of endomitosis remains and may explain the multinucleated appearance of Reed-Sternberg cells </plain></SENT>
