<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Responding patients have subsequently been randomised to receive maintenance interferon-alpha 2b or no further treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 124 treated patients, 108 are evaluable for response with a median follow-up of 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The major toxicity was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> which was more frequent with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> and IFN alpha 2b in combination than with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> alone (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no treatment-related mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival at three years is 75% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, regardless of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in response rate according to initial therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the 60 patients achieving a good response to initial therapy who have entered the second part of the trial, there has been a significant prolongation of remission duration in favour of maintenance IFN-alpha 2b (median not yet reached versus two years for the 'no treatment' arm, P less than 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fewest relapses have been seen in patients who received IFN-alpha 2b throughout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Accrual to this trial continues; this preliminary analysis indicates that maintenance IFN-alpha 2b may extend remission duration in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
