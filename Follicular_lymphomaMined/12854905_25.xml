<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In prior studies, PDX exhibited enhanced efficacy over <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) in lung and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> xenografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because MTX is active in the treatment of aggressive non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), we compared the efficacy of PDX and MTX against five <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines: RL (transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), HT, SKI-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>-1 (diffuse large B cell), Raji (Burkitt's), and Hs445 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 5-day continuous in vitro exposure, PDX demonstrated &gt; 10-fold greater cytotoxicity than MTX in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines (IC50PDX = 3-5 nM, IC50MTX = 30-50 nM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then compared the in vivo effects of anti-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folates</z:chebi> against three established human NHL xenografts in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> bearing animals were treated with saline (control) or the maximum tolerated doses of MTX (40 mg/kg) or PDX (60 mg/kg) via an intraperitoneal route twice weekly for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Almost 90% of HT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> treated with PDX completely regressed, whereas, those treated with MTX treatment had only modest growth delays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two other xenografts, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> bearing mice had complete regression rates of 56% (RL) and 30% (SKI-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>-1) after PDX therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No regressions and only minor growth inhibition was noted after MTX therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR analysis for the expression of genes involved in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> metabolism demonstrated that increased sensitivity to PDX correlated with higher RFC-1 gene expression with no difference in FPGS or FPGH levels, suggesting that measurement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> RFC-1 gene expression level may be a predictor of response to PDX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that the PDX has markedly greater potential activity against human NHL than MTX and warrants further preclinical and clinical evaluation </plain></SENT>
