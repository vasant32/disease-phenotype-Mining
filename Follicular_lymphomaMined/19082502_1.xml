<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our retrospective study was to evaluate the sensitivity and the reproducibility of both conventional qualitative and quantitative PCR assays for detection of the t(14;18)(q32;q21) chromosomal translocation in biopsy material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> lymph node (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>) specimens from 50 patients with FL were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Qualitative PCR was performed with primer sets specific for the MBR, far3'-MBR and the mcr regions, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative PCR was performed using the LightCycler instrument and the LightCycler - t(14;18) Quantification Kit (MBR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall detection rate of the t(14;18) in our study (52.6%) was in accordance with the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the t(14;18)-positive cases, 49.1% had breakpoints within the MBR and only 3.5% had breakpoints within the mcr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most sensitive method was LightCycler-based PCR with a detection rate of 47.4%, followed by MBR1,2 assay (43.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We observed good agreement between qualitative MBR1,2 and quantitative LightCycler-based assay with a slightly higher detection rate of the quantitative method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivities of both methods were in accordance with results from other studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since LightCycler-based assay detects only breakpoints within the MBR, qualitative PCR should be employed in routine diagnostic settings for detection of breakpoints within the mcr and far3'-MBR regions </plain></SENT>
