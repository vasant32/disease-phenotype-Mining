<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although plasma cell differentiation is common in these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, an overt plasmablastic transformation (PBL-T) has been only rarely reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report 6 cases of PBL-T occurring in 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo> (CLL) and 3 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five patients were men, and the mean age was 65 years (range, 52 to 72 y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of them had history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 3 cases the PBL-T occurred 34 to 85 months after the initial diagnosis, and in 3 it was detected simultaneously with the small cell component at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received chemotherapy after transformation, and 4 died 4 to 24 months after this diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 3 cases, PBL-T occurred in an extranodal site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> PBL-Ts had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> with admixed plasma cells, were CD20 and PAX5 negative, expressed Î» light chain, and 5 were CD138 positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were negative for HHV8, and only 1 PBL-T was Epstein-Barr virus positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Evidence of a clonal relationship between the small cell and PBL-T components was found in 5 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 2 CLL cases, both components had 13q deletions, and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases both components harbored the t(14;18) translocation </plain></SENT>
