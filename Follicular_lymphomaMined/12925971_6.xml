<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Adequate intracellular concentrations of ara-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi>, the monophosphorylated derivative of ara-C, are essential for its cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The critical step for ara-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> formation is intracellular phosphorylation of ara-C by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A common <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> resistance mechanism is mutation affecting the expression or the specificity of dCK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe the ability of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30355">tert-butyl</z:chebi> S-acyl-thioethyl (SATE) derivative of ara-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> (UA911) to circumvent ara-C resistance in a dCK-deficient human follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (RL-G) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The RL-G cell line was produced by continuous exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi> and displayed low dCK <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression that conferred resistance both to ara-C (2,250-fold) and to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi> (2,092-fold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RL-G cells were able to take up the UA911 pronucleotide by diffusion and metabolize it to the corresponding ara-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> and ara-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi>, exhibiting a 199-fold reduction in resistance ratios, and a similar cell cycle arrest to the parental RL-7 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exposures to 10, 50 or 100 microM concentrations of UA911 produced 160 +/- 7, 269 +/- 8 and 318 +/- 62 pmol ara-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>/mg protein in RL-7 cells, and 100 +/- 12, 168 +/- 10 and 217 +/- 39 pmol ara-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>/mg protein in RL-G cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exposure of RL-G cells to underivatized, radiolabeled ara-C produced no detectable amounts of the active <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the UA911 pronucleotide is capable of overcoming dCK-mediated resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This result can be attributed to the unique cellular metabolism of the SATE pronucleotides giving rise to the intracellular delivery of ara-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> to dCK-deficient cells </plain></SENT>
