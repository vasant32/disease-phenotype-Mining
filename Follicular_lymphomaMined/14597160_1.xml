<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied cell lines with different translocations into the IgH locus to gauge any common features associated with downstream CSR events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CSR associated with chromosomal rearrangements was observed in cells (RL) with translocations similar to those frequently observed in FL (bcl-2-JH), and such CSR was also seen with a myc (near exon 1)-JH5 intron translocation (MC116), but not for far 5'-myc-JH5 intron (P3HR-1) or myc-Smu translocations (Ramos) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both MC116 and P3HR-1 myc translocations showed evidence for an origin from somatic hypermutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the association of JH translocations with CSR on the translocated allele is unlikely to be linked with specific translocation mechanisms, and the P3HR-1 configuration indicated that the downstream class switching is not a necessary consequence of (or precondition for) such a translocation event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MC116 and RL, but not P3HR-1 cells, showed constitutive transcription through the translocated IgH alleles, suggesting that transcription through this region or the processing of such transcripts may promote CSR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, while CSR events clearly occurred in the precursors of MC116 and RL, neither cell line could undergo complete class switching </plain></SENT>
