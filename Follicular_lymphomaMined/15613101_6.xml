<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) with L2 (FAB) <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> has rarely been reported to show t(14;18)(q32;q21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to delineate the stage at which this type of ALL is derived in B-lineage differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The somatic hypermutation (SHM) of the variable region of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgV(H)) gene and the expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), recombination-activating gene 1 and 2 (RAG-1 and -2), and activation-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminase (AID) were investigated in three cell lines and two fresh samples, including a pair of matched fresh and cell line cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TdT, RAG-1, and RAG-2 were variably expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AID was expressed in four of five samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SHM of the IgV(H) gene was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples with high average frequency (11.84%) comparable with that in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ongoing mutation was seen in two fresh samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: As AID and SHM are generally regarded as properties exhibited by mature B cells, the presence of AID and SHM in this study seems to be incompatible with the general understanding of the early stage derivation of ALL in B-lineage differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results here give some insight into the relationship between disease type (ALL or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) and derivation stage, the overlapping of the early stage phenotype and the mature genomic characteristics, and the probable relationship between the mechanism of the occurrence of t(14;18)(q32;q21) and the machinery causing SHM </plain></SENT>
