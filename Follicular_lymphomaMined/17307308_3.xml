<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deposition of C4d was detected in 118 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissues from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in 20 reactive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> lymphadens (RHL) using immunohistochemistical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FL, MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and RHL were studied using double staining for CD35/C4d and Bcl-2/C4d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 26 FL tissues, 19 of which showed C4d deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>C4d deposition was detected around the follicular dendritic cells (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi>) in the neoplastic follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the positive ratio of C4d and the grades of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We studied 12 MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissues, six of which displayed C4d deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these tissues, C4d deposition was detected in the peripheral region of partially colonized follicles in the form of an irregular ring, but was not found in the central region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>C4d deposition was negative in completely colonized follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no C4d deposition in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, B-small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, T-lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>C4d around the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> in the neoplastic follicles was a specific indicator for FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>C4d deposition in partially colonized follicles of MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was completely different from that in neoplastic follicles of FL, forming a key point for differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
