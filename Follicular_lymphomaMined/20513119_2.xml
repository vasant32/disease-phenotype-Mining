<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Still, this information is not used for classification of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (BCLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Traditionally, BCLs are diagnosed based on a phenotypic resemblance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cells; assessed by immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry, by using a handful of phenotypic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the last decade, diagnostic and prognostic evaluation has been facilitated by global gene expression profiling (GEP), providing a new powerful means for the classification, prediction of survival, and response to treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, most GEP studies have typically been performed on whole tissue samples, containing varying degrees of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell content, which results in uncertainties in data analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, global GEP analyses were performed on highly purified, flow-cytometry sorted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-cells from eight subgroups of BCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This enabled identification of TFs that can be uniquely associated to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (HCL), and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The identified transcription factors influence both the global and specific gene expression of the BCLs and have possible implications for diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
