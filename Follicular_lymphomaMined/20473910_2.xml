<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data from earlier studies that are part of this pooling study implicate a functional polymorphism (-1C&gt;T, rs1883832) in the TNFRSF5 gene encoding CD40 in the etiology of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, the association of this variant with non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) risk was replicated in a European multicenter study of 855 NHL cases and 1,206 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the combined analysis of 2,617 cases and 3,605 controls, carrying the TT genotype was associated with an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL (OR = 1.4; p for linear trend = 0.00009), diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR = 1.6; p for linear trend = 0.002) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR = 1.6; p for linear trend = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
