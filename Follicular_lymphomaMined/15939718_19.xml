<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two new prognostic indexes have recently been proposed for FL [the Italian <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Intergroup (ILI) Index and the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three indexes, IPI [age &gt;60 years, extranodal involvement two or more sites, elevated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH), Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group performance status &gt; or =2, stage &gt; or =3], ILI (age &gt;60 years, extranodal involvement two or more sites, elevated LDH, male sex, B symptoms, erythrocyte sedimentation rate &gt; or =30 mm first hour) and FLIPI (age &gt;60 years, stage &gt; or =3, elevated LDH, nodal involvement five or more, <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> level &lt; or =12 g/dl) were calculated in 411 patients with FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall concordance between the three indexes was 54% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 126 (31%) patients were included in the high-risk group according to IPI, 131 (32%) according to ILI and 157 (38%) after FLIPI application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten-year overall survival rates after applying the prognostic indexes (IPI, ILI and FLIPI) were, respectively: 72%, 71% and 72%, in the low-risk group; 51%, 60% and 49% in the intermediate-risk group; and 24%, 16% and 31% in the high-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this series, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three indexes, IPI, ILI and FLIPI, were useful to classify FL patients into differentiated risk groups, although the FLIPI identified a larger proportion of high-risk patients than the IPI and ILI </plain></SENT>
