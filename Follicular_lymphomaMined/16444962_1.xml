<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On examination, abdominal lymph node swelling and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CA125 level decreased during treatment and was normalized at complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An immunohistochemical assay of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, however, failed to demonstrate any CA125 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several reports have described that CA125 might be produced by mesothelial cells in response to cytokines released by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, and increased levels of CA125 have been significantly associated with abdominal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is possible that CA125 will become a useful marker in the observation of the progression of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the abdomen </plain></SENT>
