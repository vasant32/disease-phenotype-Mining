<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Presentation at this young age is usually indicative of underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo>/immunodysregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A group of such infants suffer intractable ulcerating <z:hpo ids='HP_0004387'>enterocolitis</z:hpo> of infancy (IE) in which there is a pan-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014335" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enteritis</z:e> with marked <z:chebi fb="39" ids="29287">oro</z:chebi>-anal involvement and deep flask like mucosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> throughout the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective review of presenting features, treatment and long-term outcome in a series of 8 children with typical IE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 8 children were aged between 1 and 4 weeks at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (median 2 weeks, mean 2.3 weeks), of which 7 were followed up for 2-22 years (median 7.5 years, mean 11 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 8 children had an intractable disease course requiring a colectomy for control of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age at colectomy was 1.7 years (range 4 months-4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three children developed a generalised <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> due to uncontrolled EBV-related lymphoid proliferations (ages 4, 12, 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These comprised a monomorphous B-lymphoycte lympho-proliferative disorder, a large pleomorphic follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and a high grade pleomorphic B cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Infants with IE have a high risk of developing lymphomatous proliferations that appears to be related to the underlying immunodysregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Use of aggressive immunosuppression and acquisition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> appears to accelerate this process; hence we advocate early colectomy in confirmed cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In children with IE screening for EBV and vigilance for abnormal lymphoid proliferations is paramount </plain></SENT>
