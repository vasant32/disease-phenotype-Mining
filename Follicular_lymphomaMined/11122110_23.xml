<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), aberrations in DNA copy number were studied before and after transformation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in six patients (15 lymph node biopsies in total) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most common and also the most discrete and intense amplification occurring in four out of 15 biopsies from three different patients was of 2p13-16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR), REL amplification was found to be implicated at this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This technique also identified amplified REL in a further two biopsies, presumably below the detection level of CGH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>REL amplification was quantified by comparing it, in most cases, with three endogenous reference genes, albumin, beta2-microglobulin and CD8alpha, that lie close to REL on 2p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation apparent between 2p13-16 amplification or REL amplification and transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study shows the usefulness of coupling CGH, for detecting recurring abnormalities, with the real-time PCR technique for rapid gene dosage quantification and confirms that the REL gene is a potential candidate in the pathogenesis of a particular subset of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
