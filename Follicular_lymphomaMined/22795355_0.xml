<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two hundred sixty-four diagnostic tissue specimens from patients suffering from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who received therapy within prospective randomized trials of the German Low Grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Study Group were analyzed immunohistochemically for FoxP3 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-1 expression to detect regulatory and follicular helper T-cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We did not find any correlation between the content of regulatory and follicular helper T-cells and the time to treatment failure or overall survival in patients with advanced stages of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in need of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, a perifollicular pattern of regulatory T-cells was associated with a poorer prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The content of regulatory T-cells was positively and the content of follicular helper T-cells inversely correlated with a higher stage of the disease at diagnosis, implying that the microenvironment changes during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> dissemination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This finding is independent of any therapy administered and needs to be considered when possible biomarkers related to the microenvironment of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are studied </plain></SENT>
