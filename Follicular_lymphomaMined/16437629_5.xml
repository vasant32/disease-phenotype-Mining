<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To demonstrate the (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) findings in patients with non-Hodgkinos <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) involving the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the clinical utility of modality despite of the known <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> uptake of FDG in the GI tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-three patients with biopsy-proven gastrointestinal NHL who had undergone FDG-PET scan were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were injected with 10-15 mCi FDG and scanned approximately 60 min later with a CTI/Siemens HR (+) PET scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PET scans were reviewed and the maximum standard uptake value (SUV(max)) of the lesions was measured before and after the treatment, if data were available and compared with histologic diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five patients had a high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and eight had a low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The stomach was the most common site of the involvement (20 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, PET showed focal nodular or diffuse hypermetabolic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average SUV(max)+/-SD was 11.58+/-5.83 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After the therapy, the patients whose biopsies showed no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had a lower uptake without focal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The SUV(max)+/-SD decreased from 11.58+/-5.83 to 2.21+/-0.78 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients whose post-treatment biopsies showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the SUV(max)+/-SD was 9.42+/-6.27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the colon and stomach showed diffuse hypermetabolic activity in the bowel wall (SUV(max) 8.2 and 10.3, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The SUV(max) was 2.02-3.8 (mean 3.02) in the stomach lesions of patients with MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ONCLUSION: (18)F-FDG PET contributes to the diagnosis of high-grade gastrointestinal non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, even when there is the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> background FDG activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the SUV plays a role in evaluating treatment response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Low-grade NHL demonstrates FDG uptake but at a lesser intensity than seen in high-grade NHL </plain></SENT>
