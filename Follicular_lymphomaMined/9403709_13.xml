<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new monoclonal antibody (MAb), CNA.42, was generated using the CEM T-cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It recognizes a 120-kd formalin-resistant glycosylated antigen that is mainly expressed by follicular dendritic reticulum cells (FDRCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This antigen is also expressed by a few mononuclear cells in the paracortical area of reactive lymph nodes and by some cortical thymocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and eighty-nine cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic tumors</z:e> of various types were tested with this antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They showed either intact FDRC networks or FDRC networks dispersed among malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the follicular pattern was highlighted by CNA.42 MAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expanded FDRC networks were found in angioimmunoblastic T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neoplastic cells were positive in 43.6% (24/55) of T-cell and 4.6% (6/129) of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The highest percentage of cases with positive neoplastic cells was found in anaplastic large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (62.5%; 15/24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, FDRC networks, sometimes encasing Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells, were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HRS cells were also stained by this antibody in 23 (21.9%) of the 105 cases examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A variety of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> nonlymphoid tissues and nonhematopoietic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, such as some neurogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and occasional <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo>, were found to be positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the reactivity of CNA.42 antibody with FDRCs of lymphoid tissue from different animal species showed similar reactivity to that observed in humans, suggesting widespread evolutionary conservation of the antigen recognized by this antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In daily diagnostic practice, CNA.42 MAb seems to be a suitable FDRC marker and possibly has an auxiliary role in recognizing T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
