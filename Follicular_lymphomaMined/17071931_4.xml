<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current trial explored prospectively the rate of successful stem cell mobilization in patients with advanced stage FL after initial therapy with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">Mitoxantrone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">Chlorambucil</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">Prednisone</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">Cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">Doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">Vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">Prednisone</z:chebi> (CHOP) as part of a prospective randomized comparison of both regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ASCT patients received Dexa-BEAM (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">Dexamethasone</z:chebi>, BCNU, Melphalan, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">Etoposide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">Cytarabine</z:chebi>) for mobilization of stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stem cells were collected and a minimum of 2x2.0x106/kg bw CD34+ was required for ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 79 evaluable patients, 58 (73%) had follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 13 (16%) mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 8 (10%) lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 45 patients assigned to CHOP, stem cell collection was successful in 42 cases (93%, 95% CI 82% to 99%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This high mobilization rate after CHOP could be confirmed in 61 subsequent patients (87%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, after <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> therapy stem cell collection was successful in only 15 of 34 patients (44%, 95% CI 27% to 62%; P=0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, initial therapy with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> significantly impairs the ability to collect stem cells and should be avoided for first line therapy of younger patients potentially qualifying for high dose consolidation and ASCT in first remission </plain></SENT>
