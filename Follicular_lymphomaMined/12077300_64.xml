<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the gene-expression profiles between transformed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and their antecedent FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No genes were observed to increase or decrease their expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the cases of histological transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, two different gene-expression profiles associated with the transformation process were defined, one in which c-myc and genes regulated by c-myc showed increased expression and one in which these same genes showed decreased expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, there was a striking difference in gene-expression profiles between transformed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, because the gene-expression profile of transformed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> was more similar to their antecedent FL than to de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that transformation from FL to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> can occur by alternative pathways and that transformed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> have very different gene-expression profiles that may underlie the different clinical behaviors of these two types of morphologically similar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
