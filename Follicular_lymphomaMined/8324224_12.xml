<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody has been raised that recognizes Igs with heavy chains encoded by a member of the VH4 family, the VH4-21 gene segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The idiotope (Id) is detectable on a high percentage of early B cells in fetal spleen, and is expressed by certain autoantibodies, particularly cold-reactive anti-red blood cell antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it was of interest to investigate usage of this VH gene by neoplastic B cells; 81 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo> (CLLs) involving CD5+ B cells and 62 B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of varying histologic type have been analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Id was expressed by only 3 of 81 (3.7%) of the CLLs, indicating a relatively low usage by these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the Id was expressed by 9 of 62 (14.5%) of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> across a range of histologic types, indicating a differential use of the VH4-21 gene among B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For three of the Id-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, each of a different histologic class, the nucleotide sequence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-derived VH gene was determined; the VH4-21 gene was identified, as expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sequence from the CLL was identical to the germline sequence, and the marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed only 3 nucleotide changes, 2 of which gave rise to amino acid substitutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the sequence from the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed 29 nucleotide changes giving rise to 14 amino acid substitutions, which were scattered among the CDR and FW regions </plain></SENT>
