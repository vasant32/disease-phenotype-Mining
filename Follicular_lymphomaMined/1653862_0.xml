<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For detecting EBV DNA, Southern blot analysis with Bam HIW probe (Internal Repeat) and non-repeat (least often deleted) probe are used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Probes close to (ex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LMP) or within terminal repeat can indicate clonality in terms of junctional structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several such examples were shown, in which benign polyclonal EBV (+) CD3 + 8+ lymphocytes, EBV (+) CD3 + 4 - 8- granulay <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo>, EBV (+) t(14, 22) B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and EBV (-) follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with reactivation type serology were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The detectability of EBV DNA was tested in consecutively sampled <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> IM peripheral cells by Southern blot analysis with Bam HIW, PCR with Bam HIK (EBNA1) and its Southern re-estimation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that EBV DNA was detectable rarely in the earliest samples, and that PCR can increase the sensitivity, as expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The gene expression of IL-2R alpha (-) IL-2R beta (+) and perforin (-) by IM cells were assessed with Northern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The abundant gamma IFN gene expression by IM cells was revealed by reversed PCR </plain></SENT>
