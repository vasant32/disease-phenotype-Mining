<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The t(11;14)(q13;q32) between the BCL-1 and immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH) loci in mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) are believed to be mediated by the mechanism of V(D)J recombination similar to the t(14; 18) in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that the t(14;18) event creates staggered double-strand breaks in the BCL-2 locus, and that the t(14;18) junctions contain templated nucleotide insertions (T-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi>; U </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>JÃ¤ger et al., Blood, 95: 3520-3529, 2000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reasoning that the earlier (pregerminal center) B-cell origin of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> might be reflected in a different molecular structure of the chromosomal breakpoints, we PCR-amplified diagnostic samples from 93 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six samples (39%) were positive for the direct (BCL-1/J(H)) and 23 for both direct and reciprocal (D(H)/BCL-1) junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The breaks on chromosome 14 exhibited features of V(D)J-mediated recombination as shown by D(H) and J(H) coding end processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, duplications of BCL-1 sequences in 39% of the 23 patients indicate staggered double-strand breaks in the major translocation cluster region (MTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is incompatible with V(D)J recombination and indicates a different mechanism of cleavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The use of J(H)6 in the junctions (39%) was similar to that in the immunoglobulin genes of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells and B-CLL, but considerably less than in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 2 of 36 samples contained a BCL-1/DJ(H) rearrangement, which was indicative of a previous DJ(H) rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, 19% of the BCL-1/IgH junctions with inserts of &gt; or =5 nucleotides contained error-prone copies (T-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi>) of 8-12 nucleotides originating from the surrounding BCL-1 or IgH regions, a lower rate than in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the addition of T-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> and the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> in the immunoglobulin genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the t(11;14) and t(14;18) use the same basic mechanism of translocation including V(D)J-mediated recombination, double-strand staggered breaks, and template-dependent, error-prone DNA-synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the distinct differences in the utilization of J(H) regions suggest that the t(11;14) occurs predominantly during an attempted primary D(H)-J(H) rearrangement in early B cells, whereas the t(14;18) mostly occurs during secondary rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This is in agreement with the pregerminal center B-cell origin of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
