<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis showed that the genomic breakpoint is localized between the S(mu) region of the IGH complex and the first intron of BCL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction showed expression of a unique hybrid IGH-BCL2 transcript involving the transcription initiation site I(mu) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the V(H) region of the functional nontranslocated IGH allele showed multiple shared <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> but also a high intraclonal variation (53 differences in 15 clones), compatible with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells staying in or re-entering the germinal center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is the first example of a t(14;18) translocation that results from an illegitimate IGH class-switch recombination during the germinal center B-cell stage </plain></SENT>
