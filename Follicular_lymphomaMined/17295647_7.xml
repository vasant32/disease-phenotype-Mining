<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, approximately 10% of FL cases do not express Bcl2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to compare gene aberrations, prosurvival gene expression, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and proliferation rates in Bcl2-positive and -negative FL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bcl2 translocation and Bcl6 translocation were detected and compared using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A tendency for Bcl6 translocation to occur was found more frequently in Bcl2-negative FL than in the Bcl2-positive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of Bcl-X, BAX, p53, Bcl6 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bcl2 family proteins Bcl-X and BAX were expressed similarly in the two FL types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In some cases of Bcl2-negative FL there was high expression of Bcl6 or p53 but no such Bcl2-positive FL cases were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was an inverse relationship between the expression of Bcl6 and p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the Bcl6 translocation occurs more frequently in Bcl2-negative FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, other prosurvival proteins such as p53 and Bcl6 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Bcl2-negative FL </plain></SENT>
