<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We combined a TLR-9 agonist (1018 ISS, 0.2 mg/kg sc weekly x 4 beginning day 8) with standard rituximab (375 mg/m(2) weekly x 4) in patients (n = 23) with relapsed/refractory, histologically confirmed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and evaluated immunological changes following the combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment was well-tolerated with no significant adverse events attributable to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical responses were observed in 48% of patients; the overall median progression-free survival was 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biologically relevant increases in ADCC and circulating CD-3 positive T cells were observed in 35% and 39% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-five percent of patients had increased T cells and dendritic cells in skin biopsies of 1018 ISS injection sites 24 h post-therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pre- and post-biopsies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue demonstrated an infiltration of CD8(+) T cells and macrophages following treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This group of patients had favourable clinical outcome despite adverse prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study is the first to histologically confirm perturbation of the local immune microenvironment following systemic biological therapy of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
