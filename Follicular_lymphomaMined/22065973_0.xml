<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-five patients who were newly diagnosed as low-grade NHL were treated with fludarabine combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fludarabine combination regimens consisted of fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> or fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> with or without rituximab and repeated every 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age was 60 years (range, 35-77 years), with 13 of 25 patients (52%) ≥60 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven of 25 patients (28%) with an intermediate risk follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> international prognostic index (FLIPI) and 9 of 25 patients (36%) with a high risk FLIPI were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The delivered median number of chemotherapy was six (range, 2-9 cycles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate with fludarabine-based treatment was 88%, including 52% complete remission and 36% partial remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the median follow-up of 19 months, the estimated 2-year event-free survival was 63±10% (95% CI, 43-83) and the 2-year overall survival was 78±9% (95% CI, 60-96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fludarabine combination chemotherapy was frequently associated with grade 3 or 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in 84% patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1167779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neutropenic infection</z:e> was observed in only one (4%) patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients (16%) showed grade 3 or more non-hematologic toxicities, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002531'>anaphylaxis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Fludarabine-combination treatment was a highly active regimen with well toleration in untreated low-grade NHL </plain></SENT>
