<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the impact of adding rituximab to intensive chemotherapy with peripheral-blood progenitor cell (PBPC) autograft for high-risk diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>-CL) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were collected from 10 centers associated with Gruppo Italiano Terapie Innnovative nei Linfomi for 522 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>-CL and 223 patients with FL (median age, 47 years) who received the original or a modified high-dose sequential (HDS) chemotherapy regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HDS was delivered to 396 patients without (R-) and to 349 patients with (R+) rituximab; 154 (39%) and 178 patients (51%) in the R- and R+ subsets, respectively, underwent HDS for relapsed/refractory disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 355 R- (90%) and 309 R+ patients (88%) completed the final PBPC autograft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early treatment-related mortality was 3.3% for R- and 2.8% for R+ (P = not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two parameters significantly influenced the outcome: disease status at HDS, with 5-year overall survival (OS) projections of 69% versus 57% for diagnosis versus refractory/relapsed status, respectively, and rituximab addition, with 5-year OS of 69% versus 60% in the R+ versus R- groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, these two variables maintained an independent prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The marked benefit of rituximab was evident in patients receiving HDS as salvage treatment: the 5-year OS projections for R+ versus R- were, respectively, 64% versus 38%, for patients with refractory disease or early relapse and 71% versus 57%, for patients with late relapse, partial response, or second/third relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this large series indicate that rituximab should be included in the current practice of PBPC autograft for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>-CL and FL </plain></SENT>
