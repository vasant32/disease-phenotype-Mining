<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates the utility of fluorescence-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-SSCP methodologies to monitor the clonal relatedness of cells with bcl-2 major break point region (mbr)/JR fusion sequences in sequential samples from patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence-tagged PCR products from 2-4 sequential samples from seven FL patients were resolved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28619">acrylamide</z:chebi> gels and analyzed on an Applied Biosystems' automated DNA sequencer equipped with Genescan software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The amplicons were sequenced directly using automated DNA sequencing to obtain the precise amplicon size and base sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence-based PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis performed to distinguish amplicons of similar size but of different base sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Amplification products differing by as few as 5 bp resolved clearly under fluorescent PCR assay conditions making possible by visual inspection alone the distinction of two products that otherwise appeared to be of similar size by conventional gel electrophoretic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The size of the amplicons as determined by Genescan software correlated exactly with the sizes generated by sequence analysis confirming the precision and accuracy of the fluorescent PCR assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under nondenaturing conditions, the mobility profiles of the amplicons from sequential samples with identical base sequence remained indistinguishable, whereas amplicons of similar size but of dissimilar base sequence from different patients exhibited distinct migration patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, this study demonstrates that a combination of fluorescent PCR and PCR-SSCP assays for the detection of the t(14;18) provides an accurate measure of clonal relationship based on molecular size and sequence similarities without involving radiolabeling and sequencing strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the demonstrated preservation of junctional sequences across sequential biopsy specimens validates the use of PCR in the monitoring of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> and eliminates concern about the detection of secondary, non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-related translocations </plain></SENT>
