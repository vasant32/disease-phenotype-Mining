<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients have been treated: 14 at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and 18 with relapsed or progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>R-HDS regimens included six courses of rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rituximab was delivered either concurrently with high-dose chemotherapy to exploit the in vivo purging properties of the drug as well as at the end of the treatment plan to target <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients treated at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> completed their treatment with no life-threatening toxicity, while two toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> due to severe bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> were observed among patients treated due to relapsed or refractory disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of 14 patients treated up-front achieved CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among pre-treated patients 10 of 18 achieved CR with better results in patients with relapsed (seven of eight) compared to progressive disease (three of 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PCR analysis was carried out in indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients: nine of nine follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and three of six CD5-positive NHL collected PCR-negative peripheral blood progenitor cell harvests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of this pilot study show that R-HDS is feasible and effective with acceptable toxicity when used at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In pre-treated patients this treatment also showed promising results, although the risk of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> needs to be considered </plain></SENT>
