<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is based on an interdisciplinary consensus and contains background information and definitions as well as specified indications and detailed contraindications of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Essential topics are the requirements for institutions performing the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For instance, presence of an expert for medical physics, intense cooperation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> colleagues committed to treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and a certificate of instruction in radiochemical labelling and quality control are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it is specified which patient data have to be available prior to performance of therapy and how treatment has to be carried out technically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, quality control and documentation of labelling are of great importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After treatment, clinical quality control is mandatory (work-up of therapy data and follow-up of patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Essential elements of follow-up are specified in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The complete treatment inclusive after-care has to be realised in close cooperation with those colleagues (hemato-oncologists) who propose, in general, radioimmunotherapy under consideration of the development of the disease </plain></SENT>
