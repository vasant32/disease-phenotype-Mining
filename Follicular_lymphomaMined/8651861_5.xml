<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of its rarity, little information is available on the prognostic or therapeutic implications of histologic transformation of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to a "blastic" form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report a case of a 68-year-old man whose mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> transformed into a high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with blastic cytology, which was associated with an extremely rapid clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis revealed the immunophenotype of the original <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which had typical mantle cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and the subsequent bone marrow aspirate was virtually identical, as was the immunophenotype of the small cells versus the blastic cells in the subsequent specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rapid clinical course in the patient reported here is similar to that of other rare cases reported and suggests that mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in blastic transformation appears to be a very aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with a clinical course similar to that of other low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in histologic transformation </plain></SENT>
