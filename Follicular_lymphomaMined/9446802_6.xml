<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A new DR3 variant (DR3 beta) was characterized by 2 insertions of respectively 20- and 7-base pairs (bp) which result in a predictive translated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> differing from the described DR3 molecule by a 28 amino-acid stretch in the extracellular domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DR3 was shown to be expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples tested, whereas DR3 beta expression was restricted to lymphoid T-cell and immature B-cell lines and to selected cases with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data provide new insight into the molecular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of DR3, suggesting the presence of several receptor isoforms that can participate in lymphoid cell homeostasis </plain></SENT>
