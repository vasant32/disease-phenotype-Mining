<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow (BM) infiltration by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> occurs in 40-70% of cases at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The characteristic chromosomal translocation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is t(14;18)(q32;q21) with transposition of BCL2 oncogene to the regulatory region of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene IgH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aim of this study was to determine the frequency of PCR detection of IgH/BCL2 in DNA samples isolated from archival cytological slides of lymph node aspirates, bone marrow and/or peripheral blood (PB) obtained from patients with histologically confirmed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> using primers and protocol proposed by BIOMED-2 consortium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also compared molecular with cytomorphological findings in bone marrow/peripheral blood and tested this method of detection of IgH/BCL2 molecular marker in monitoring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) in routine clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA was successfully isolated from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> archival cytological slides obtained by fine needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> of lymph nodes as well as from 75% of smears of bone marrow aspirates from 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fusion oncogene was detected in 10 of 19 patients (52%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For patients with PCR IgH/BCL2 positive lymph nodes, molecular test found BM infiltration in 5 cases (83%), while cytomorphology detected infiltration in three of eight cases (37%) available for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>May-Gr√ºnwald-Giemsa stained cytological smears can be used for PCR-based ancillary methods and the rate of detection of IgH/BCL2 rearrangement is similar to results reported for paraffin-embedded tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For patients with detectable baseline molecular marker, PCR is a highly suitable method for detection of bone marrow involvement and monitoring <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
