<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This dose-escalation study examines the safety, pharmacokinetics and biologic effects of multiple doses of anti-CD22 human-murine chimeric monoclonal antibody SM03 in 21 Chinese patients with CD22-positive non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of drug-related adverse events (AEs) were mild and reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients experienced serious AEs (<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>); one patient had grade 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>; one patient had asymptomatic grade III prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Major AEs included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (71%), prolongation of APTT (42.8%), <z:mp ids='MP_0000221'>leukocytopenia</z:mp> (44.4%), alanine transaminase elevation (28.6%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003259'>elevated serum creatinine</z:hpo> (23.8%) and injection site skin redness (14.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Circulating B cells transiently decreased without significant effects on T cells or immunoglobulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic data revealed that mean maximum observed SM03 concentration and mean AUC from time zero to infinity increased in a dose-dependent manner up to 360 mg/m ( 2) SM03 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean clearance was similar at doses â‰¤ 360 mg/m ( 2) and decreased significantly at dose 480 mg/m ( 2) , supporting saturation of B-cell binding at 360 mg/m ( 2)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dose levels and histologies, one patient achieved partial response at 480 mg/m ( 2) dose; 14 patients had stable disease as best response and four patients progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, SM03 was tolerated at doses ranging from 60-480 mg/m ( 2) and had potential efficacy in Chinese patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
