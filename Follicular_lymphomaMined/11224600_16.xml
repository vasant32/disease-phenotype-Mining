<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The histogenesis, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, immunophenotype, and clinical behavior of cutaneous large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (CLBCL) are largely a matter of controversy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed an investigation to determine whether CLBCL have features that differentiate them from other large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and whether CLBCL is itself a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To this end, we reviewed the main characteristics of a series of 32 cases of LBCL found in the skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the clinical findings and paraffin sections of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from these 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemical study performed included p53, MIB1, Bcl2, Bcl6, and CD10 markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We carried out statistical analysis of these data (univariate and multivariate), seeking an association between the features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and clinical outcome, as defined by failure-free survival time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one patient died as a consequence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the accumulated probability of survival without failure at 48 months was 0.46 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number, type, and localization of the lesions were not associated with variations in either survival or failure-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression of p53 was negative in this group of CLBCL, whereas Bcl-2 expression or localization in the lower leg did not relate to any other significant feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histologic examination of the cases disclosed three different groups: Grade III follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs), monomorphous large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (LBCL type I), and LBCL with an admixed component of small B-lymphocytes (LBCL type II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Grade III FL (11 cases) tended to be found in the head and neck and showed CD10 expression in a majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A higher probability of lymph node relapses was associated with cases located in the head and neck and with CD10+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Cutaneous large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are indolent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, but follow an insidious course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our data support the interpretation that CLBCL is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> condition; comprises some LBCL derived from CD10+ germinal center cells which manifests more frequently as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in the head and neck region, with an increased probability of relapse in lymph nodes [1] and has some distinctive morphologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The existence of a component of small B-cells within the other CLBCL could lend support to the theory that some of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, more than arise de novo, may have originated in preexistent small B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, but no firm evidence of this is provided in this study </plain></SENT>
