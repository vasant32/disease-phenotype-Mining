<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In recent years, various protocols to quantify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients have been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These assays assume that PCR efficiencies are equal for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Determining t(14;18) and albumin reaction efficiencies for sixteen follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patient samples revealed higher efficiencies for blood samples than for lymph node samples in general </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, within one sample both reactions had equivalent efficiencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences in amplification efficiencies between patient samples (low efficiencies) and the calibrator in quantitative analyses result in the underestimation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> in patient samples whereby the weakest positive patient samples are at highest error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings for patient samples, the efficiency compensation control was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This control includes two reference reactions in a multiplex setting, specific for the beta-actin and albumin housekeeping genes that are present in a constant ratio within DNA templates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference in threshold cycle values for both reference reactions, ie, the Ct(2) value, is dependent on the amplification efficiency, and is used to compensate for efficiency differences between patient samples and the calibrator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The beta-actin reference reaction is also used to normalize for DNA input </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the efficiency compensation control facilitates identification of patient samples that are so contaminated with PCR inhibitory compounds that different amplification reactions are affected to a different extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Accurate quantitation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> in these samples is therefore impossible with the current quantitative real-time PCR protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Identification and exclusion of these inadequate samples will be of utmost importance in quantitative retrospective studies, but even more so, in future molecular diagnostic analyses </plain></SENT>
