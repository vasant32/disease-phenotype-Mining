<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its expression in hematolymphoid cells had not been examined previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors studied <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> immunoreactivity in nonneoplastic lymphoid tissues from 26 lymph nodes, 3 tonsils, and 2 spleens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statin</z:chebi> was detected primarily in small lymphoid cells and histiocytes, along with such accessory elements as fibroblasts and endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The distribution of positive cells showed an inverse correlation with the proliferative activity of the various lymphoid compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statin</z:chebi> labeling was also quantified in 15 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and compared with that in hyperplastic follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although reactivity in benign germinal centers was less than that in neoplastic follicles, this difference did not prove statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statin</z:chebi> provides an alternative to proliferation-associated parameters, such as Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, in the analysis of hematolymphoid processes and may be helpful in the dissection of their kinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
