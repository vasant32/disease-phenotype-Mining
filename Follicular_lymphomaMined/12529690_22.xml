<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The translocation (14;18)(q32;q21) is the hallmark of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, conventional cytogenetics and PCR techniques fail to detect it in at least 10% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate the true incidence of this translocation in FL, we analyzed 63 patients with FL, and 17 patients with diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL) corresponding to suspected FL transformations using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Colocalized signals related to the translocation were observed in 19-92% of cells (median = 51%), corresponding to positivity over the threshold in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (63/63) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, 16/17 possibly secondary DLCL displayed the translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although some cytogenetic changes might be missed by this FISH assay (such as rare insertion, or translocations with other chromosomal partners), our results stress t(14;18)(q32;q21) as an almost constant finding in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our sensitive interphase FISH assay should be of great value to define FL more accurately, namely in patients included into therapeutic trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this approach could be of interest in (re)defining some types of FL, especially the grade 3 FL which frequently lack t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
