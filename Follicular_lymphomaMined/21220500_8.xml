<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>GA101 is a novel glycoengineered Type II CD20 monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When compared with rituximab, it mediates less complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As expected for a Type II antibody, GA101 appears not to act through CDC and is more potent than the Type I antibody rituximab in inducing cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> via nonclassical induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> cytotoxicity, with more direct cytotoxicity and more antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the antitumor activity of GA101 against the human-transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> RL model in vivo in severe combined immunodeficient mice (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GA101 induced stronger inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> than rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combination of GA101 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> in vivo confirmed the superiority of GA101 over rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neutralizing the complement system with cobra venom factor partially impaired the antitumor activity of rituximab, but had no impact on the efficacy of GA101 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro GA101 more potently induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of RL cells than rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of a limited number of genes was found to be induced by both antibodies after exposure in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among these, early growth response 1 and activation transcription factor 3 were confirmed to be increased at the protein level, suggesting a possible role of these proteins in the apoptotic signalling of anti-CD20 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data imply that GA101 is superior to rituximab not only as a single agent, but also in combination with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data suggest the presence of novel signalization pathways activated after exposure to anti-CD20 antibodies </plain></SENT>
