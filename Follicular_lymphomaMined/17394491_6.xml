<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Protein kinase C (PKC) beta is an important regulator of lymphoid survival and its expression has been shown to be altered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to determine the expression of PKC beta(2) in various subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative diseases</z:e> by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and forty archival samples representing various subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative diseases</z:e> were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Certain subtypes, such as mantle cell, lymphocytic or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, were found to express PKC beta(2) in &gt; 90% of the samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the follicular lymphomatous areas were constantly labelled, whereas residual germinal centres remained negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo>, PKC beta(2)+ cells were found in the mantle and marginal zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most angioimmunoblastic T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, lymphoblastic T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and marginal zone/mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were labelled with anti-PKC betaII antibody, but the pattern of expression was more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> in these subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A minority of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were stained and most plasma cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> expressed PKC beta(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PKC beta(2) expression varies significantly among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In our series, the highest level of expression was found in mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
