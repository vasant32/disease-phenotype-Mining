<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to the amount of small lymphocytes in the parafollicular lymphoid tissue (PSL), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were classified: PSL++, abundant lymphocytes with prominent postcapillary venules; PSL+, a number of lymphocytes readily recognizable, postcapillary venules present but not prominent; PSL+/-, lymphocytes barely appreciable or absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five-year actuarial survival rates were 82.7% in PSL++, 42.3% in PSL+, and 0% in PSL+/- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten-year actuarial survival rates were 51.5% and 4.7% in PSL++ and +, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PSL++ pattern was often associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients surviving more than 5 years with disseminated disease had either PSL++ or + </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival was better correlated with PSL patterns than histologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types or clinical stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transition of the pattern from nodular to diffuse occurred in 17 of 26 cases observed and was concomitant with the progressive loss of parafollicular (or interfollicular) components, namely small lymphocytes and lymphocyte-associated vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Classification of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> based on parafollicular small lymphocytes (PSL) offers a new set of prognostic criteria and a guide to improved clinical management </plain></SENT>
