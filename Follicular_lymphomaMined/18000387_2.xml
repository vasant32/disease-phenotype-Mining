<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) constitutes the neoplastic equivalent of germinal center B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Like its physiological counterpart, FL grows in (atypical) follicular structures, the formation of which is as yet poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent data indicate that in early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> stages, neoplastic FL cells home to and colonise reactive germinal centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laser microdissection (LMD) and micromanipulation techniques now allow for the molecular genetic analysis of single cell mutation patterns in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was the analysis of the sequence and order of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in FL, i.e. the influence of the germinal center microenvironment on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> in different grades of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By generating phylogenetic trees as calculated from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell sequences, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> from a putative progenitor cell was elucidated and finally, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">tumour cell migration</z:e> pattern in disease progression was assessed by analyzing biopsies at different time points in relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients suffering from FL were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A primary FL grade 1 showed clustering of genetically related subclones in distinct follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A moderate interfollicular exchange of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three cases of FL grade 2 were found to show decreased subclonal clustering in follicles and an increase in the interfollicular migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Accumulations of replacement mutations in antigen binding domains (CDR) and silent mutations in non-antigen binding domains (FR), respectively, indicating antigen influence on hypermutation were only found in the case of FL grade 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our conclusion is that the microenvironment in germinal centers exercises influence on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell distribution patterns in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>With increasing histologic grade during disease progression, a reduced intraclonal diversity and selection of subclones also occurs outside the setting of transformation to high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Antigen-dependent hypermutations were only seen in FL grade 1, while in progressed FL, random mutation patterns and a decrease of clonal diversity were found </plain></SENT>
