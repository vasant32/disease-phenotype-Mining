<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We wanted to know if a similar benefit could be demonstrated in the routine data of a regional population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We searched the registry of the Regensburg <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> Center for B cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> diagnosed between 1998 and 2006 and compared overall survival of patients receiving any first-line chemotherapy with or without rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparing registry data to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates, an 86% coverage within the registry was estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> group, 133 patients received rituximab-containing chemotherapy resulting in a 5-year survival of 69.6%, whereas 205 patients received chemotherapy alone with a significantly inferior 5-year survival of 56.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>First-line chemotherapy with rituximab in 81 patients with indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> also led to improved 5-year survival compared to 134 patients without rituximab (69.7% vs. 51.8%), primarily observed among patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (84.7% vs. 52.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data confirm the standard use of rituximab as first-line therapy in diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> as well as in indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, they support the collection of treatment data including detailed information on systemic therapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries to be used for outcomes research </plain></SENT>
