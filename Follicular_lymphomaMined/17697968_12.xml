<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in the treatment of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is still being defined in the era of antibody therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report the long-term 12-year clinical outcomes of patients treated with autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) for follicular non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) in first remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between 1988 and 1993, advanced-stage follicular NHL patients in need of initial therapy were enrolled in 2 consecutive prospective treatment trials of either standard-dose CHOP induction (83 patients) or high-dose CHOP plus granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (20 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who achieved an adequate remission with induction therapy underwent conditioning with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and total body irradiation (TBI) followed by ABMT in first remission using bone marrow (BM) purged in vitro with anti-B cell monoclonal antibodies and rabbit complement (96 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 12-year follow-up, 61% of the patients are alive and 43% remain in continuing complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The only predictors of decreased progression-free survival proved to be histologic BM involvement at time of harvest (hazard ratio [HR] 2.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-3.9, P&lt;.004) and PCR detectable disease in the BM product after purging (HR 4.18, 95% CI 1.99-8.8, P=.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant predictors of overall survival were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results at 12-year follow-up suggest that a subset of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients can experience prolonged survival with ABMT in first remission </plain></SENT>
