<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis was performed with a panel of DNA probes to detect rearrangements of c-myc, bcl-1, bcl-2 and bcl-3 in 14 cases of B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) with a clonal cytogenetic rearrangement involving the chromosome 14q32 locus and no known donor chromosome [t(14;?)(q32;?)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our experience, 21% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> chromosomal abnormalities involving the 14q32 locus in B-cell NHL are of this type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found oncogene rearrangements in five of the 14 cases: bcl-1 rearrangement on one mantle zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, bcl-2 rearrangements in two follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and c-myc rearrangements in two small noncleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a 14q32+ abnormality of unknown origin is a relatively frequent karyotypic finding in B-cell NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one third of the cases, known oncogenes that have been previously described in reciprocal translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus were shown to be involved in the 14q32+ abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The translocations in the other cases are likely to have involved one of the above oncogenes with breakpoints not revealed by the probes employed, other known oncogenes, or oncogenes that have not yet been identified </plain></SENT>
