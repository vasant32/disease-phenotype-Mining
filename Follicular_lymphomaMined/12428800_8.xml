<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 260 bone marrow trephine biopsy specimens involved by follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we identified 12 cases with a follicular pattern of bone marrow involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The paratrabecular pattern was not present at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in 9, and it accounted for less than 10% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Malignant follicles in the bone marrow were similar to malignant follicles in the respective lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follicular dendritic cells were identified by immunohistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The true follicular pattern of bone marrow involvement by follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> seems to be more frequent in women than in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is important to recognize this pattern of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the bone marrow because it is possible to misinterpret interstitial lymphoid aggregates as benign in the absence of the more characteristic paratrabecular pattern </plain></SENT>
