<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated a series of 41 consecutive patients with bone marrow involvement for whom no other diagnostic tissues were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sections were stained with the following antibodies: CD3, CD20, CD79a, CD5, CD10, CD23, anti-cyclin D1 and kappa and lambda light chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antigen retrieval was performed using either a microwave oven or a pressure cooker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Labelling was performed with an avidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-peroxidase labelling system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A final diagnosis was reached in 37 out of 41 cases (90%): B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (15 cases), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (10 cases), mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (eight cases) and lymphoplasmacytoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytoma</z:e> (four cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the remaining four cases, a generic diagnosis of low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotyping of formalin-fixed marrow is a useful technique for diagnosing most of the low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
