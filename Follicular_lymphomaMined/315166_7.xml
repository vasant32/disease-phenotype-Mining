<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nonneoplastic tissues (peripheral blood, lymph nodes, spleens, tonsils, thymus, and pleural fluid) and specimens from various <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079734" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphosarcoma</z:e> cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of B-and T-cell types, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T (E-rosetting) cells demonstrated several patterns of NAE reactivity: 1) a strong globular reaction product, the most specific pattern for T-cell identification, 2) granular cytoplasmic staining, or 3) no reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>B lymphocytes revealed a granular pattern of NAE staining, were devoid of enzyme, or, in rare instances, exhibited strong NAE activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Percentages of lymphoid cells with strong (globular) NAE activity closely paralleled T-cell (E-rosette) values in the majority of cases, with the best correlations observed for peripheral blood studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, discordant results were noted for some neoplastic and nonneoplastic tissues, including cases of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Markedly discrepant results were noted for thymic lymphocytes, most of which revealed E-rosette formation and weak or absent NAE activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lymph nodes involved by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> demonstrated a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> pattern of staining in E-rosetting cells and in Reed-Sternberg variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cryostat section studies of reactive lymph nodes and nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> demonstrated strong NAE staining in lymphoid cells of T-cell (interfollicular, internodular) areas, with little or no positivity in follicles or nodules (B-cell areas) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NAE staining patterns further suggested that T cells comprise part of the follicular cuff and possibly represent a minor population of some neoplastic nodules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although NAE determinations do not represent a consistently reliable alternative to immunologic methods for T-cell identification, this easily applicable cytochemical marker is complementary to other techniques in assessing neoplastic or nonneoplastic tissues, particularly cryostat sections </plain></SENT>
