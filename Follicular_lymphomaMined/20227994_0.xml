<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 2002, we introduced the modified R-ESHAP regimen in which <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> was switched to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="31355">carboplatin</z:chebi>. we evaluated the safety and effectiveness of this modified regimen by reviewing the records of 35 patients who had been administered R-ESHAP </plain></SENT>
