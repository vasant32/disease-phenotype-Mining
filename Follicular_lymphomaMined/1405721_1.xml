<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied the immunophenotypic features in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and investigated the suitability of classification according to guidelines of the French-American-British (FAB) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotyping was carried out on cytocentrifuge preparations of mononuclear blood leukocytes using the alkaline phosphatase-antialkaline phosphatase (APAAP) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 114 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath>, including 58 cases of B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (B-CLL), 3 Waldenstr√∂m's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024419" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">macroglobulinaemia</z:e>, 6 prolymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (B-PL), 13 B-CLL/PL, 4 B-CLL of mixed cell type, 8 splenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with villous lymphocytes (SLVL), 8 hairy cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (HCL), two HCL variant, three leukaemic phase of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, two leukaemic phase of intermediate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, two plasma cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 111 of 112 B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> (B-CLL + B-PL + B-CLL/PL + SLVL + HCL etc.) showed monotypic light chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antibody HML1 was highly specific for HCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The antibodies CD11c and CD25 were positive in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> HCL cases, but were not specific for this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD5 positivity and CD22s negativity were found in most patients with B-CLL, B-CLL/PL and B-CLL of mixed type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This marker type has a limited value for differentiation from the other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also studied three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> which were not described by the FAB classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a study of the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the leukaemic cells was the most useful basis for the diagnosis of these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath>, whereas immunotyping was apparently valuable only in individual cases </plain></SENT>
