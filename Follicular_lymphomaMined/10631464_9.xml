<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The capacity of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect very low numbers of cells bearing a t(14;18) translocation has led to its application in assessment of the results of treatment for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and suggestions that therapy might be guided by molecular studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test the reliability of PCR a collaborative study was undertaken to compare results from different laboratories in Europe and North America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty laboratories with records of publication in molecular diagnostics were sent blood from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors with varying numbers of t(14;18)-bearing cells added from a cell line with a translocation in the major breakpoint region (MBR) of the bcl-2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Samples contained 1000, 100, 10, 1 or 0 cells per ml of whole blood and were sent blinded in duplicate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PCR methodology varied widely, with the total number of amplification cycles between 30 and 70, and 13 different primers used for the MBR region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve laboratories used nested PCR and eight single round amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sensitivity of nested and single round PCR was similar at 100 cells/ml but below this the nested method proved significantly more sensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The false positive rate was 28%, with 11 samples from 9 laboratories reported as positive when no t(14;18) cells were added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PCR product size and sequence analysis showed that false positives were due to contamination from cell-line DNA rather than background translocations in the donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in false positive rates between nested and single round techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The polymerase chain reaction to detect bcl-2-IgH rearrangements is presently carried out with widely disparate results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further effort is required to bring forward a standard PCR protocol which can be re-tested in different laboratories to improve accuracy and reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The application of quantitative techniques such as real-time PCR may resolve many of the problems presently encountered </plain></SENT>
