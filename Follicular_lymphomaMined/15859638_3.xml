<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initial presentation of disease in this site (primary retroperitoneal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) is considered to be rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of the uncommon anatomic location, the diagnosis and subsequent management of these patients tend to be difficult for both pathologists and clinicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This report describes our experience during a period of 6 years 4 months with patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> primarily presenting in the retroperitoneum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective search of our medical records generated 32 patients who presented initially with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> or discomfort as their predominant symptom and who were found by imaging studies to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267771" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">retroperitoneal mass</z:e> or masses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the histopathology slides were reviewed and classified based on the World Health Organization classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 13 male and 19 female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> types included diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 12); grade 1 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 4); grade 3 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 1); B <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 2); <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (n = 1); mixed-cellularity Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 1); nodular <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 1); aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 4); low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 4); lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, null cell type (n = 1); and precursor B-lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More than half of the cases (17/32) were diagnosed on needle biopsy with immunophenotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although open lymph node biopsy is a preferred method for diagnosis, needle biopsy plays a significant role in this setting, and, coupled with other information such as flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, it is considered a practical and reliable method </plain></SENT>
