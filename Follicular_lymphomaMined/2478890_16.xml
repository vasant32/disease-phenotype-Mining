<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Translocation of bcl-2 sequences from chromosome 18 to the JH segment of the immunoglobulin gene at chromosome band 14q32 in B cells results in deregulated expression of this gene, causing high steady state levels of bcl-2 messenger RNA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA sequence data indicate that bcl-2 encodes two proteins by virtue of alternative splicing, designated as Bcl-2 alpha and Bcl-2 beta, with relative molecular masses of 26,000 and 22,000 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell fractionation experiments indicate that the bcl-2 alpha gene product is located at the inner surface of the cell membrane, suggesting a possible role in mitogenic signal transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report here that Bcl-2 alpha has <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi>-binding activity and a protein sequence that suggests it belongs to the small molecular weight <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi>-binding protein (G protein) family </plain></SENT>
