<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The prognostic significance of specific cytogenetic abnormalities in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is an area of ongoing research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A small percentage of FL are characterized by a polyploid karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several studies have analyzed ploidy level to determine its role as an independent prognostic factor in non-Hodgkins <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, with equivocal results, mostly using DNA flow cytometry to ascertain ploidy status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have performed cytogenetic analyses on 180 cases of FL with a t(14;18) diagnosed between 1980 and 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases were divided into a polyploid group (20 cases) and a non-polyploid group (160 cases), <z:mp ids='MP_0004025'>polyploidy</z:mp> defined as a modal chromosome number of 58 or greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each group included examples of the 3 subtypes of FL, [Working Formulation]: 1) follicular small cleaved cell (FSC), 2) follicular mixed, small and large cell (FM), and 3) follicular large cell (FLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up time was 38.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The histological subclassification of the polyploid group revealed much less FSC (30% vs 66%, p &lt; 0.004) and much more FLC (25% vs 4%, p &lt; 0.003) than the non-polyploid group, implying histological progression may occur in parallel with the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0004025'>polyploidy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recognized clinical prognostic factors were evenly distributed between the two groups and no survival difference was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We show that <z:mp ids='MP_0004025'>polyploidy</z:mp> as determined by classical cytogenetics is present in different frequencies across the subtypes of FL with a t(14;18), but is not an independent prognostic factor for survival in FL </plain></SENT>
