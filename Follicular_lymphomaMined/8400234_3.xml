<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To better understand the role of the BCL-3 locus at chromosome 17q22 in the pathogenesis and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, we examined its genomic configuration in 264 B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and its expression in a smaller subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cases studied included 39 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo>, 58 low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 20 mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 30 small noncleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 25 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo>, 10 acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndrome--related non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and 44 diffuse mixed- or diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, 38 aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) derived from previously indolent follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis showed BCL-3 locus rearrangement in 4 cases (1.5%), ie, in 3 transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and in 1 indolent follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 also had BCL-2 rearrangements consistent with their follicular center cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the BCL-3 rearranged cases showed MYC gene rearrangement, as reported for the original <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> that led to the discovery of BCL-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretransformation specimens of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed the presence of the BCL-3 alteration before histologic progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 1 case, serial pretransformation biopsies showed that the BCL-3 rearrangement was acquired during the indolent follicular phase of the patient's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including 2 of the 4 with BCL-3 rearrangement, were also examined for BCL-3 message </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 30, including the 2 with BCL-3 rearrangements, expressed the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 1.7-kb BCL-3 transcript, at approximately equivalent levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that, although BCL-3 locus alterations are found in only a small fraction of B-cell lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, they occur primarily in a subset of follicular center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these alterations appear to be acquired during the indolent (follicular) phase of the disease and they are maintained when histologic transformation takes place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The data also suggest that BCL-3 locus alterations do not result in gross changes of BCL-3 gene expression and do not necessarily involve the MYC gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although the preferential involvement of BCL-3 alterations in a small subset of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that transform suggests a possible link between these abnormalities and progression, further studies are needed to ensure that these alterations are biologically relevant and not simply a manifestation of genomic instability </plain></SENT>
