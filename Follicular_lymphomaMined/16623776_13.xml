<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ki67 immunohistochemistry allows evaluation of the distribution of proliferating cells in addition to simply determining the proliferation rate of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Three observers, using a Ki67-stained slide only, studied 149 cases from five diagnostic groupings: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo>, mixed pattern <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, localized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017531" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GLNH|AFLH">Castleman's disease</z:e>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity for benign lesions varied from 94% to 97% among the three observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were recognized as neoplastic with a sensitivity of 96% and 100% by two of the observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was recognized as neoplastic in 67-73% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Ki67 stain alone is a powerful tool for distinguishing benign from malignant proliferations within the selected groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nuances and pitfalls in the interpretation of Ki67 staining pattern are discussed </plain></SENT>
