<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found that the transferrin receptor is expressed by a wide variety of B- and T-lineage non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The OKT9 staining also was loosely correlated with the three morphologic grades of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> identified by the International Working Formulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In general, higher grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> more often and more intensely expressed the T9 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, transferrin receptor expression by certain histologic subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> did not correlate with their morphologic grade: low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> expressed the T9 antigen more frequently than diffuse low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; diffuse small cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were stained by OKT9 less often than other histologic subtypes of intermediate-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; and diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> expressed transferrin receptors less often than the other high-grade histologic subtypes of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intermediate lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, not recognized in the International Working Formulation, were infrequently and weakly stained by OKT9 in a manner similar to diffuse low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We obtained clinical follow-up data on 43 individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 64 individuals with diffuse large cell and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
