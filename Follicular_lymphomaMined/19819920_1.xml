<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) combines the use of targeted monoclonal antibodies with radionuclides for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), taking advantage of its inherent radiosensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A number of trials have shown significantly higher response rates and longer progression-free survival times in patients treated with the CD20-targeted radioimmunoconjugate <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">yttrium</z:chebi>-90-ibritumomab tiuxetan compared with the standard of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these benefits have also been shown in heavily pretreated patients who relapsed or were resistant to rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Currently, a number of different treatment regimens and strategies are available for the treatment of NHL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in an attempt to minimize toxicity, maximize efficacy, and improve survival, it is crucial to appropriately select patients who are good candidates for individual treatment approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A strategy for patient selection has been developed, including the use of existing patient assessment tools, such as the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index, to determine the optimal regimen for patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> according to their disease characteristics and physical condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who are fit make ideal candidates for potentially curative regimens, which include induction chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy followed by RIT consolidation and, potentially, maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients who are considered "compromised" would also benefit from induction treatment and RIT consolidation, with a view to reducing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> burden and decreasing the risk for disease progression. "Frail" patients would be better suited to supportive therapy to control symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This paper explores factors that should be considered when assessing whether a patient is a good candidate for treatment with RIT, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> physicians in the selection of the most appropriate therapy for each patient group </plain></SENT>
