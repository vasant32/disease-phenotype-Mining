<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Kinetics of 5-ALA-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi> accumulation in DHL cells under various 5-ALA concentrations was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that during the course of continuous incubation with 5-ALA, the relationship between the DHL cell fluorescence signal and the incubation time showed a biphasic variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initially the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi> signal increased with the incubation time and reached the maximal value at about 3 h, and then it decreased with time during the subsequent incubation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By labeling the 5-ALA incubated DHL cells with different organelle-specific fluorescence probes: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8828">Rhodamine 123</z:chebi> (for mitochondria), DioC6(3) (for endoplasmic reticulum) and LysoTracker Green (for lysosomes) respectively, we found that 5-ALA-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi> was primarily localized in endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria; its concentration in the lysosome was much lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that 5-ALA could potentially be an effective photosensitizer in photodynamic purging of DHL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> excitation fluorescence microscope is a useful tool for studying 5-ALA-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36159">PpIX</z:chebi> subcellular localization </plain></SENT>
