<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in the presence of antibodies to HCV, as well as of HCV-specific genomes has been reported in the sera of over 37% patients with B-NHL, not associated with MC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we decided to perform both a serologic and a molecular study to give insights into a possible relationship between HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and neoplastic lymphoproliferations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used ELISA and RIBA tests to show that anti-HCV antibodies were present in the serum of 29 out of 69 unselected B-NHL patients (42%), while seropositivity in a healthy population was about 1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies was low in definite subsets of B lymphoid disorders, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, Waldenstr√∂m's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024419" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">macroglobulinemia</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278494" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MGUS">monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then, using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, we detected HCV sequences directly in the pathologic lymph node biopsies in 13 out of 34 B-NHL cases, and in particular in six out of eight low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of MALT type and in five out of eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e>-centrocytic follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the peripheral blood samples from 10 B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> patients resulted negative for the presence of HCV genomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> sequences were absent in 10 T cell NHL, while only one out of the 14 Hodgkin's disease cases tested resulted positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, we used a PCR-based assay to characterize the genotypes (I-IV) present in the positive lymphomatous tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of both serologic and molecular markers of HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in a high percentage of certain types of B-NHL, not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100778'>cryoglobulinemia</z:hpo>, and its absence from other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative diseases</z:e> extends the spectrum of HCV-associated lymphoproliferations arguing in favor of some role of this <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in the pathogenesis of the malignant proliferation of definite B lymphoid populations </plain></SENT>
