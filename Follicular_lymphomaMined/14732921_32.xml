<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is characterized by the activation of BCL2 through t(14;18)(q32;q21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additional acquired mutations are necessary to generate a fully malignant clonal proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many of these secondary genetic alterations are visible in the clonal karyotype; however, the sequence by which they arise and their influence on clinical behavior have not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ability to address these issues has been hampered by the lack of computational methods to manipulate complex chromosomal data in a sufficiently large cohort of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present investigation, we analyzed secondary karyotypic alterations in 336 cases of FL with t(14;18) to identify the most common regions of recurrent chromosomal gain or loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This revealed 29 recurrent changes present in more than 5% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> karyotype was then assessed for the presence or absence of each of these 29 specific changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By statistical means, we show that the chromosomal changes arise in an apparent temporal order, with distinct early and late changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We identify, by principal-components analysis, four possible cytogenetic pathways that characterize the early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e>, which converge to a common route at later stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We show that FLs with t(14;18) may be classified into cytogenetic subgroups determined by the presence or absence of 6q-, +7, or der(18)t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Correlation with clinical outcomes in a subset of cases with clinical data revealed del(17p) and +12 to be correlated with an adverse clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The clinical implications of these pathways of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> need to be examined on a prospective basis in a large cohort of FLs </plain></SENT>
