<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The B7/BB1 molecule has recently been found to be expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells and to be the natural ligand for CD28 and CTLA-4 on T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On binding of B7/BB1, CD28 transduces a signal that synergizes with triggering of the T-cell antigen receptor, resulting in enhanced cytokine secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In view of the data supporting an antigen-presenting function of Reed-Sternberg cells, we evaluated the expression of B7/BB1 in lymph nodes affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>B7/BB1 was found to be strongly expressed by the Reed-Sternberg cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 47 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Reed-Sternberg cells were frequently surrounded by CD28-expressing T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evidence for a functional role of B7/BB1 on Reed-Sternberg cells was obtained by our findings that T-cell proliferation and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production in the primary allogenic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), using the B7/BB1-expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>-derived cell lines L428 and KM-H2 as stimulators, could be partially blocked by adding anti-B7 monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>B7/BB1 expression was also evaluated in a group of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (n = 46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas B7/BB1 was not expressed by the neoplastic cells of most non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including T-cell-rich B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 11), it was present on the neoplastic cells of anaplastic large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Ki-1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) (n = 5) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data provide further evidence for an accessory cell function of Reed-Sternberg cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The accessory cell function of Reed-Sternberg cells might lead to pronounced T-cell activation in vivo, which might contribute to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, our study indicates that B7/BB1 may be a useful marker for differentiating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> from morphologically similar conditions such as T-cell-rich B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
