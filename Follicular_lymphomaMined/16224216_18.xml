<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proliferation index (PI) of FL generally correlates with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade; however, in cases of discordance, it is not clear whether histologic grade or PI correlates with clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To objectively evaluate these cases, we determined PI by Ki-67 immunostaining in 142 cases of FL (48 grade 1, 71 grade 2, and 23 grade 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 24 cases FL with low histologic grade but high PI (LG-HPI) were identified, a frequency of 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On histologic examination, LG-HPI FL often exhibited blastoid features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with LG-HPI FL had inferior disease-specific survival but a higher 5-year disease-free rate than low-grade FL with concordantly low PI (LG-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LPI</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, transformation to diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was uncommon in LG-HPI cases (1 of 19; 5%) as compared with LG-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LPI</z:e> cases (27 of 74; 36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, LG-HPI FL appears to be a subgroup of FL with clinical behavior more akin to grade 3 FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that these LG-HPI FL cases should be classified separately from cases of low histologic grade FL with concordantly low PI </plain></SENT>
