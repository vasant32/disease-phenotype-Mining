<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have carried out chromosome analysis in a series of 16 non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) cases in leukemic phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses in these patients based on histology and immunologic markers were as follows: follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), 3 cases; mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Mc), 4 cases; lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (LPL), 8 cases, and large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have shown that the t(14;18), t(11;14), and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 12 retained their subtype association with FL, Mc, and LPL, respectively, as in their nonleukemic counterparts with one case of FL showing t(1;19)(q23;p13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the four LPL cases without <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 12, one case each showed t(12;14)(q13;q32), <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 14, t(1;3)(p34;q21), and del(3)(q21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The t(1;19) and t(12;14) may represent rare events in FL and LPL, respectively, and may be uniquely associated with the leukemic phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint 14q32 was the most common single breakpoint involved, sometimes involving both chromosome 14 homologues depicting its association with primary and secondary genetic events in the disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to the main abnormalities, we have shown additional complex abnormalities in 14 of 16 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among these, chromosome 3 was the most commonly involved, affecting the short or long arm or the whole chromosome; 5 of the 16 cases involved breakpoint 3q21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The high incidence of additional abnormalities in these NHL in leukemic phase suggest an association with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
