<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood samples from 104 patients with leukemic B-cell disorders and 20 healthy donors were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Directly phycoerythrin-conjugated CD19, CD20, CD22, CD23, CD79b, and CD5 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and QuantiBRITE pre-calibrated beads were used to calculate the number of antigen molecules per cell, expressed as antibody binding capacity (ABC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo> (CLL) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> MoAbs tested, with the exception of CD23 and CD5, showed lower ABC levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In prolymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (PL), CD5 and CD23 antigens were constantly absent while lower CD19 and CD22 ABC levels were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (HCL) displayed very high levels of CD20 and CD22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of interest, splenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with villous lymphocytes (SLVL) could be discriminated from HCL for higher CD79b and lower CD19 ABC values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, higher CD20 levels were detected in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL), whereas higher CD79b and CD5 levels characterized mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven out of 61 CLL cases were defined as morphologically atypical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When compared with typical forms, lower levels of CD19 and CD23 and higher CD20 and CD22 ABC values were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, we failed to demonstrate quantitative differences between atypical CLL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that quantitative flow cytometry may be a useful additional tool to better identify some types of B-cell CLDs </plain></SENT>
