<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 1984 and 1994, 204 patients with newly diagnosed Stage III or Stage IV follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were randomized to receive either, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">Chlorambucil</z:chebi> (CB): 10 mg daily for 6 weeks, followed by a 2-week interval, with 3 subsequent 2-week treatment periods at the same dose, separated by 2-week intervals, or, CB given concurrently with interferon (IFN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IFN was given at a dose of 3 x 10(6)units thrice weekly, subcutaneously, throughout the 18-week treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Responding patients were subsequently randomized to receive maintenance IFN at the dose and schedule described above, or to expectant management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 161/204 (78%), complete remission being achieved in 24% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither the addition of IFN to the initial treatment, nor the use of maintenance IFN influenced response rate, remission duration or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to determine whether IFN, given in combination with, and then subsequent to, CB would alter the clinical course of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disappointingly, this objective was not achieved, no advantage having been demonstrated for the addition of IFN </plain></SENT>
