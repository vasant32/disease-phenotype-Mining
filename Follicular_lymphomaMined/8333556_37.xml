<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the morphologic, immunologic, and clinical features of 31 cases of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involving the breast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Primary breast <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> occurred in nine women with a median age of 69 years (range, 51-87 years); median follow-up was 31 months (range, 9-67 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight cases were low grade, one was high grade, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> expressed B-lineage antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four cases had features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT); three were free of disease after excision alone at 10, 12, and 48 months, whereas the fourth relapsed with transition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and died at 25 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients had follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, three of which relapsed, causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from active disease at a median of 55 months (range, 25-67 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One case of small noncleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> relapsed, causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 31 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> secondarily involved the breast in 22 patients (21 women, one man) with a median age of 60 years (range, 39-83 years) at breast relapse; these patients were followed for a median of 88 months (range, 2-271 months) from primary diagnosis and 4 months (range, 0-116 months) from breast relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients had prior documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (10 nodal or splenic, nine extranodal), and breast involvement most commonly occurred as part of widespread, predominantly nodal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients had breast involvement by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that were generalized at diagnosis or staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirteen cases were low grade (nine follicular), seven intermediate grade, and one high grade; 19 of 20 cases expressed B-lineage antigens, and one expressed T-lineage antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four cases had features of MALT-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; in these patients, isolated breast relapses were interspersed with other extranodal relapses, with interim resolution of disease after local or systemic therapy; two were free of disease and two were alive with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e> on treatment at median follow-up of 60 months (range, 9-91 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 15 of 18 nonMALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849867" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">widespread disease</z:e> at breast relapse (median, 29 months; range, 0-259 months); 16 of 18 received systemic therapy, 10 died with active disease, and five of eight had disseminated active disease at last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Primary breast <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were commonly low grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had clinical behavior similar to nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Primary MALT-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were a distinct subset with a potential for disease-free survival after local therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Secondary breast <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and more commonly higher grade, although follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was the most common subtype.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
