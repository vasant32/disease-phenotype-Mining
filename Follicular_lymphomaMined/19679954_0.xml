<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To study the characteristics of BM involvement in NHL with respect to incidence, histologic pattern and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of infiltration and its discordance with the histology of primary anatomic site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Forty-nine cases of NHL in which BM biopsy was performed for staging were included in this study, the primary site being classified according to the WHO classification for NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study of 49 cases was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bilateral BM biopsy was obtained from the posterior superior iliac spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The biopsies were fixed in 10% buffered formalin solution and decalcified using 10% formal - <z:chebi fb="3" ids="30751">formic acid</z:chebi> for 4 - 6 h followed by routine processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The serial sections were stained by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin and reticulin stains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BM biopsy showed involvement by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 27 cases (55.10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unilateral positivity was found in four cases (14.81% cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of marrow involvement by NHL was 55.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of involvement was higher in T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> when compared with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and predominant pattern of involvement was mixed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had the lowest incidence in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A discordant histology between BM and primary anatomic site was found in 29.63% (8/27) of the cases, where it was seen more in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Critical examination of BM biopsies can increase the diagnostic accuracy, thereby contributing to the prognosis and appropriate treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
