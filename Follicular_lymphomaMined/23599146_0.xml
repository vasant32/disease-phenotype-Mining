<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is relatively rare in patients younger than 40 years, and the clinicopathologic characteristics and biological behavior in this age group are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, samples from a cohort of 200 patients between 19 and 40 years were evaluated retrospectively with respect to clinical, histologic, and genetic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These were then correlated with clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age at presentation was 35 years with a slight female prepoderance (56%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most of the cases are presented with nodal disease (90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concomitant follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were observed in 7 (4%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistologic studies showed the expression of CD10 (91%), BCL6 (97%), BCL2 (95%), MUM1/IRF4 (12%), MDM2 (17%), and CD23 (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BCL2 rearrangement was present in 74%, and BCL6 in 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The estimated overall survival of patients was 13 years (mean) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, elevated <z:chebi fb="8" ids="17716">lactose</z:chebi> dehydrogenase, bone marrow involvement, and high-risk follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> international prognostic index correlated with adverse overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings revealed that follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in young adults demonstrate similarities with that of older adults, including the frequency of presentation at various anatomic sites, grade, and adverse prognostic factors.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 19 April 2013; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2013.50 </plain></SENT>
