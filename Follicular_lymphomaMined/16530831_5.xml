<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Accurate monitoring of the t(14;18) translocation is regarded as highly desirable in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) as absence of bcl-2/IgH positive cells has been correlated with a reduced risk of recurrence and, more recently, pre-treatment t(14;18) load with response to rituximab (R; Blood 2004;103:4416-23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the arrival of R clinical and molecular remission rates for various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> entities improved significantly, creating the need to carefully review and reassess the role of PCR negativity for clinical outcome, specifically when considering the prolonged presence of the drug as compared to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the rate of molecular clearance achieved by the addition of different doses of R 16 newly diagnosed, t(14;18) positive patients with FL (Ann Arbor stages III/IV) were investigated before, during and after primary chemotherapy with six cycles of CHOP combined with varying (1, 3 or 6) cycle numbers of R (varR1-, varR3- or varR6-CHOP, respectively) regarding molecular remission status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this purpose classic nested PCR as well as a newly established RQ-PCR employing juxtaposed hybridisation probes were employed to assess molecular remission prior, during and post therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, administering just a single cycle of R (varR1-CHOP) in combination with a standard regimen of CHOP resulted in rapid and effective clearance of t(14;18) carrying cells from the peripheral blood of 4/5 patients in this treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>6/8 (6/8) varR1-/varR3-CHOP patients were fully cleared and 8/8 (7/8) var6-CHOP patients as assessed by RQ- (nested) PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This indicates the high clearance capacity of this combination therapy approach even when adding a very low cycle number of R (1 and 3, respectively) to CHOP in primary therapy of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, the relationship established between molecular clearance and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e>/risk of recurrence may have to be redefined in the times of R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Upcoming large prospective trials will have to elucidate to what degree the clearance of peripheral blood from t(14;18) positive cells can still be regarded as informative regarding absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e>, remission status and/or risk of recurrence </plain></SENT>
