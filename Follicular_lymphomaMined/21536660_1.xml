<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-five patients were treated using a sequential treatment schedule of four induction cycles of FMR chemoimmunotherapy, and a subsequent consolidating single administration of (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan ((90)Y-IT), 8-14 weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were eligible for radioimmunotherapy if at least in partial response (PR) after induction, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet and granulocyte counts and a bone marrow infiltration â‰¤ 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary study end points were response rate and hematologic toxic effects; secondary end points were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the 55 patients received four induction cycles with an overall response rate of 96% (38 complete responses [CR] and 15 PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one patients (38 in CR and 13 in PR) received (90)Y-IT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By the end of the treatment, 49/55 patients achieved a CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 21 months, the estimated 3-year PFS was 81% and the 3-year OS 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study has established feasibility, tolerability, and efficacy of a regimen composed by short FMR induction with (90)Y-IT consolidation in untreated intermediate/high-risk follicular NHL patients </plain></SENT>
