<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Overexpression of cyclin D1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein as a result of the chromosomal translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) is a highly specific molecular marker of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but cyclin D1 dysregulation can also be found in other B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to develop a precise and reliable tool for quantitation of cyclin D1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> suitable for archival clinical specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay was used to quantitate cyclin D1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> copy numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using 2000 microdissected cells as template, 104 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lymph node, spleen, and decalcified bone marrow biopsies from a panel of 95 cases of B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (B-NHLs) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, cyclin D1 protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Strong cyclin D1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> overexpression was detected in mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (23 of 23), hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (5 of 19), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myelomas</z:hpo> (7 of 23) with particularly high levels in 2 of the latter cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intermediate transcript levels were found in 5 of 23 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myelomas</z:hpo> and 7 of 19 hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo> (10 of 10), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (9 of 9), mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (5 of 5) and reactive lymphoid tissues with the exception of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> spleen had no or very low cyclin D1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparison with real-time RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry showed a lower level of sensitivity, more variability, and did not allow accurate quantitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Real-time RT-PCR for cyclin D1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is an excellent tool for the differential diagnosis of B-NHLs and, in combination with microdissection, a powerful approach for retrospective trials using archival clinical specimens as tissue source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, real-time RT-PCR may help to identify subgroups of B-NHLs according to cyclin D1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> copy numbers and to investigate the possible influence of different chromosomal breakpoints on cyclin D1 expression </plain></SENT>
