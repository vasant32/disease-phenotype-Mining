<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FDG-PET is used also for the assessment of therapeutic response as well as work-up of recurrence after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to the characteristics of FDG-PET as an imaging tool, FDG-PET is supposed to be superior to the conventional imaging such as CT for the accurate assessment of the treatment response in patients with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> usually undergoes chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy as a treatment of stage III and IV patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent advancement in the therapy of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> enables optional treatment strategies such as radioimmunotherapy with 90Y-labeled anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody or oral fludalabine for indolent non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation for aggressive non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to determine the clinical value of FDG-PET for the early assessment of therapeutic response of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The subject consists of 10 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 9 diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and others </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complete remission on the PET (CR(PET)) was defined as the FDG uptake lower than the background and compared with the final response assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CR(PET) was acquired in 4 of 5 patients at 1-2 courses, 6 of 7 at 3-4 courses, 4 of 7 at 5-6 courses, and 3 of 7 at 7-8 courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the group of 7-8 courses, final response assessment revealed 2 patients excess of CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In patients who underwent multiple PET studies during the treatment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 patients showed CR(PET) in its first assessment, and maintained CR thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The present study revealed that most of the patients achieved CR(PET) up to 4 courses of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The cases with remaining FDG uptake at this time were likely to be resistant to the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The early assessment of therapeutic response may be accurately assessed by FDG-PET as early as 2 or 4 courses of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Residual uptake of FDG in the lesion would be considered to be subject to the new therapeutic strategy </plain></SENT>
