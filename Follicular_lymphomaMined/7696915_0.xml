<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 61 cases <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were studied with specific markers in a CAS-200 Image Analyser </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry (FCM) was also done and correlated with proliferative-values and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A minor aggressive course of CB-CC and ML was demonstrated, with ML being the most benign form (lower proliferation rate and longest survival) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ploidy did not correlate with histological subtypes, survival or response to therapy </plain></SENT>
