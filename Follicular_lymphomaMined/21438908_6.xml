<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To establish the utility of flow cytometry (FCM) for screening and diagnosis of B cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B-NHL) from lymphoid tissue samples obtained by fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> (FNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared prospectively FCM versus cytology/histology analysis of FNA samples for the diagnostic screening and further World Health Organization (WHO) subclassification of B-NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FCM and cytology showed a high degree of agreement (93%); however, diagnosis of reactive processes (RP), B-NHL and T-NHL by FCM showed higher sensitivity than cytology (92-100% versus 64-94%, respectively), without false positive NHL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The antibody combination used did not allow a positive diagnosis of Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> as distinct from a RP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A high concordance rate was found between FCM and histopathology (74%) in subtyping B-NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this regard, mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed the highest degree of agreement (100% concordant rates) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In turn, FCM showed higher sensitivity/specificity in classifying follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) and large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, while the opposite occurred for marginal-zone and lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FCM enhances the diagnostic ability of FNA cytology, playing a crucial role in a rapid and accurate differential diagnosis between RP, B-NHL and T-NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, immunophenotyping of FNA samples contributes to a more precise subclassification of B-NHL when combined with histopathology and genetic/molecular data </plain></SENT>
