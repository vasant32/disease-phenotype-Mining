<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although this translocation was predominantly associated with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), recent studies have shown that it can also be found in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL), often associated with a large cell component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the relationship that might exist between this translocation and the phenotype of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, we studied 34 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with a t(3;14)(q27;q32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty cases were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, 14 FL and most cases, regardless of histology, were negative for the expression of CD10 (26/32, 81%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified the IGH switch region involved in the translocation for 32 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> most breakpoints involve the switch mu (17/19; 89%), whereas in FL most involve a switch gamma (9/13; 70%) (P=0.0016, Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This correlation between the histology and the structure of the translocated allele suggests that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with Smu and Sgamma translocations may originate from different cells, or that the substituted regulatory regions that come to deregulate BCL6 may affect the presentation of the disease </plain></SENT>
