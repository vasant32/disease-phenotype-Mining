<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The variable region genes used to encode the immunoglobulin expressed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells of a patient with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> have been identified and sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initially, a lymph node biopsy was analysed and revealed usage of VH and V kappa genes which had numerous substitutions as compared with the closest germ line genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pattern of mutations in VH was consistent with a role for positive selection by antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was evidence in both VH and V kappa sequences for clonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 5 years, which included treatment with chemotherapy, the patient relapsed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells present in the blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the V-genes used by the emerging <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> revealed a single homogeneous sequence for both VH and VL, which, in each case, matched closely one of the sequences in the original lymph node biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that selection, possibly mediated by antigen, can operate on a cell destined to give rise to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and that intraclonal variation can occur after the neoplastic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in this case, late relapse in the blood is dominated by a single clone </plain></SENT>
