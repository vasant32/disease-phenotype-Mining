<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Nonlymphoma-associated bcl-2/IgH rearrangements (NLABRs) are frequently amplified by PCR in blood of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-free subjects (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LFS</z:e>), but the temporal kinetics and phenotypic nature of NLABR-positive cells are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To address these issues we prospectively monitored a panel of NLABR-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LFS</z:e> have been studied by nested PCR, real-time PCR, and DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell selection studies were also performed to define the nature of NLABR-bearing clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 125 donors, 16 (12.8%) were found to be bcl-2/IgH positive and were monitored at least every 6 months for a median time of 22 months (range 6-50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In half of the subjects the same NLABR detected initially was again reamplified at follow-up thrice or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 5, the same NLABR was constantly amplified in every follow-up sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 22 months (range 9-50), no stable disappearance of a recurrent clone has been so far recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Real-time PCR indicated that persistent NLABR-positive clones are stable over time in the same subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cell separation studies indicate that NLABRs belong to CD19+, CD5-, CD23-, CD10+/- cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that NLABR-positive clones are persistent populations phenotypically related to follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suggests the existence of a FL-related clonal expansion of undetermined significance, which might be either a premalignant or a nonmalignant counterpart of FL </plain></SENT>
