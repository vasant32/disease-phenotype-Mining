<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The transformation is accompanied by alteration in morphologic features and clinical behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, we report a case of FL occurring in a 59-year-old woman with the development of a precursor B-cell lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBC</z:e>-LBL) during a 6-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had identical bcl-2 and immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene breakpoints as assessed by polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing, indicating that the 2 tumors originated from a common precursor B-cell clone or the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBC</z:e>-LBL arose from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> of its preceding FL and "dedifferentiated" into a lymphoblastic stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies revealed that both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> displayed typical phenotypic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A c-myc gene translocation was observed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBC</z:e>-LBL but not the FL by fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The c-myc translocation is also reported in similar cases in the literature and likely is crucial in the pathogenesis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBC</z:e>-LBL </plain></SENT>
