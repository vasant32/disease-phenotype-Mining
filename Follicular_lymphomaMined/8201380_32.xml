<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess myeloablative therapy with autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) in younger patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the hope of prolonging remission duration and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since June 1985, 64 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> have received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) 60 mg/kg x 2 and total-body irradiation (TBI) 2 Gy x 6 supported by ABMT as consolidation of second or subsequent remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The marrow mononuclear cell (MNC) fraction was treated in vitro with three cycles of the monoclonal antibody (MAb) anti-CD20 and baby rabbit complement before cryopreservation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the time of treatment, 34 patients were in complete remission (CR), and 30 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median time to engraftment was 28 days (range, 15 to 46) for both a neutrophil count greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/L and a platelet count greater than 20 x 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Engraftment did not occur in one patient who died at 12 weeks, and three patients (excluded from the range) have had delayed recovery (&gt; 6 months) of RBCs and platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty two patients are alive; three died as a consequence of the transplant procedure, two died in remission from other causes, and seven died of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between survival and the total number of episodes of treatment required during the course of the illness (&lt; or = to three v &gt; three, P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up duration of 3 1/2 years, 35 patients continue in remission between 1 and 8 years, and 24 have developed recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, five with evidence of transformation to high-grade histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Freedom from recurrence did not correlate with the time from diagnosis, the number of previous treatments, the presence or absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> at the time of treatment, or during which specific remission the treatment was given (second v &gt; second) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, comparison with an age-matched, remission-matched, historical control group shows a significant advantage in favor of treatment with CY plus TBI plus ABMT (P = .001); currently, there is no difference in survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results are encouraging, although preliminary; it remains to be established whether this treatment prolongs survival </plain></SENT>
