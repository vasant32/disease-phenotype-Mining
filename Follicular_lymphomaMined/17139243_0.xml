<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The introduction of targeted therapy in combination with chemotherapy has greatly advanced the treatment of patients with indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most commonly studied in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the monoclonal antibody rituximab has not only improved the response rate and progression-free survival for both treatment-naive and relapsed/refractory patients, it is also beginning to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These benefits are challenging many of the standard treatment approaches in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and offer hope that treatment of the disease may soon advance from being palliative to curative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ongoing research seeks to determine how best to use targeted agents in the setting of indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, either concurrently with chemotherapy or sequentially following the administration of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Various studies aim to define the utility of rituximab as a long-term maintenance treatment in several follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> settings, as well as its benefit in autologous stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to these immunotherapy studies, the use of radioimmunotherapy is also being explored for its efficacy as a frontline and consolidation treatment approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As additional molecular and targeted therapeutics advance through clinical trials, future treatment strategies for indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> will likely involve the addition of these newer therapeutics to immunochemotherapy based on the individual risk profile of a patient </plain></SENT>
