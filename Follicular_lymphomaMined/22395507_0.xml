<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Very often, the first doctor who examines a patient with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is an ENT specialist, because non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is five times more frequent than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e> in the head and neck region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 25% of extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> occurs in the head and neck and extranodal presentation is twice as frequent as nodal presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper present a study of the patients from ENT, Head &amp; Neck Surgery Clinic of Coltea Clinical Hospital, Bucharest, Romania, diagnosed with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We developed a specific scheme for collecting data about patients, together with pathology details, immunology and cytogenetic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We tried to establish a relation between immunologic and cytogenetic markers and the clinical evolution of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For this study, we analyzed data regarding CD10, CD5, CD20, Bcl-2, Bcl-6, Ki67 expression obtained from 58 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An attempt was made to correlate the presence of certain immunohistochemical and cytogenetic markers with the evolution and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> of the disease, and we can say that Bcl-2 is positive in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> subtypes, being associated relatively frequently with CD5 expression, and is a marker of poor prognosis, while Bcl-6 is positive especially in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> forms associated with the predominance of small cells and is a marker of favorable prognosis </plain></SENT>
