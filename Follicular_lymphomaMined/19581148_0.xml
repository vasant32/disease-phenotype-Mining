<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Spinal malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> among these survivors is rare in established studies from Japan or the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report an 81-year-old woman, who experienced the atomic bomb explosion in Nagasaki when she was 19 years old, who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002895'>papillary thyroid carcinoma</z:hpo> when she was 70 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> over the right elbow region and vertebral malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were found when she turned 81 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone scan did not show any increased uptake of isotope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, thoracolumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple infiltrative soft tissue masses involving vertebral bodies at the T10-11 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography-guided biopsy further showed lymphocyte infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fortunately, the neurological deficit was improved after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in atomic bomb survivors should be more careful and aggressive, even when their bone scan results show negative findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, the authors suggest that atomic bomb survivors should be followed-up carefully throughout their entire life </plain></SENT>
