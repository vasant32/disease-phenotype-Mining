<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the REAL classification system, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) were subdivided into three grades depending on the number of blasts (6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we were interested in defining biological parameters possibly being important in the delineation of subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between 1990 and 1998, biological and cytogenetic investigations were performed on 91 FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clonal aberrations were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were subclassified according to the blast content and the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the centrocytes into 29 FL 1, 33 FL 2, 15 FL 3, and 14 FL 3 with a diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> component (FL 3 + DLBL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were characterised by classical cytogenetics, for their mitotic (MI) and proliferative (PI) indices, and CD10, bcl-2, and p53-expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to FL 1 and FL 2, which showed a common genetic background with t(14;18), and only differed by their blast content and MI/PI, FL 3 (with or without associated DLBL) turned out to be an inhomogeneous group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>11 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (with &gt; 150 blasts/10HPF) still showed maturation to centrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They were positive for CD10 and harboured the t(14;18) in 73% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These cases correspond to a "high grade" variant of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e>-centrocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> according to the Kiel classification (FL 3a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 18 cases with a follicular or follicular and diffuse growth pattern, the infiltrate consisted of centroblasts exclusively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were CD10+ in only 50% and were t(14;18)+ in only 22% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Secretory differentiation (clg+) was found in 44% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>They were--with respect to primary and secondary chromosome aberrations--more comparable to a follicular variant of DLBL and hence, correspond to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular and diffuse according to the Kiel classification (FL 3b) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>By histomorphological, biological and cytogenetic investigations, therefore, FL 3 can be delineated into two different biological subgroups with obviously different transformation pathways </plain></SENT>
