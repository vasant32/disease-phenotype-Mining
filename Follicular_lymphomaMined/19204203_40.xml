<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Optimal therapy of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is not defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed a large prospective cohort study to identify current demographics and patterns of care of FL in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The National LymphoCare Study is a multicenter, longitudinal, observational study designed to collect information on treatment regimens and outcomes for patients with newly diagnosed FL in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were enrolled between 2004 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is no study-specific prescribed treatment regimen or intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two thousand seven hundred twenty-eight subjects were enrolled at 265 sites, including the 80% of patients enrolled from nonacademic sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI), three distinct groups independent of histologic grade could be defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Initial therapeutic strategy was: observation, 17.7%; rituximab monotherapy, 13.9%; clinical trial 6.1%; radiation therapy, 5.6%; chemotherapy only, 3.2%; chemotherapy plus rituximab, 51.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy plus rituximab regimens were: rituximab plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, 55.0%; rituximab plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, 23.1%; rituximab plus fludarabine based, 15.5%; other, 6.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The choice to initiate therapy rather than observe was associated with age, FLIPI, stage, and grade (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in treatment (P &lt; .01) across regions of the United States were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Contrary to practice guidelines, treatment of stage I FL frequently omits radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Widely disparate therapeutic approaches are utilized for FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Initial therapy is deferred in a small subset of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There is no single standard of care for the treatment of de novo FL, although antibody use is ubiquitous when therapy is initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These disparate approaches to the initial care of patients with FL render a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of patients at relapse </plain></SENT>
