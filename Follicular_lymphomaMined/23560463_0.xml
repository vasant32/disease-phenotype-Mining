<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppressive states due to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation have been regarded as causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sometimes spontaneous regression occurs after withdrawal of MTX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to identify factors predictive of relapse and survival in patients with RA-LPD, and spontaneous regression in patients with RA-LPD treated with MTX (MTX-LPD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated the clinicopathological features, clinical characteristics, and treatment outcomes in 102 cases of RA-LPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> and clonality of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGH) were analysed by in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 102 cases included patients with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>; n=53), Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=9), polymorphic B-cell LPD (n=20), reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002840'>lymphadenitis</z:hpo> (n=11), peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e>; n=4), composite <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=2), and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EBV was detected in 60% (56/93) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous regression occurred in 59% (28/47) of patients in whom MTX was withdrawn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regression was associated with EBV-positivity (p=0.007) and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (p=0.006), but not with MTX amount and other clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal bands of IGH were observed in 31 of 74 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, poor disease-free survival (p=0.05) was associated with clonality of IGH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, factors predictive of shorter survival were age (&gt;70 years) and histological type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Histology, EBV positivity, and monoclonality of IGH are useful for predicting clinical outcomes in patients with RA-LPD </plain></SENT>
