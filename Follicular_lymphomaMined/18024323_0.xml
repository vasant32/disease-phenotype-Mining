<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the distribution of lymphoid cells in the bone marrow of 10 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) cases in complete response after immunochemotherapy but with nodular lymphoid infiltrates mimicking persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> nodules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis showed that most of these cells displayed a T-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> with important proportions of regulatory T cells (CD3+/CD4+/FOXP3+) and mast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These populations were also present before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whereas no CD20+ cells were observed, immature B cells (CD79a+/terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase+/CD20-) were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cells were scarce before immunochemotherapy, suggesting that immunochemotherapy enabled their expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction failed to detect residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in 5 cases with the t(14;18) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study describes 2 important features in bone marrow in FL following immunochemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is probable that the accumulation of regulatory T cells has some role in the control of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expansion of nonmalignant B cells reflects the regeneration of B-cell lineage following immunochemotherapy </plain></SENT>
