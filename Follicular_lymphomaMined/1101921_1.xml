<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In adults the histological pattern at initial biopsy was interpreted as nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 33% and as diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 67% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffuse histiocytic was the most frequently observed histological subtype in the present series (54%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffuse undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was noted in 2/6 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Waldeyer's ring involvement was noted in 27% of adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Systemic symptoms were present in 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgery detected occult lesions in 27% of patients (para-aortic nodes 3%, spleen 12%, liver 12%, coeliac nodes 15%, splenic hilar nodes 26%, mesenteric nodes 15%, gastrointestinal tract 1%, bone marrow 12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The chance of detecting splenic and hepatic involvement was definitely higher in patients with nodal disease above and below the diaphragm in comparison with those with either supra-diaphragmatic or infra-diaphragmatic <z:mp ids='MP_0000702'>adenopathy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lymphography yielded a 96% accuracy proving once more to be a sufficiently reliable diagnostic method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Staging laparotomy is a useful procedure in non-Hodgkin's lymphomata in order to gain information on the natural history and to plan treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It remains to be determined whether findings observed through surgical staging will lead to improved treatment and survival </plain></SENT>
