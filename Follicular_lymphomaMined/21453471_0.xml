<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Diagnostic accuracy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, is essential for patient management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several ancillary tests including immunophenotyping, and sometimes cytogenetics and PCR are required to aid histological diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this proof of principle study, gene expression microarray was evaluated as a single platform test in the differential diagnosis of common <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes and reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> (RL) in lymph node biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 116 lymph node biopsies diagnosed as RL, classical Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (cHL), diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) were assayed by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three supervised classification strategies (global multi-class, local binary-class and global binary-class classifications) using diagonal linear discriminant analysis was performed on training sets of array data and the classification error rates calculated by leave one out cross-validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The independent error rate was then evaluated by testing the identified gene classifiers on an independent (test) set of array data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The binary classifications provided prediction accuracies, between a subtype of interest and the remaining samples, of 88.5%, 82.8%, 82.8% and 80.0% for FL, cHL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, and RL respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Identified gene classifiers include LIM domain only-2 (LMO2), Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 22 (CCL22) and Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-3 (CDK3) specifically for FL, cHL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> subtypes respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the ability of gene expression profiling to distinguish <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from reactive conditions and classify the major subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in a diagnostic setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A cost-effective single platform "mini-chip" assay could, in principle, be developed to aid the quick diagnosis of lymph node biopsies with the potential to incorporate other pathological entities into such an assay </plain></SENT>
