<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The CD20 antigen is expressed on more than 90% of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is appealing for targeted therapy, because it does not shed or modulate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A chimeric monoclonal antibody more effectively mediates host effector functions and is itself less immunogenic than are murine antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a multiinstitutional trial of the chimeric anti-CD20 antibody, IDEC-C2B8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with relapsed low grade or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> received an outpatient treatment course of IDEC-C2B8 375 mg/m2 intravenously weekly for four doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 31 centers, 166 patients were entered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of this intent-to-treat group, 48% responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up duration of 11.8 months, the projected median time to progression for responders is 13.0 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum antibody levels were sustained longer after the fourth infusion than after the first, and were higher in responders and in patients with lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of adverse events occurred during the first infusion and were grade 1 or 2; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and chills were the most common events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only 12% of patients had grade 3 and 3% grade 4 toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A human antichimeric antibody was detected in only one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The response rate of 48% with IDEC-C2B8 is comparable to results with single-agent cytotoxic chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Attention needs to be paid to the rate of antibody infusion, with titration according to toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of this agent is warranted, including its use in conjunction with standard chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
