<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is a common <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although its course is often indolent, a substantial proportion of patients have a poor prognosis, often due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> or transformation to a more aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently available clinical prognostic scores, such as the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> international prognostic index, are not able to optimally predict transformation or poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression profiling was done on primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> biopsy samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using a statistically conservative approach, predictive interaction analysis, we have identified pairs of interacting genes that predict poor outcome, measured as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 5 years of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The best gene pair performs &gt;1,000-fold better than any single gene or the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> international prognostic index in our data set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Many gene pairs achieve outcome prediction accuracies exceeding 85% in extensive cross-validation and noise sensitivity computational analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Many genes repeatedly appear in top-ranking pairs, suggesting that they reproducibly provide predictive capability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The evidence reported here may provide the basis for an expression-based, multi-gene test for predicting poor follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> outcomes </plain></SENT>
