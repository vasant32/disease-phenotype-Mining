<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ixabepilone (BMS-247550, epothilone B analog), a potent inhibitor of tubulin disassembly, has promising preclinical and early-phase clinical activity in drug-resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This multicenter phase 2 clinical trial tested the activity and safety of ixabepilone in relapsed/refractory aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients with either chemosensitive (at least a partial response [PR] to most recent chemotherapy) or chemoresistant (less than PR to most recent chemotherapy) disease at 20 mg/m(2) given intravenously weekly on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-one enrolled patients with a median age of 66 years received at least 1 dose of ixabepilone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 25; 49%), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 16; 31%), and transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 5; 10%) were the most frequent histologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were heavily pretreated, with more than one-quarter having received 4 or more prior therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 27% (14 of 51 patients) with 12% (6 patients) experiencing complete responses and 16% (8 patients) with PRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> responses were in patients with chemosensitive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median time to response was 2 cycles with a median duration of response of 9.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ixabepilone was well-tolerated, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>peripheral sensory neuropathy</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> as the major toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ixabepilone has modest single-agent activity in patients with recurrent chemosensitive aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
