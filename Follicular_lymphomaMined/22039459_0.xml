<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed to characterize 81 cases of myeloid and lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> with cytogenetic 1p36 alterations not affecting the PRDM16 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In total, three subgroups were identified: balanced translocations (N��= 27) and telomeric rearrangements (N = 15), both mainly observed in myeloid disorders; and unbalanced non-telomeric rearrangements (N = 39), mainly observed in lymphoid proliferations and frequently associated with a highly complex karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 1p36 rearrangement was isolated in 12 cases, mainly myeloid disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The breakpoints on 1p36 were more widely distributed than previously reported, but with identifiable rare breakpoint cluster regions, such as the TP73 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also found novel partner loci on 1p36 for the known multi-partner genes HMGA2 and RUNX1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We precised the common terminal 1p36 deletion, which has been suggested to have an adverse prognosis, in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> [follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with t(14;18)(q32;q21) as well as follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> without t(14;18)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intrachromosomal telomeric repetitive sequences were detected in at least half the cases of telomeric rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is unclear how the latter rearrangements occurred and whether they represent oncogenic events or result from <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
