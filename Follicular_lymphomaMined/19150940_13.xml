<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To determine the efficacy and side-effects of (90)Y ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) as front-line treatment in patients with early-stage extranodal indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the ocular adnexa (orbit, conjunctiva, or eyelid) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From August 2004 to November 2007, 12 patients with stages I-E extranodal indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the ocular adnexa were enrolled in a prospective trial of rituximab followed by (90)Y ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin therapeutic regimen) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each patient, clinical examinations and imaging studies were used to document response to therapy using the The International Working Group response criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had (111)In ibritumomab tixuetan imaging to confirm expected biodistribution before (90)Y-Zevalin therapy; in addition, three patients had an optional single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography-computed tomography scan to estimate the absorbed radiation dose to the orbital and ocular tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study included seven women and five men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median age was 60 years (range 22-79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of conjunctiva or orbit; three patients had grades 1-2 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of orbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient who had been deemed stage I-E initially was found to have another lesion in her deltoid muscle on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography 2 weeks after enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>She was kept on trial although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017925" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">her disease</z:e> was reclassified as stage IV due to this single additional (biopsy-proven) site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had a complete response and two partial response (PR) within 3 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient had a recurrence in the upper eyelid 6 months after an initial PR; he then received 30 Gy of external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>His disease later progressed again in the orbit and he is currently being considered for other treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A second patient who attained a PR has remained stable with no progression 12 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up time of 20 months (range 6-44 months), there were no cases of distant (extraorbital) relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 12 patients experienced grade I or II transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> during the first 3 months after enrollment in the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were no episodes of grade III or IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The estimated absorbed radiation dose to the orbital soft tissues was &lt;3 Gy, 10 times lower than that with EBRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Rituximab followed by (90)Y ibritumomab tiuxetan is an effective and safe front-line treatment for early-stage extranodal indolent B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the ocular adnexa </plain></SENT>
