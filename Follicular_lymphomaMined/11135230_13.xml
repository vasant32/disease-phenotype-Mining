<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is no consistent definition at what age patients with non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) are considered "elderly." This might hamper well balanced decisions with respect to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From a population-based NHL registry the age groups younger than 60 years, 60-64 years, 65-69 years, 70-74 years, and 75 years and older were analyzed in relation to the revised European-American <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> classification and to the age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (IPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prognostic value of the variables from the age-adjusted IPI was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relative survival probabilities were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLBL) increased with advancing age, as was the case for small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were less frequently encountered with advancing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With respect to the so-called indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, a decreasing complete remission rate and overall survival rate (5-year) was observed for patients older than 70 years, whereas patients with DLBL fared worse when older than 65 years and 60 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The age-adjusted IPI score was discriminative for prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, even with an IPI score nil, the age group older than 75 years fared significantly worse (P &lt; 0.009), but less so with the relative survival model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relative survival at 5 years was 60%, 53%, 48%, 35%, and 32% for the 5 respective age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> become elderly when they are older than 70 years, but when aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is concerned this occurs when patients are older than 65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For patients with an IPI score nil, age older than 75 years is the dominant prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The negative influence of concomitant disease on overall survival, although continuously increasing in older age groups, seems to diminish for patients older than 75 years when compared with the general Dutch population </plain></SENT>
