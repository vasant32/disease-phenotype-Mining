<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To describe the value of monoclonal antibodies in the differential diagnosis of orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 200 sequential cases of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosed at St Bartholomew's Hospital as part of the ocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> service at Moorfields Eye Hospital and the Institute of Ophthalmology have been examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cases were acquired between January 1998 and June 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each case had detailed immunophenotypic analysis using a panel of monoclonal antibodies and was classified using the WHO classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cases are discussed in relation to earlier studies of orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> reported by our group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphomas</z:hpo> fell into three main categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was the largest group with 151 cases, arising within the orbital soft tissue, conjunctiva and lacrimal gland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cases arising in the conjunctiva and lacrimal gland showed a higher female predominance than those arising within the deeper soft tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A small number of cases were associated with organ specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0339143" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyroid eye disease</z:e> complicating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Graves' disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> formed the next two groups, occurring with equal frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Many of the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had evidence of disseminated disease on completion of staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A miscellaneous group of T-cell and B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> formed a minority of cases during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is the most frequent type of primary orbital and orbital adnexal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Its major differential diagnosis is with orbital <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0008880'>dacryoadenitis</z:mp>, and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000509'>conjunctivitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Systemic types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> may present within the orbit or involve the orbit secondarily </plain></SENT>
