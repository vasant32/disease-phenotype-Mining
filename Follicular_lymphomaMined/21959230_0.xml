<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: New therapeutic options have led to substantial increases in survival expectations of patients with non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast to many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, survival in older patients has improved in NHL at a rate similar to that in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the past, the impact of innovations on long-term survival of NHL patients on the population level has been disclosed only with substantial delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We employ a novel model-based projection method to estimate survival expectations of NHL patients age 60+ diagnosed in 2008-2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preliminary empirical evaluation of the method using historical data indicates excellent performance in projection of age specific and overall 5- and 10-year relative survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall 5- and 10-year survival projections for 2008-2012 were 67.5% and 56.9%, respectively, 8.2 percentage units (% units) and 15.2% units, respectively, higher than the most recent survival estimates available from traditional cohort analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Projected survival decreased with age, ranging from 79.1% for patients age 60-64 to 54.3% for patients age 80+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Projected survival estimates for diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were 59% and 84.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival estimates by model-based projection were substantially higher than available cohort estimates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups including 80+, each specific <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> examined, nodal and extranodal disease, and both genders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients over 60 diagnosed with NHL in 2008-2012 have much higher long-term survival expectations than suggested by previously available survival statistics </plain></SENT>
