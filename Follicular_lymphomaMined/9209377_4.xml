<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report here a large series of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> with regard to rearrangement of the BCL6 gene on chromosome band 3q27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis using probes from the major translocation cluster (MTC) region of the BCL6 revealed rearrangement in 32 of a total of 222 patients with various subtypes of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), rearrangements of the BCL6 gene were not closely associated with a specific histopathologic subtype but distributed in subcategories in the Working Formulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A comparative study between NHL associated either with BCL2 or BCL6 rearrangement showed that advanced disease and bone marrow involvement were more frequent in BCL2(+) NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, extranodal involvement was more frequently observed in the BCL6(+) NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The survival curve of BCL6(+) NHL was characterized by a rapid decline followed by a plateau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the total of 32 BCL6(+) patients, 6 carried both BCL2 and BCL6 rearrangements, and showed clinicopathological properties of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that BCL6 rearrangement is primarily associated with large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and that BCL2(-)BCL6(+) NHL could potentially be curable with modern combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
