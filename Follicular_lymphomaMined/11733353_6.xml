<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Assessment of clonality either by demonstrating light chain restriction or showing monoclonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangement is a valuable and indispensable adjunct to diagnosis in hematopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study of light chain restriction by immunohistochemistry on archival material is hampered by a very low sensitivity especially regarding low grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of B cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA rearrangement studies of the immunoglobulin locus do improve sensitivity markedly but for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of follicle center origin they are prone to false negative results due to hypermutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore we developed a new clonality assay based on the quantification of immunoglobulin light chain transcripts using real-time polymerase chain reaction technology, which is also suitable for the analysis of archival bone marrow trephines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We tested the reproducibility and sensitivity of this approach by comparatively analyzing a series of bone marrow trephines with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (n = 26), reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> (n = 37), and focal infiltration by low grade B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We could raise the detection rate of clonality from an average of 17% by immunohistochemistry and 66% as assessed by polymerase chain reaction rearrangement studies to 83% by this new technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite false negative results due to light chain hypermutation in some cases, the detection rate of clonality could be improved even for B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of follicle center origin (follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) thus making this novel approach a valuable additional tool for the hematopathologist </plain></SENT>
