<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA extracted from 20 Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> patients and 62 healthy controls was analyzed for KIR genotyping using a polymerase chain reaction/sequence specific primers technique (PCR/SSP) for the presence of 16 KIR gene and pseudogene loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The AA, AB, and BB genotype frequencies were, respectively, 20%, 60% and 20% with an A:B ratio of 1:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>KIR 2DL4, KIR 3DL2, KIR 3DL3, and KIR 3DP1*003 were presented in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant difference between patients and controls was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: KIR genotyping profile does not seem to be associated with Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results presented in this pilot research represent the first international report about this important clinical entity </plain></SENT>
