<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Regulatory T cells (T(R)) play a critical role in the inhibition of self-reactive immune responses and as such have been implicated in the suppression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-reactive effector T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrate that follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL)-infiltrating CD8+ and CD4+ T cells are hyporesponsive to CD3/CD28 costimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We further identify a population of FL-infiltrating CD4+CD25+GITR+ T(R) that are significantly overrepresented within FL nodes (FLN) compared with that seen in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (nonmalignant, nonlymphoid hyperplastic) or reactive (nonmalignant, lymphoid hyperplastic) nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These T(R) actively suppress both the proliferation of autologous nodal CD8+CD25- and CD4+CD25- T cells, as well as cytokine production (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-2), after CD3/CD28 costimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Removal of these cells in vitro by CD25+ magnetic bead <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> restores both the proliferation and cytokine production of the remaining T cells, demonstrating that FLN T cell hyporesponsiveness is reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to suppressing autologous nodal T cells, these T(R) are also capable of suppressing the proliferation of allogeneic CD8+CD25- and CD4+CD25- T cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymph nodes as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donor PBL, regardless of very robust stimulation of the target cells with plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 Abs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The allogeneic suppression is not reciprocal, as equivalent numbers of CD25+FOXP3+ cells derived from either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymph nodes or PBL are not capable of suppressing allogeneic CD8+CD25- and CD4+CD25- T cells, suggesting that FLN T(R) are more suppressive than those derived from nonmalignant sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lastly, we demonstrate that inhibition of TGF-beta signaling partially restores FLN T cell proliferation suggesting a mechanistic role for TGF-beta in FLN T(R)-mediated suppression </plain></SENT>
