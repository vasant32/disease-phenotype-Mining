<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HT occurred at a median of 2·75 years from initial FL diagnosis and HT rate was 15% at 10 years and 26% at 14 years, with a plateau from that point onward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with bulky or extranodal disease, or those diagnosed before 1990 had a significantly higher risk of HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When initial treatment strategies were taken into account, a reduced HT risk was seen in the patients initially managed with a 'watch and wait' policy, while the risk appeared significantly increased in the small subset of 18 patients initially managed with rituximab plus chemotherapy (P = 0·0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HT was associated with a significantly shorter cause-specific survival (P = 0·0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Predictors of survival after HT were the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index at diagnosis, as well as age and performance status at the time of HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data confirm the adverse clinical outcome of FL after HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In keeping with previous isolated reports, our findings suggest that there is a subgroup of patients in whom HT may not occur </plain></SENT>
