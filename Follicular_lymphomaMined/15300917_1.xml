<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopic examination revealed a rectal submucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (SMT) without any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this patient, it was difficult to distinguish non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) invasion from other disorders of the colon including <z:hpo ids='HP_0100570'>carcinoid tumor</z:hpo> merely based on endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic and immunohistochemical studies on biopsy specimens showed an infiltration of atypical lymphocytes that were positive for CD20 and BCL2 but negative for UCHL-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization on paraffin-embedded tissue sections (T-FISH) identified a translocation of BCL2 with IGH gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was defined as an invasion of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>T-FISH method is useful for the detection of a monoclonality of atypical lymphocytes in an SMT of the gastrointestinal tract, and particularly for the detection of chromosomal translocations specific to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
