<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the possible relatedness of the subpopulations that make up so-called biclonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, we examined five bigenotypic and biphenotypic follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> using DNA probes specific for the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation, which is a characteristic feature of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On Southern blot analysis, both subpopulations from four of five <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> contained comigrating t(14;18) DNA rearrangements, confirming the single cell origins for these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No comigrating t(14;18) DNA rearrangements were observed in the fifth <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but nucleotide sequence analysis of cloned, breakpoint DNA showed identical t(14;18) crossovers in the two subpopulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The migration differences of both the Ig and chromosome 18 DNA rearrangements were shown to result from somatically acquired mutations of the Ig genes from the fifth <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These studies indicate that Ig gene rearrangements and idiotope expression are not consistently stable clonal markers since they are subject to variability as a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although translocated chromosome 18 DNA rearrangements are more reliable, they may also vary among cells of some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> since <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> can affect, as well, DNA of translocated alleles in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
