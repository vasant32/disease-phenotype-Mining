<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To understand the biologic mechanisms of this extremely effective response, we compared by microarray the gene-expression profile of patients' biopsies taken before and after radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, a major and consistent induction of p53 target genes was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>p53 targets involved in cell-cycle arrest and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> showed the same mode of regulation, indicating that, in vivo, both are activated simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>p53 up-regulation and p53-mediated proliferation arrest and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were substantiated using immunohistochemistry, with activation of both the intrinsic and the extrinsic apoptotic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other induced genes revealed a whole set of biologically meaningful genes related to macrophage activation and TH1 immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis suggested a specific activation or differentiation of resident macrophages by apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These biologic insights are important arguments to advocate the use of low-dose radiotherapy as an effective palliative treatment for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this study is the first in vivo report of the radiation-induced p53 apoptotic response in patients and suggests that this apoptotic response is not immunologically silent </plain></SENT>
