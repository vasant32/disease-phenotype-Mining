<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Immunoperoxidase study can be performed either on fixed and paraffin embedded biopsy specimens or on frozen sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Advantages and limits of these two methods, as well as the results obtained on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathologic lymphoid tissue are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunoperoxidase on paraffin sections (<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> technic) is a simple method which allows a good morphologic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, most of the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50913">fixatives</z:chebi> destroy proteic antigens particularly those linked to the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus surface immunoglobulins (S.Ig) cannot be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast cytoplasmic immunoglobulins remain antigenic enough to be demonstrated in routine paraffin embedded sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> synthesizing monotypic immunoglobulins, the percentage of labelled cells varies from 5 to 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Beside the background staining, which can be attenuated by trypsinisation, absorption of extracellular substances is often responsible for a false positive staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pathologists are mainly confronted with the passive uptake of extracellular immunoglobulins (IgG K and IgG L), as well as other serum proteins (lysozyme etc...) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunoperoxidase on frozen sections allows the use of monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A large number of surface and cytoplasmic antigens can be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>First, the localization of B and T lymphocytes, NK cells, interdigitating cells and dendritic reticulum cells within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymph node is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the second part, the interest of monoclonal antibodies in differential diagnosis between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and pseudo-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and in phenotyping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Now, it is possible to perform an in situ immunologic characterization of most <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> have sIg associated with other antigens (Pan B+, HLA-DR+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and centrocytic (cleaved-cell) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> frequently express T65 (T 101+ or Leu 1+) antigen which is usually found on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or neoplastic T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal antibodies provide new evidence of the germinal centre origin of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Thus, monoclonal antibody directed against dentritic reticulum cells (CRD) revealed the same network of DRC in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> as in reactive germinal centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This finding could account for the nodular pattern of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, neoplastic cells being in some way, enclosed within the DRC network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, neoplastic follicles are surrounded by a large amount of t lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Some T lymphocytes are also found within the follicles where they are associated with NK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Lastly, as reactive benign follicles, neoplastic follicles are labelled by the anti-Calla antibody.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
