<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reported herein is a case of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with extensive lymph node infiltration by eosinophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient was a 71-year-old woman who had a mass in the vicinity of the pancreas found on routine ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequent CT indicated several enlarged abdominal lymph nodes, although superficial lymph nodes were not palpable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two swollen mesenteric lymph nodes were excised to determine the cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histology indicated extensive infiltration of numerous eosinophils to the interfollicular area, especially in the dilated sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lymphoid follicles were relatively small, had inconspicuous germinal centers, and were scattered between dilated sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on the histology, immunohistochemistry, and chromosomal abnormality, a diagnosis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-5, eotaxin, eotaxin-2, and eotaxin-3 was investigated on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of the lymph node tissue, but none of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels were elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was a unique case of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with extensive eosinophil infiltration, and to the best of the authors' knowledge this is the first such case ever reported </plain></SENT>
