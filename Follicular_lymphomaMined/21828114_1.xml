<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: The Radioimmunotherapy Network (RIT-N) is a Web-based, international registry collecting long-term observational data about radioimmunotherapy-treated patients with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> outside randomized clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The RIT-N collects unbiased data on treatment indications, disease stages, patients' conditions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes, and hematologic side effects of radioimmunotherapy treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: RIT-N is located at the University of Göttingen, Germany, and collected data from 14 countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were entered by investigators into a Web-based central database managed by an independent clinical research organization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients (1,075) were enrolled from December 2006 until November 2009, and 467 patients with an observation time of at least 12 mo were included in the following analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses were as follows: 58% follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 42% other B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean overall survival was 28 mo for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 26 mo for other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hematotoxicity was mild for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (World Health Organization grade II), with a median nadir of 10 g/dL, but severe (World Health Organization grade III) for platelets and leukocytes, with a median nadir of 7,000/μL and 2.2/μL, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clinical usage of radioimmunotherapy differs from the labeled indications and can be assessed by this registry, enabling analyses of outcome and toxicity data beyond clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This analysis proves that radioimmunotherapy in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes is a safe and efficient treatment option </plain></SENT>
