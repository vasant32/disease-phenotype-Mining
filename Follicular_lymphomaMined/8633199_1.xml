<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The immunoglobulin kappa chain gene of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line HF-1.3.4 was partially sequenced from the 3' end of the leader exon 2.0 kb downstream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sequenced stretch of DNA included 1.5 kb of the non-coding JK region 3' to the JK2 element of the mature gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the known VK germline genes the closet relative was KV328, which was 91% homologous to HF-1.3.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the 1.5 kb JK region homology with JK allele of Whitehurst et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(allele 2) was 89%, with the allele of Hieter et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(allele 1) 87% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of the differences located in the leader intron, the VJ exon or 0.6 kb 3' to the exon, a localization characteristic of somatic hypermutations of immunoglobulin genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Another indication that most of the differences observed were due to somatic hypermutations is that the 153 bp stretch of the kappa constant gene (CK) sequenced from the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was 100% homologous with the published CK sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most differences between the JK region sequence and that of Whitehurst et al. probably represent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo>: 43% were transversions, 55% transitions and 2% deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the non-coding JK region transversions of C.G to G.C rather than to A.T were heavily over-represented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is possibly a feature of B-cell hypermutations in humans and mice </plain></SENT>
