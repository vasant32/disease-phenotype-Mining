<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>B-cell activating factor receptor (BAFF-R) is one of three known receptors for BAFF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BAFF-R is required for B-cell maturation and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tried to determine the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern of BAFF-R expression in non-neoplastic and neoplastic B- and T-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression pattern of BAFF-R in non-neoplastic and neoplastic lymphoid tissues of routinely fixed paraffin-embedded samples, and examined the relationships among BAFF-R and expressions of CD10, bcl-6, MUM-1, and MIB-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BAFF-R expression was detected on B-cells of the mantle zones, some cells within germinal centers, and scattered cells in the interfollicular areas of reactive lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BAFF-R expression was only found in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (60/120, positive samples/examined samples), but not in T/NK cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (0/10) or Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (0/10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportions were as follows : follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (14/16), diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) (27/61), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (4/4), and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (0/4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to Hans' criteria, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> were subclassified into germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) and non-germinal center B-cell-like (non-GCB) types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in nodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, in the GCB subgroup (n=12), 9 of 12 (75%) were positive for BAFF-R, while 6 of 20 (30%) were positive in the non-GCB subgroup (n=20) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, expression of BAFF-R related to lower MIB-1 index was associated with GCB-type <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, BAFF-R was only found in some B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, which was closely associated with the expression pattern in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterparts, although BAFF-R expression on follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is different from that on germinal center cells, which is similar to bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>BAFF-R was rather specifically related to low growth activity of GCB-type <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> of nodal origin </plain></SENT>
