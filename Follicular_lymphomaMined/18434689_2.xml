<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to show that the histopathological type of an orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> can differ from the systemic follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that precedes it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 44-year-old man (Patient #1) and a 50-year-old man (Patient #2) presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008940'>generalized lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> due to grade 1 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> proven on lymph node biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient #1 was followed without treatment for 16 years when he developed a right orbital mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient #2 underwent several courses of combination chemotherapy as well as radiation but relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second biopsy of the lymph node nine years later showed the same histopathological type of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He developed an orbital mass on the right side 16 years after the initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Patient #1, excisional biopsy of the orbital masses showed extranodal marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Patient #2, biopsy revealed the orbital mass to be T-cell/histiocyte-rich diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Patient #1, when comparing the original lymph node biopsy to the orbital biopsy obtained years later, no evidence for clonality was noted by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In Patient #2, the amplification by polymerase chain reaction of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement in the lymph node lesion and the orbital lesion gave rise to a single discrete band with the same DNA sequence except for five nucleotide changes, indicating the same clonality in the presence of genomic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> can occur as a second <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with a different histopathological type in the long-term follow-up of systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The original and subsequent lymphomatous lesions may or may not share neoplastic cell clonality and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> genomics </plain></SENT>
