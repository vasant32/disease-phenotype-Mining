<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Those who were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (body mass index &gt;/= 30) were up to three times more likely to develop NHL or its major subtypes than persons with body mass index of 20 to &lt;25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo>-related genetic factors including common polymorphisms in the leptin gene (LEP A19G and G-2548A) and its receptor (LEPR Q223R) were investigated in DNA available for 376 patients and 805 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that regulates food intake and modulates immune and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> through its receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among those with the LEP 19G allele, an increased risk estimate was found for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL [OR = 1.6, confidence interval (CI) 1.1-2.3], DLCL (OR = 1.6, CI 0.86-3.0), and FL <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR = 1.9, CI 0.98-3.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gene-gene interaction existed between the -G2548A and LEPR Q223R polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specifically, among those with LEPR 223RR, the risk estimate for NHL was increased in LEP -2548GA (OR = 1.7, CI 0.88-3.1) and LEP -2548AA (OR = 2.3,CI 1.1-4.6) relative to LEP -2548GG genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that genetic interactions between leptin and its receptor may promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune dysfunction</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and NHL and that the emerging <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> epidemic is consistent with the increasing incidence of NHL in developed countries </plain></SENT>
