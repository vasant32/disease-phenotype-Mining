<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We are reporting the first case of this subtype of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that was initially confined to the skin and remained so </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Light microscopy showed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> to be composed of monomorphous plump epithelioid cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm involving the dermis and subcutaneous fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic vacuoles were present within some of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, suggesting the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> with a signet ring appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some of the vacuoles were positive on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-Schiff with diastase staining, and no mucin was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining showed the presence of intracytoplasmic IgG heavy chains and kappa light chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Characteristic intracytoplasmic inclusions, which were formed by saccules and microvesicular bodies, were seen by electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of signet ring <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No systemic involvement was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Over a period of 7 years, multiple new <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> occurred, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which responded to radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This rare variant of follicular center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which can occur in the skin, should not be confused with metastatic mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>malignant melanoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
