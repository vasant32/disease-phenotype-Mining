<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunologically these cases were composed of 42 cases of nonT-nonB-, 135 cases of T-, 95 cases of B-, and 28 cases of possible (defective) B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The high ratio of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (45) is noteworthy and 63% of them were of peripheral T-cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some of the peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were difficult to subtype by the classical Rappaport classification and these were dealt with as separate entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lower frequency of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Japan was reconfirmed (22 of 95 B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) and half of the B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were diffuse large cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Morphologic characteristics, surface and other functional markers of the neoplastic cells in each subtype were presented in detail and discussed in relation to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> differentiation and maturation of lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
