<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although a strong determinant of these histological subtypes, this translocation is insufficient by itself for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e>, so that other genetic alterations are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify how the BCL2 translocation contributes to the development of specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes, we used chimeric mouse models and a bone marrow transplantation system to examine the biological features of BCL2-overexpressing B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These cells showed a cell-autonomous differentiation preference for follicular B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their cell cycle progression was enhanced in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> but not in Emu-BCL2 transgenic mice, indicating that the low proliferative activity of B cells in Emu-BCL2 transgenic mice is partly due to their specific microenvironment, which is caused by the abnormal B cells themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in vitro experiments demonstrated that Emu-BCL2(+) B cells have reduced responsiveness to terminal differentiation stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to these results, we hypothesize that B cells that have undergone BCL2/IGH translocation might possibly be forced to localize in follicles, and accumulate genetic abnormalities by being subjected to recurrent stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings lead us to propose that B cells carrying the BCL2/IGH translocation comprise a distinctive cell population that leads to the development of germinal center B-cell type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
