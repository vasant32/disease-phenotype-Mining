<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied advanced-stage FL patients from a single institution phase 2 trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated uniformly with multiagent chemotherapy and radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissue microarrays were constructed using diagnostic biopsies available in 105 patients and stained with CD4, CD8, CD25, and forkhead/winged helix transcription factor 3 (FOXP3) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both cell content and cell distribution were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> antibodies, there were cases with a predominant intrafollicular or perifollicular localization of cells (follicular pattern) while others displayed a diffuse pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up of living patients was 17.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The International Prognostic Index score predicted overall survival (OS; P = .004) but not risk of transformation (RT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cell content did not impact survival, while immunoarchitectural patterns of CD4/CD8 were significant for progression-free survival (PFS; P = .056), CD25 for both PFS and OS (P = .002 and P = .024, respectively), and FOXP3(+) predicted PFS, OS, and RT (P = .001, P &lt; .001 and p = .002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A Cox multivariate model showed both International Prognostic Index score and FOXP3(+) pattern were independent predictors of OS (P = .008 and P &lt; .001, respectively), while only FOXP3(+) pattern predicted RT (P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that FOXP3(+) cell distribution significantly predicts survival and RT in FL </plain></SENT>
