<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Recent molecular data have suggested that non-neoplastic cells are powerful modulators that may confer a selective advantage or disadvantage on the outcome of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The prevalence of the principal inflammatory and immune-infiltrated cells was measured immunohistochemically in the tissue of 211 FL patients, and associations were sought with their traditional clinicobiologic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our results confirmed the presence of a large number of T lymphocytes (CD4+ and CD8+) and CD57+ cells and, at a moderate level, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>-1+ cytotoxic cells, CD68+ macrophages, CD123+ plasmacytoid cells, and FOXP3+ regulatory T cells among the pool of non-neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to the conventional clinical variables, univariate analysis identified a low level of infiltrated CD8+ T lymphocytes as a significantly negative prognostic factor of overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following significant differences in the abundance of cells of specific and nonspecific immunity were observed in relation to the clinicobiologic features of FL: (1) a reactive microenvironment mainly made up of T lymphocytes and macrophages was significantly associated with a favorable clinical behavior of FL patients; and (2) a reactive microenvironment infiltrated predominantly by CD57+ T cells was associated with a significantly higher frequency of adverse clinicobiologic manifestations such as "B" symptoms and bone marrow involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate the existence of two specific patterns in the reactive microenvironment of FL, an immunosurveillance pattern (T lymphocytes and macrophages) and an immune-escape pattern (CD57+ T cells), that were directly associated with the clinicobiologic features of these patients </plain></SENT>
