<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most breaks on chromosome 18 are located at the 3'-UTR of the BCL2 gene and are mainly clustered in the major breakpoint region (MBR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, we found that the BCL2 MBR has a non-B DNA character in genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9160">single-stranded DNA</z:chebi> modeled from the template strand of the BCL2 MBR, forms secondary structures that migrate faster on native PAGE in the presence of <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>, due to the formation of intramolecular G-quadruplexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Circular dichroism shows evidence for a parallel orientation for G-quadruplex structures in the template strand of the BCL2 MBR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutagenesis and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DMS</z:e> modification assay confirm the presence of three <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> tetrads in the structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>1H nuclear magnetic resonance studies further confirm the formation of an intramolecular G-quadruplex and a representative model has been built based on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the experimental evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also provide data consistent with the possible formation of a G-quadruplex structure at the BCL2 MBR within mammalian cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, these important features could contribute to the single-stranded character at the BCL2 MBR, thereby contributing to chromosomal fragility </plain></SENT>
