<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One hundred forty-eight patients with newly diagnosed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were treated over a 12-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients received radiotherapy for stage I and II disease, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred thirteen were treated at presentation with short courses of chemotherapy, most often with single-agent <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> for bulky stage II and stages III and IV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients were managed expectantly until there was evidence of disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median survival was 9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with radiotherapy for stage I and II disease had an 83% relapse-free survival, but those with bulky stage II or stages III and IV disease treated with chemotherapy pursued a remitting and relapsing course with a 70% response rate at initial and subsequent retreatments, but a median duration of remission of 4 years in stage III and 1 year in stage IV disease (P = .041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were observed in relapse and retreatment was administered as appropriate, once every 33 months on average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Poor prognosis patients could be identified by a combination of the presentation characteristics: B symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>abnormal liver function</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These factors predicted a poor response to treatment and correlated with a short survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histologic subgroups were not associated with differences in survival, but transformation to a diffuse high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was observed in 23 of the 72 patients (32%) at risk, with a median follow-up of 6 years and 6 months, and was associated with a very poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present treatment strategy has proved successful for most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e> and those older patients with indolent small volume disseminated follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>New approaches are being investigated for the younger poor prognosis patients </plain></SENT>
