<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Fludarabine monophosphate (FAMP) is a major drug in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and showed efficacy in selected groups of patients with low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, most of them pretreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this trial was to assess the efficacy and the toxicity of FAMP in untreated patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-four untreated patients with advanced follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were treated with intravenous (i.v.) fludarabine at a dose of 25 mg/m2/d during 5 days every 4 weeks, to a maximum of nine cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The toxicity of the drug was mild, mainly granulocytic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>Granulocytopenia</z:hpo> &gt; or = 3 (World Health Organization [WHO]) was observed during 48 of 328 cycles (14.6%) and in 22 of 53 (41%) patients assessable for toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fludarabine had to be stopped prematurely because of toxicity in nine patients: marrow toxicity in five, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> in two, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006515'>interstitial pneumonitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> in one patient each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 49 patients assessable for response, the overall response rate was 65% and the complete response (CR) rate 37% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median progression-free survival interval for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 13.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results confirm that fludarabine is active when used as first-line treatment in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and has a low toxicity rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It may be used as single treatment in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Associations of fludarabine with other drugs active against follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> need to be determined </plain></SENT>
