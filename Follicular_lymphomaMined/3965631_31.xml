<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A collaborative study between the Repository Center for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Clinical Studies and the members of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> pathology subcommittee of the major cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> groups was undertaken in an effort to ascertain the reproducibility and the interobserver agreement for the cytologic diagnosis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A group of 105 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were subclassified by seven hematopathologists according to two methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first method, cases were subclassified according to the Rappaport, Lukes, and Collins, and Working Formulation systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these systems, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are subclassified by estimation of the different cell populations without the actual counting of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With this method, great variability in diagnosis was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For example: (1) The consensus diagnosis was that of poorly differentiated lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="53413">PDL</z:chebi>) in 39 cases, but among the individual pathologists the number of cases thus diagnosed ranged from 24 to 65; (2) In 40 cases, the consensus diagnosis was follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mixed-cell type; however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven pathologists independently agreed on this subtype in only one case; (3) A major disagreement was noted in 39 cases (37%), in which both diagnostic extremes (small cleaved and large noncleaved) were expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the second method, only precise counts of different cells were made, according to a modification of the method recommended by Berard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With this counting method, diagnoses were independently derived based on the counts provided by the seven pathologists for large cleaved, small noncleaved, and large noncleaved cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The variability in the results was wide also with this second method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For example, the average number of large cells found by each pathologist was ascertained, and the ranges were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average range was 28 cells, which was considered high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The same determinations were performed only for large noncleaved cells, and the range was found to be 15 cells, which was also considered high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When the diagnoses derived from counts of only large noncleaved cells were compared with the traditional, more subjective diagnoses, fairly close agreement was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In summary, the great variability in diagnoses of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> among pathologists may be attributed to the difficulties inherent in accurate determination of cell size and of the precise percentages of different cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Until solutions to these problems are developed, one can subclassify follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> according to the Berard method or the estimation method </plain></SENT>
