<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nasal natural killer (NK)-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was resistant to various antitumor agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although high expression of p-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> has been reported, other molecular mechanism of the chemo-resistance is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Activation of STAT3 and expression of major <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-x, and Mcl-1 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Effects of STAT3 inhibitor AG490 on NK-YS cell line were analyzed by Western blotting and flow cytometric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STAT3 was activated in six of the nine nasal NK-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, STAT3 activation was detected in 35% of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and in 10% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Frequent activation of STAT3 was significantly correlated with Mcl-1 expression in nasal NK-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, i.e., Mcl-1 was positive in five of six STAT3-active cases and negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three STAT3-inactive ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, not only six out of seven STAT3-active cases (86%) but also eight out of thirteen STAT3-inactive cases (62%) were positive for Mcl-1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Latent membrane protein-1 was positive in four nasal NK-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, among which three cases showed intermediate STAT3 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of STAT3 activation by JAK inhibitor AG490 decreased Mcl-1 expression and induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in STAT3-active NK-YS cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serum starvation rather increased the Mcl-1 level in NK-YS cells, and this effect was also canceled by AG490 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that activation of STAT3-Mcl-1 axis may play a role in the chemotherapy resistance of nasal NK-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The pathway may be one of the future therapeutic targets of this intractable disease </plain></SENT>
