<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a sequential chemotherapy plus radioimmunotherapy (RIT) regimen in previously untreated follicular non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five patients received an abbreviated course (three cycles) of fludarabine followed 6 to 8 weeks later by tositumomab and <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> I 131 tositumomab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After fludarabine, 31 (89%) of 35 patients responded, with three (9%) of 31 patients achieving a complete response (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the full regimen of fludarabine and <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> I 131 tositumomab, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 35 patients responded; 30 (86%) of 35 patients achieved CR, and five (14%) of 35 achieved partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 58 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) had not been reached (95% CI, 27 months to not reached), but it will be at least 48 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 5-year estimated PFS rate is 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) was significantly associated (P = .003) with PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five of six patients with more than 25% bone marrow involvement at baseline achieved adequate bone marrow cytoreduction to receive standard-dose <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> I 131 tositumomab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten (77%) of 13 patients with baseline bone marrow Bcl-2 positivity demonstrated molecular remissions at month 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Toxicities were manageable and principally hematologic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two (6%) of 35 patients developed human antimurine antibodies (HAMA) after RIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Use of abbreviated fludarabine before <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> I 131 tositumomab can reduce bone marrow involvement, when needed, to allow the use of RIT and can suppress HAMA responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This sequential treatment regimen is highly effective as front-line therapy for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, particularly for low- or intermediate-risk FLIPI patients </plain></SENT>
