<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Acquisition of t(8;14) by follicular-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells with t(14;18) has also been related to the clinical transformation into an overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> in rare cases reported, and a role for c-myc involvement in the progression of some follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with t(14;18) has been suggested by the detection of c-myc rearrangements in association with histologic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, c-myc abnormalities different from those observed in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> have been reported in diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with breakpoints in 8q24, and a t(8;14) molecularly different from the classical one has been found in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> without t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the preliminary characterization of the EBV-negative cell line U 2904 established from a transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that carries both t(8;14) (q24;q32) and t(14;18) (q32;q21) translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>U 2904 cells have a mature B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp>, grow in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> and are tumorigenic in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rearrangements of both c-myc and bcl-2 confirmed the involvement of both oncogenes in the translocations which lead to abundant c-myc and bcl-2 transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two JH rearrangements and one C alpha rearrangement were observed which did not co-migrate with either c-myc or bcl-2 rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of a cell line bearing both t(8;14) and t(14;18) derived from a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> after documented transformation into a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> without leukemic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>U 2904 provides further evidence for the involvement of c-myc in the progression of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
