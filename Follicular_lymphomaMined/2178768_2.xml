<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study monoclonal antibodies which recognize lymphoid-associated antigens on paraffin sections (LN1, MB2, L26, MT2, UCHL1) have been evaluated to assess their usefulness in the distinction between reactive and neoplastic lesions of lymphoid follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples and 36 reactive samples (lymph nodes and tonsils) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MT2 appeared as the most valuable immunophenotypic marker as emerged from a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of 2329 reactive follicles and 2288 neoplastic follicles performed on MT2 immunostained sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MT2-positive follicles were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples but one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall 1908 of 2288 neoplastic follicles were judged as positive whereas no follicles with comparable strong MT2 immunoreactivity could be found in non neoplastic samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These latter showed weak MT2 positivity only in about 10% (224/2329) of reactive follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study confirms that MT2 follicular positivity can be considered a reliable marker of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, although negative results ought to be considered with caution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The detection of centrofollicular cells outside the germinal centers, which is considered a reliable criterion of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, was highly improved by LN1 immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand pan-B antibodies such as L26 and MB2 were less informative because of the large number of B-lymphocytes observed in interfollicular areas of nonneoplastic samples </plain></SENT>
