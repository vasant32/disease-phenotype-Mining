<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although several different histological types seem to be capable of giving rise to prominent splenic involvement, the authors, on the basis of the reported findings, suggest the possibility that some cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> presenting with conspicuous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> and which at present are classified in the group of the so-called intermediate lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, might be an expression of proliferation of a cell type normally recognizable in the marginal zone of the splenic follicles </plain></SENT>
