<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT A common treatment for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is rituximab monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify patients for whom this regimen is adequate as first-line therapy, we applied the World Health Organization (WHO) classification for grading follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in a prospective central pathology review of the biopsies of previously untreated patients in two randomized trials of rituximab without chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first trial (N1=53), higher WHO grades correlated with longer time to next treatment, independently of clinical prognostic factors (p=0.030); the finding was replicated in the second trial (N2=221; p=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Higher grades were associated with better treatment responses (p=0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, also grades externally confirmed by independent local pathologists correlated with time to next treatment (p=0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry in a separate patient series showed that the intensity of CD20 increased with the malignant cells' size (p&lt;0.00005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, WHO grade 1 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> correlates with inferior outcome after rituximab monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>WHO grading might provide a clinically useful tool for personalized therapy </plain></SENT>
