<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most conversions have involved changes from nodular to diffuse patterns and often from small to larger cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conversions to undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, but not specifically to the Burkitt's type, have infrequently been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This report describes three cases of nodular poorly differentiated lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that converted to a Burkitt's-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversion was associated with short survivals, increasing <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and changes in DNA stemline, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> content, and S-phase values, as determined by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Karyotypes in two cases revealed a t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surface immunoglobulin could be demonstrated on transformed Burkitt's-like cells from lymph node in one case, but in none of the cases on cells from bone marrow </plain></SENT>
