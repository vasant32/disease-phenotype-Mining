<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, with the exception of anecdotal reports, most patients have received no more than 10 doses of their customised idiotype (Id) vaccine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is not known whether prolonged usage of idiotypic vaccination is safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since 2002, 18 previously treated patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> have received extended idiotypic vaccination at our institution outside clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vaccination was provided as a compassionate alternative to no further treatment, and was meant to be stopped only upon complete consumption of the available patient- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific vaccine [Id-keyhole limpet hemocyanin + granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Id-KLH + GM-CSF)], or in case of disease relapse or any serious non-local toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>So far, 18 patients have received an average of 18 doses of Id vaccine (median: 17; mean: 18; range: 10-31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients are still actively receiving idiotypic vaccination: some of them are now over more than 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Toxicity has been systematically negligible and mostly local </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patient has abandoned the vaccination program because of toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prolonged idiotypic vaccination with the soluble protein Id-KLH + GM-CSF formulation is safe and well tolerated </plain></SENT>
