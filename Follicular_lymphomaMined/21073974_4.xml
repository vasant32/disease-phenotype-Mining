<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can extend progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), but relapse is the primary cause of failure </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allows the performance of allogeneic HCT with lower toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network conducted a prospective multicenter trial comparing these two strategies in patients with relapsed, chemotherapy-sensitive FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were assigned to a treatment arm based on the availability of an HLA-matched sibling donor (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 36 months (range, 1-51 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>OS was 73% in autologous HCT versus 100% in allogeneic HCT, and PFS was 63% in autologous HCT versus 86% in allogeneic HCT </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This trial closed early because of slow accrual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We show that the FCR regimen is well tolerated, and that both allogeneic and autologous HCT result in promising 3-year OS and PFS in patients with relapsed FL </plain></SENT>
