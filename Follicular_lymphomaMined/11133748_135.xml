<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients with follicular CD20(+) NHL and a low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden were analyzed for clinical and molecular responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They received 4 weekly infusions of rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The response rate a month after treatment (day 50) was 36 of 49 (73%), with 10 patients in complete remission, 3 patients in complete remission/unconfirmed, and 23 patients in partial remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had stable disease, and the disease progressed in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of 13 (8%) patients in complete remission, 9 of 23 (39%) patients in partial remission, and 5 of 10 (50%) patients with stable disease exhibited disease progression during the first year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within the study population, 32 patients were initially informative for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) data on bcl-2-J(H) rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On day 50, 17 of 30 patients (57%) were negative for bcl-2-J(H) rearrangement in peripheral blood, and 9 of 29 (31%) were negative in bone marrow; a significant association was observed between molecular and clinical responses (P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At month 12, 16 of 26 patients (62%) were PCR negative in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that early molecular responses can be sustained for up to 12 months and that this response is highly correlated with progression-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rituximab has a high clinical activity and a low toxicity and induces a high complete molecular response rate in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and a low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden </plain></SENT>
