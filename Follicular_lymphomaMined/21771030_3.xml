<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) in situ is defined as strongly bcl-2-positive B cells in germinal centres of morphologically inconspicuous lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence and biological and clinical significance of this lesion are still not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore we aimed at the detection of the prevalence of this phenomenon in an unselected series of lymph nodes, as a surrogate for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 1294 reactive lymph nodes from unselected consecutive surgical specimens of 132 patients in a 3-month period were stained for bcl-2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18) translocation was investigated by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FL in situ was identified in 22 lymph nodes in 3/132 patients (2.3%) without evidence or history of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and confirmed by detection of the t(14;18) translocation by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in one patient, a lymph node excised 2 years before also contained FL in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found a prevalence of 2.3% for FL in situ lesions in an unselected series of lymph nodes, as a surrogate for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taking into account the incidence of manifest FL, the risk of progression of this lesion is probably limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It can be speculated that some FL in situ lesions do indeed represent an early step in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e>, whereas others persist without further progression to overt FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The underlying mechanisms, however, remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
