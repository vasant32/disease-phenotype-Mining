<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nucleotide sequencing of BCL-6 cDNA predicted a protein containing six zinc-finger domains, suggesting that it may function as a transcription factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using antisera raised against N- and C-terminal BCL-6 synthetic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25676">oligopeptides</z:chebi> in immunoprecipitation, immunoblot, and immunocytochemical assays, this study identifies the BCL-6 gene product as a 95-kD nuclear protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines representative of various hematopoietic lineages/stages of differentiation showed that the BCL-6 protein is predominantly expressed in the B-cell lineage where it was found in mature B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human lymphoid tissues indicated that BCL-6 expression is topographically restricted to germinal centers including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> centroblasts and centrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The BCL-6 protein was also detectable in inter- and intra-follicular CD4+ T cells, but not in other follicular components including mantle-zone B cells, plasma cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of DLCL and FL biopsy samples showed that the BCL-6 protein is detectable in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> independent of the presence of BCL-6 gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the expression of the BCL-6 gene is specifically regulated during B-cell differentiation and suggest a role for BCL-6 in germinal center development or function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because DLCL derive from germinal-center B cells, deregulated BCL-6 expression may contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> by preventing postgerminal center differentiation </plain></SENT>
