<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> (FNA) is widely used to investigate posterior mediastinal and upper abdominal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we noticed that the aortoiliac bifurcation can be visualized by transduodenal EUS scanning, and the surrounding area might be a potential target for EUS-guided FNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine the feasibility of using EUS-guided FNA to study lesions near the aortoiliac bifurcation via the upper gastrointestinal approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was a prospective pilot study of consecutive patients with a lesion of unknown origin near the aortoiliac bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EUS-guided FNA was used in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aortoiliac bifurcation was visible from the inferior duodenal angle in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients; however, the lesions could be visualized in only five patients (3 via the transduodenal approach, and 2 via the transgastric approach) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one patient with a lesion on the left side, the lesion could not be visualized by either the transgastric or transduodenal approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the other five patients, EUS-guided FNA was successful, and FNA specimens were adequate for histopathological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> (n = 1), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100008'>neurinoma</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases were subclassified as diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 2) or grade 2 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The aortoiliac bifurcation was visible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients by transduodenal EUS scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>FNA of the legions near the aortoiliac bifurcation was possible in five of six patients by using either the transgastric or transduodenal approach </plain></SENT>
