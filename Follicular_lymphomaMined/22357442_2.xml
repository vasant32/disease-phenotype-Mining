<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PatieNTS AND METHODS: Patients with previously untreated FL (grades 1, 2, 3a) received 4 weekly infusions of G + R, followed by an additional dose every 2 months four times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>International Workshop Response Criteria were used to evaluate response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ResulTS: Sixty-one patients were treated and antibody infusions were well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate (ORR) is 72.1% (95% confidence interval 59.2% to 82.9%): 47.6% complete response (CR)/unconfirmed complete response (CRu) and 24.6% partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up time of 4.3 years (range, 0.3-5.3 years) median progression-free survival (PFS) is 2.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Notably, Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) correlated with ORR, CR rate, and PFS, and the low-risk FLIPI group (n = 12) achieved a 92% ORR, 75% CR/CRu rate, and 75% 3-year PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An extended induction schedule of G + R in previously untreated FL is well tolerated and appears particularly efficacious in those patients with low-risk FLIPI scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, this trial served as the initial platform for additional CALGB 'doublet' combination regimes of rituximab plus other novel targeted agents </plain></SENT>
