<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the efficacy and toxicity of oral fludarabine in combination with rituximab in patients with relapsed indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B-NHL), we conducted a multicenter phase II study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with relapsed indolent B-NHL with two or fewer prior regimens and up to 16 doses of rituximab were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received 375 mg/m(2) rituximab on day 1, and 40 mg/m(2) oral fludarabine once daily on days 1 through 5 every 28 days for up to six cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the overall response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-one patients were enrolled, including 38 (93%) with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients (83%) had received rituximab as prior therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients (66%) completed the planned six cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dose reduction of oral fludarabine was required in 17 patients (41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 76% (31 of 41 patients; 95% confidence interval, 60-88%) with a complete response rate of 68% (28 of 41 patients; 95% confidence interval, 52-82%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival for the 41 patients was 19.7 months (95% confidence interval, 12.3-26.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hematological toxicities, including grade 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (68%), were the most frequent toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Non-hematological toxicities were mild, except for one patient who died of Pneumocystis jiroveci <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> 4 months after the protocol treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, oral fludarabine in combination with rituximab is a highly effective and convenient therapy for patients with relapsed indolent B-NHL who have mostly been pretreated with rituximab </plain></SENT>
