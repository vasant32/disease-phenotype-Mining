<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: One of the perspective therapeutic possibilities in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) is the fludarabine-based regimen FND (fludarabine, mitoxantron, dexamethason) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However serious signs of myelotoxicity and significant immunosuppression with appearance of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">opportunistic infections</z:e> were described after the fludarabine treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients with advanced disease grade I-II were treated with FND (6-8 cycles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immunotoxicity</z:e> was evaluated by measuring of immunoglobuline levels (IgA, IgG, IgM) and that of lymphocytes subpopulations (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD20+, CD56+) in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The myelotoxicity was evaluated by cultures of progenitor cells (CFC and LTC-IC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Totally 34 patients (median age 55.5 years) were evaluated, the overall response was 72% (CR 61%, PR 11%, progression 28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>73% patients of 11 after 6-8 FND show persisting CR (27% relapsed) with median follow-up about 15 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The dominating toxicity was myelotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leucopenia</z:e> grade III-IV occurred in about 30% cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because of toxicity it was necessary to reduce doses of FND in 10% cycles and this treatment had to be finished ahead of schedule in 29% patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596763" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immunotoxicity</z:e> was found only in the decrease of whole lymphocyte population (p &lt; 0.05) and of IgG level (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The decrease of lymphocyte subpopulations did not reach any statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The long-term myelotoxicity caused the decrease of LTC-IC that had a clinical correlation with the very difficult mobilization of PBSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FND is efficient in treatment of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However myelotoxicity seems to be limiting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Myelotoxicity doesn't allow administering scheduled dose of FND in substantial amount of patients, long-term myelotoxicity complicates PBSC-mobilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Lymphotoxicity is apparent, but seems not to be clinically important </plain></SENT>
