<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical and histoogical studies have been performed on paraffin sections of 19 cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the cases were lymphocytic in type and, on the basis of the National <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Investigation classification, 11 were follicular (six small, three mixed small and large, and two large cell types) and eight were diffuse (four intermediate, three poorly and one well-differentiated types) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Marshall's metalophil method revealed a population of dendritic histiocytes in and around the follicles of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the dendritic cells within the neoplastic follicles resembled the distribution of similar cells in reactive follicles, lending support to the concept of an origin for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> follicles from their reactive counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the diffuse lesions the dendritic cells were large and more pleomorphic than in the follicular lesions, but these features were not so pronounced as those previously observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> sequence was used to demonstrate Ig, and as judged by the types of light and heavy chains in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, the cases were divided into three groups: Group 1 (eight cases) in which the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells contained monotypic Ig; Group 2 (six cases) in which monotypic Ig was probably present; and Group 3 (four cases) where no evidence of monotypic Ig secretion was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Monotypic Ig was most commonly found in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, mu kappa secretion being the most frequently identified combination of heavy and light chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of cases (73 per cent.) were thus clearly derived from B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the fact that monoclonality was evident in only a proportion of cases suggested that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> may be polyclonal initially and proportion of cases suggested that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> may be polyclonal initially and that monoclonality is a later development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mature plasma cells containing a high concentration of intracellular Ig were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one of the lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Ig was polytypic, cells containing kappa and lambda chains being present in roughly equal numbers and gamma chains pre-dominating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Extracellular Ig (gamma, mu, kappa, lambda) was also present in many lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Collections of small non-lymphomatous lymphocytes were also present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In eight lesions these appeared to have polytypic surface Ig (mu, kappa, lambda) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Dendritic cells mingled with these lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Collections of small lymphocytes non-reactive for Ig were also present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These had no association with dendritic histiocytes and might have been T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that in most cases immunohistochemistry alone provides an insufficient basis for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and that disturbance of cellular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and tissue architecture remain the most useful criteria on which the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> rests </plain></SENT>
