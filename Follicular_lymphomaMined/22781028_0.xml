<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007129" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Merkel cell cancer</z:e> cohorts and the lymphotropic properties of the virus suggest a possible <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate this potential role, we explored seroreactivity against MCV VP1 capsids within the Epilymph case-control study in Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum samples from 468 incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, categorized into up to 11 entities, and 522 controls frequency matched by age, sex, and recruitment center were tested for MCV antibodies by enzyme immunoassay using Virus-Like-Particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adjusted multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate the OR and 95% confidence interval (CI) associated to MCV seroprevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppressed subjects were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MCV seroprevalence was 82% in controls and 85% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> categories, MCV seropositivity was significantly higher in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>; 96.4%; OR = 6.1, 95%CI = 1.9-19.8), as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MCV prevalences were also higher in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and mature T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but differences did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lower prevalences were observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> and other B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Exclusion of samples collected after start of treatment did not change the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a subset analysis, no significant association was observed between BKV and JCV seroprevalence and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The association observed between serologic evidence of MCV exposure and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> warrants further research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: MCV might be involved in the pathway of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
