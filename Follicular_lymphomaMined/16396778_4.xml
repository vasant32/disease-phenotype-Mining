<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a rare example of a histologic transformation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> manifested by prolymphocytoid <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and an unusual immunophenotype characterized by coexpression of CD5 and CD10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The transformed prolymphocytoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was positive for CD5 and CD10 antigens by both flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The case also expressed bcl-2 and bcl-6 proteins, and exhibited t(14;18), consistent with derivation from a pre-existing follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction analysis of the immunoglobulin kappa light chain genes derived from the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and prolymphocytoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed identical rearranged bands, suggesting clonal identity of the two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The basis for coexpression of CD5 and CD10 remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because the preceding low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was positive only for CD10 and did not express CD5, CD5 expression appears to be an acquired phenomenon accompanying the process of histologic transformation in this particular case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prolymphocytoid transformation, similar to other histologic forms of transformation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, appears to accompany clinical progression of disease </plain></SENT>
