<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: A multicenter, single-arm study examining efficacy and toxicity of epratuzumab combined with rituximab was conducted in patients with recurrent or refractory non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-five patients were enrolled; 34 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), 15 patients with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), and 16 patients with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients had received a median of two prior therapies (range, 1 to 4); 23% had received rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Epratuzumab was given at 360 mg/m2 intravenously over 60 minutes followed by infusion of 375 mg/m2 rituximab, weekly for 4 consecutive weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Combination therapy was well tolerated without greater toxicity than rituximab alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The objective response (OR) rate was 47% (30 of 64) in assessable patients (46%; 30 of 65 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients), being highest in FL (64%; 21 of 33) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (47%; seven of 15), and with 24% (eight of 33) and 33% (five of 15) achieving complete response (CR) or complete response unconfirmed (CRu) in these two groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of six patients with marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> responded to treatment (one CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a trend for the response rates to be higher in patients with low prognostic index scores (statistically significant with respect to the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index score in FL patients), with 12 FL patients and three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> patients in groups 0 to 1 having OR (CR/CRu) rates of 83% (33%) and 100% (100%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median duration of response was 16 months for FL, with five patients currently progression free for 18 months to 30 months, and 6 months for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, with two patients currently progression free for 12 months and 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Epratuzumab combined with rituximab was well tolerated, demonstrating promising antilymphoma activity that warrants additional study </plain></SENT>
