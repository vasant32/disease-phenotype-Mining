<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is the most common form of low-grade non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the Western Hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Identification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers that facilitate early disease detection would be a significant advance in the management of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have employed a strategy that entailed propagation of a follicular-derived cell line in serum-free media, protein extraction, and reverse-phase liquid chromatography, with subsequent electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry analysis for the identification of proteins that are released by FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a two-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> minimum per protein and standard criteria, 209 proteins (5.6% maximum predicted error rate) released from the FL cells were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The released proteins included several growth factors, cytokines, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase reactants and cellular components previously known to be present in FL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, a greater proportion of proteins previously unassociated with FL were identified with high statistical confidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our studies provide a list of proteins, which may be candidates for early screening, diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of patients with a suspected or biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of FL </plain></SENT>
