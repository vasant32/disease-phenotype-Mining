<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fludarabine was given at 25 mg/m2 for three daily doses, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> at 10 mg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cycles were repeated every four weeks for up to maximum response, and for no more than six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 11 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Objective response was observed in 11 of 12 previously untreated patients, including five complete remissions, and in 10 of 13 previously treated patients, including three complete remissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only two relapsed patients failed to respond, whereas two patients were not evaluable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hence, the overall response rate based on the intention-to-treat analysis was 84 per cent (95 per cent CI: 70-98 per cent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival has not been reached after a 22-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median time to progression was 15 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> developed pneumocystis carinii <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, and an elderly patient succumbed to neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Apart from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo>, the treatment was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Omission of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> reduces the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">opportunistic infections</z:e>, while the activity of the combination against indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and CLL is maintained </plain></SENT>
