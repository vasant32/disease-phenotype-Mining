<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> (FNA) has been used in the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> for a long time and is highly reliable in the identification of metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of FNA in the assessment of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> continues to be a subject of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the current study was to evaluate the role of molecular cytogenetic studies in FNA diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective, computer-based search for lymph node FNAs from 2006 to 2007 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases with either fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies were subjected to further analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 243 lymph node FNAs were performed during the period, including 104 that were positive/suspicious for metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, 16 that were positive/suspicious for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 15 that demonstrated atypical lymphoid proliferation, 73 that were reactive, 14 that were deemed granulomas, and 21 that were determined to be nondiagnostic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis included combined FISH/PCR in 4 cases, FISH only in 7 cases, and PCR only in 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By using multiplex PCR, 6 cases with atypical/negative flow cytometry results were diagnosed as 4 B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 1 T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 1 reactive lymph node; and 4 cases that had atypical T cells determined by flow cytometry were diagnosed as reactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One CD10-negative follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 2 cases with suspicious flow cytometry results were positive for t(14;18)(q32;q21) by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forty-five cases had follow-up histology with 3 false-negative findings and no false-positive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, multiplex PCR studies for immunoglobulin heavy-chain or T-cell receptor gene rearrangements were useful for demonstrating clonality, and FISH studies were able to detect translocations or gene rearrangements that allowed for the subclassification of B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
