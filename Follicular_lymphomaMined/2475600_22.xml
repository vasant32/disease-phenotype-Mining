<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three methods produced similar subdivisions to those obtained using the histological classification of the Working Formulation for clinical usage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty cases have been followed clinically to assess any relationship between these parameters and short-term (less than 4 years) survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each technique showed a trend towards identifying patients with a poor short-term prognosis with no one method being superior to any other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unless larger series with longer follow-up suggest otherwise, there is no indication to use either the AgNOR or Ki67 methods which offer no advantage over the simple and inexpensive Working Formulation or Berard's LNCC counting </plain></SENT>
