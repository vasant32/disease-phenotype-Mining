<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To retrospectively determine the potential role of additional computed tomography (CT) attenuation measurements for interim response evaluation in residual masses of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) and follicular non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, 39 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> and 35 patients with NHL presented with residual masses at mid-treatment CT (after 2-4 cycles of chemotherapy) and were assessed via contrast-enhanced CT at baseline, mid-treatment and post-treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Volume was recorded as whole-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> attenuation ratio (TAR) was calculated as the quotient of attenuation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> and muscle at the respective point in time versus baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The standard deviation of attenuation values within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> volume was recorded to estimate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results were correlated with relapse-free survival determined at a minimum of 12 months after end-treatment CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> volume and TAR at interim versus baseline control were significantly reduced in responders compared with non-responders, even after controlling for age, stage, treatment regimen, and baseline <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences with respect to the standard deviation of attenuation values within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> volumes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The volume and attenuation CT (VACT) criteria yielded the highest sensitivities and specificities for the identification of non-response at a threshold of a &gt;20% increase in volume and an increase in TAR at interim control, i.e. 88% (NHL 80%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> 100%) and 98% (NHL 97%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> 100%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The negative predictive values reached by VACT analysis were &gt;=97%, according to both parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Mid-treatment response assessment of residual masses in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> and NHL using VACT may aid in the risk stratification as an additional surrogate parameter </plain></SENT>
