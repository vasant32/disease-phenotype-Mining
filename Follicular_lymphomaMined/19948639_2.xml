<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 39-year-old Japanese male developed a mass in the right cervical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biopsy of the enlarged lymph node led to a diagnosis of PTGC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, 5 years later, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> recurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second biopsy specimens contained numerous germinal centers, including PTGC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although most follicles were cytologically reactive, a few GCs appeared to be somewhat monotonous, composed predominantly of centrocytes and lacking mitotic figures and tangible body macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that these atypical GCs were CD10+, CD20+, and bcl-2+, with Î»-light-chain restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A previous report emphasized the differential diagnostic problem between PTGC and the floral variant of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the present case indicated that in situ FL should be added to the list of differential diagnoses for PTGC </plain></SENT>
