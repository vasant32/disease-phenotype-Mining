<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The progression of indolent to aggressive FL is accompanied by the successive accumulation of recurrent chromosomal defects, but the resultant alterations of gene expression are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To expand the understanding of the pathogenesis of FL transformation, we initially performed oligonucleotide microarray analyses using Affymetrix HuFL chips on five cases with matched snap-frozen lymph nodes before and after transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression data were analyzed using the Affymetrix Microarray Suite 4.0 and Genespring 4.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six genes with increased expression and 66 genes with decreased expression associated with transformation were identified and functionally classified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of differentially expressed genes was confirmed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) using a total of seven matched pairs and an additional five FL and five unrelated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, selected genes were further analyzed by QRT-PCR or immunohistochemistry using a large, unrelated series of FL (grades 1 to 3) as well as transformed and de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (total of 51 samples) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The microarray results correlated with the protein expression data obtained from samples at the time of initial diagnosis and transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the expression of 25 candidate genes was evaluated by QRT-PCR with a 78% confirmation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some of the identified genes, such as nucleobindin, interferon regulatory factor 4, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, are already known to be associated with high-grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Novel candidate genes with confirmed increased and decreased expression in transformed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> include ABL2 and NEK2, and PDCD1 and VDUP1, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, this study shows that transformation of FL to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> is associated with a distinct set of differentially expressed genes of potential functional importance </plain></SENT>
