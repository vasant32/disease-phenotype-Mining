<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Routine histological examination was performed on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin stained sections of 24 bone marrow biopsies and available 6 concurrent lymph node specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry study was performed using EliVision methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 24 cases, the male-to-female ratio was 2.4:1 and the median age was 59.5 years (42 - 75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common symptom was <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> (83.3%, 20/24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hyperviscosity and "B" symptoms occurred in 20.8% (5/24) and 8.3% (2/24) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>41.7% (10/24) patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> were seen in 79.2% (19/24), 8.3% (2/24) and 37.5% (9/24) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal Ig light chain expression was detected by serum immunofixation electrophoresis in 23 cases (95.8%), including IgM (20 cases), IgG (2 cases) and IgA (1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Basing on the histology and immunohistochemistry findings, the diagnosis was made in 22 bone marrow and 2 lymph node biopsies, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the bone marrow and lymph node specimens composed of small lymphocytes, plasmacytoid lymphocytes and plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most frequent pattern of bone marrow involvement was diffuse in appearance (63.6%, 14/22), while nodular and interstitial patterns were less common (22.7%, 5/22 and 13.6%, 3/22, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lymph node involvement was also to be diffuse in pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The proliferative cells expressed Pax5, CD20, CD38 and CD138, but were negative for CD5, CD10, CD23, CyclinD1, CD3, CD7 and MPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LPL has distinct clinicopathological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Histological and immunohistochemistry findings are important for its differential diagnosis with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
