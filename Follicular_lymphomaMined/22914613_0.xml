<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We studied the sensitivity of 2 relatively new markers of germinal center B-cell origin, namely human germinal center-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (HGAL) and Lim-only transcription factor 2 (LMO2), in the identification of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs) of the nongastric gastrointestinal (GI) tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed cases of endoscopically derived primary, nongastric GI <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> including FL, grade 1 or 2, and extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ENMZL) of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, classified based on morphologic features and immunohistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HGAL and LMO2 immunohistochemical stains were then prospectively performed in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When discrepant immunohistochemical results were obtained, fluorescent in situ hybridization was performed for t(14;18) IGH/BCL2 and IGH rearrangement using a dual color fusion and a dual color break-apart probe, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one of the CD10-negative ENMZL cases were negative for both HGAL and LMO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One case originally classified as ENMZL was positive for both HGAL and LMO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fluorescent in situ hybridization did not detect either t(14;18) IGH/BCL2 or IGH rearrangement in this case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is likely, based on positivity of 2 established germinal center B-cell markers, that this represents a FL which was originally misclassified as an ENMZL based on CD10 negativity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the cases of FL (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CD10 and/or BCL-6 positive), 8 (80%) were positive for both HGAL and LMO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although HGAL and LMO2 did not demonstrate an increased sensitivity in the identification of FL of the nongastric GI tract in this series, they still were helpful in the reclassification of one of our cases, and may therefore be useful adjuncts in the identification of FL of the nongastric GI tract </plain></SENT>
