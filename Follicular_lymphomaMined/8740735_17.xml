<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the incidence of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) in Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino residents of the United States to obtain further clues about the etiology of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The age, race, and birthplace of residents of Hawaii, San Francisco/Oakland (California), and western Washington who had received a diagnosis of NHL during the period 1973-86 were obtained from population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries, and a special tabulation from the 1980 Census was used to estimate the number of person-years at risk for each category of resident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of NHL in each of the Asian groups examined was 35 to 85 percent that of US-born Whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there was no consistent trend of increasing incidence with increasing generation of residence in any of the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Asian-Americans, the risk of small cell lymphocytic and plasmacytoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was 10 to 85 percent that of Whites, although no clear trends of risk with generation of residence in the US were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They also were at a reduced risk of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and in Chinese and Japanese persons, the risk was lower in first generation than in later generation migrants (Chinese: Asian-born relative risk [RR] = 0.11, US-born, RR = 0.84; Japanese: Asian-born, RR = 0.15, US-born, RR = 0.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was similar in Chinese- and Japanese-Americans and US-born Whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, with the exception of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the basis for the relatively low incidence of NHL in Asian-Americans does not lie in exposures or characteristics that differ between the migrants themselves and their descendants </plain></SENT>
