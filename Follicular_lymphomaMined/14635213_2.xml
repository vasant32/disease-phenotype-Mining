<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was a 48-year-old Japanese man who was found, by colonoscopy, to have numerous small polypoid lesions along the entire large intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abdominal computed tomography revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo> and enlargement of multiple mesenteric lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the lesion was characterized by diffuse proliferation of small- to medium-sized lymphocytes with cleaved nuclei in the mucosa and submucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies showed that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were CD20+, CD10+, BCL-2+, CD5-, surface IgM-, and cyclin D1- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a cytogenetic study showed a translocation at (14;18)(q32;q21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, this case was diagnosed as diffuse FCL, although the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was mimicking mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
