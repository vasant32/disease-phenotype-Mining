<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic accuracy (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) for non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) by FNA was evaluated by review of 82 cases of histologically proved NHL after prior FNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHLs was 66% (54/82), and that for low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular small-cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and follicular mixed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, was 71% (12/17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> for FL was 69% (11/16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Review of individual surgical and cytologic materials from FLs revealed a tendency to show <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in the cytologically false-negative group and diffuse areas of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the true-positive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of "aggregation" of uniform lymphoid cells, probably due to cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> with the support of dendritic reticulum cells, was seen in 55% of true-positive FL (6/11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only 28% of true-positive diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (5/18) showed a mild degree of aggregation, and none of 7 cases of true-positive diffuse small-cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed this feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The aggregation of cells was not pathognomonic of FL, but its presence with a homogeneous cellular constituent and the paucity of tingible-body macrophages helped us to predict FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, it was a feature distinguishing FL from diffuse small-cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (P = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
