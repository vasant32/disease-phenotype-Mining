<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Fludarabine has been recognized as effective treatment in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), but can induce myelotoxicity of unknown mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Myelotoxicity was assessed by cultivation of two types of hematopoietic progenitor cells: colony-forming units granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment amounts of CFU-GM and LTC-IC were correlated to age, gender, stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005956" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disease, bone marrow</z:e> involvement, and previous therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Posttreatment comparison of CFU-GM and LTC-IC was performed after different regimens of chemotherapy: fludarabine-based (FND +/- R), procarbazine-based (COPP +/- R), and CHOP(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>) +/- R(Rituximab) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One-hundred patients (median age 55 years; 21 patients relapsed) treated for FL were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total number of progenitor hematopoietic cells in both types of cultures varied in wide ranges; for LTC-IC between 0 and 874 cells/mL with a median of 77.71 cells/mL and for CFU-GM between 0 and 531 x 10(2) cells/mL with a median of 30.58 x 10(2) cells/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow involvement, gender, stage of disease, or previous therapy had no influence on LTC-IC and CFU-GM counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We identified an increase in LTC-IC, but not CFU-GM, associated with age (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median figures for CFU-GM and LTC-IC were found to be significantly lower after FND +/- R and COPP +/- R than after CHOP +/- R therapy, compared to baseline values (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fludarabine and procarbazine have a dramatic influence, especially on the most immature hematopoietic cells, mirrored in reduced numbers of LTC-IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This finding is consistent with clinical observations (poor mobilization after fludarabine) and offers an insight into the mechanism of fludarabine-induced myelotoxicity </plain></SENT>
