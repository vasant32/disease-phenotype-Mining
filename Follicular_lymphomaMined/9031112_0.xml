<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We first demonstrated the 10(-5) Bcl2/JH PCR sensitivity with serial dilutions of OCY-LY8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mononuclear cells; and then the specificity and reproductibility of this technique by analysing follicular and non follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the Bcl2/JH PCR, we tested the efficiency of three marrow purging protocols with an experimentally contaminated bone marrow either treated by three anti-B cell monoclonal antibodies (mAb) followed by three rounds of rabbit complement or two rounds of immunomagnetics beads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Samples obtained after each purging were amplified by Bcl2/JH PCR and hybridized with PFL3 probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We were able to produce a 2 to 3 log <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell reduction after three rounds of complement and a 4 to 5 log reduction after two rounds of beads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study showed that it is feasible to use the Bcl2/JH PCR technique for residual cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> detection in patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy or BM transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that ex-vivo immunomagnetic BM purging is probably superior to complement mediated lysis for the eradication of B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells from the marrow of patients undergoing autologous transplantation </plain></SENT>
