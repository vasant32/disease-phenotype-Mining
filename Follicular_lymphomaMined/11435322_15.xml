<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Translocation between the BCL-2 and immunoglobulin heavy chain genes is detected in 85% to 90% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, BCL-2/J(H) translocation was detected in peripheral blood lymphocytes from more than 50% of healthy white individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To clarify the reason for the difference in incidence of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> between whites and Japanese, the frequency of BCL-2/J(H) translocation in peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy Japanese individuals was compared with that of German individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of BCL-2/J(H) translocation in Japanese adults appeared to be significantly lower than that in German adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present data suggest that the low frequency of BCL-2/J(H) translocation in the Japanese general population may be one of the major reasons for the difference in incidence of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> between whites and Japanese </plain></SENT>
