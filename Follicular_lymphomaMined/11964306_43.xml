<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>From 1992 to 2000, we identified 23 lymph node biopsies with focal germinal centers (GCs) containing centrocytes staining strongly for bcl-2 protein, whereas most of the remaining lymph node showed bcl-2-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We propose the designation in situ localization of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) for this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 2 additional cases, bcl-2(+) follicles with features of in situ FL were identified in association with other low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate the clonality of the bcl-2(+) follicles, we performed laser capture microdissection of bcl-2(+) and bcl-2 follicles from the same lymph node in 5 cases, and analyzed them in parallel by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 4 of 5 cases the bcl-2(+) follicles contained monoclonal IgH gene rearrangements, whereas the bcl-2(-) GCs exhibited a polyclonal ladder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A BCL2/JH gene rearrangement was detected in 6 of 14 (43%) evaluable cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 5 patients with synchronous evidence of FL at another site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 13 patients who, without a prior diagnosis of FL, had clinical follow-up; one developed FL in an adjacent lymph node within one year, and 2 manifested FL at 13 and 72 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There are 10 patients who have not yet shown other evidence of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that at least close to half of these cases (8/18; 44%) represent homing to and early colonization of reactive GCs by FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other cases might represent FL at the earliest stage of development, or a preneoplastic event, requiring a second hit for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings provide insight into the pathophysiology of early FL, and illustrate the utility of immunohistochemistry for early diagnosis </plain></SENT>
