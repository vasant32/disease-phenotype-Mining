<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Very few prognostic factors are known in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), a common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> of germinal centre (GC) B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) thus far appears to be the most important predictor of clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study explores the predictive power of the degree of GC differentiation for outcome in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Samples from 73 patients with FL were evaluated by immunohistochemistry for expression of GC markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Strong PU.1, CD20, and CD75 expression were significantly associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results for PFS were independent of the International Prognostic Index or the Italian <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Intergroup prognostic index for CD75 and PU.1, but only PU.1 expression was independent of FLIPI for PFS and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Oct-2 was weakly expressed overall, but more strongly in higher grades of FL; it had a trend for negative linear association with PU.1 and strong positive linear association with CD27, which possibly reflects its role in terminal B-cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We show that the level of GC differentiation, as determined by the levels of PU.1, CD75, CD20, Bcl-6, and CD10 expression, has an association with outcome in patients with FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While this is determined qualitatively in most studies of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, in FL there is a quantitative positive association between a high level of expression of GC antigens and longer OS and PFS even when data are stratified by the FLIPI score </plain></SENT>
