<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic abnormalities of the proto-oncogenes were detected in 7 of the 55 (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genetic abnormalities of bcl-2 plus other genes were detected in 5 of 7 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (71%), rearrangements of bcl-2 and c-myc, rearrangement of bcl-2 and amplification of c-myb </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of genetic abnormalities in diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (6.3%) was lower than that in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had double oncogene abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No abnormalities were found in RB-1, bcl-1, and Ha-ras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are associated with some abnormalities of oncogenes not restricted to bcl-2 that facilitate growth which may be associated with their clinical features </plain></SENT>
