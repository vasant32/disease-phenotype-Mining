<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation of p15 gene was associated with lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level (P = 0.020) and MGMT/DAPK comethylation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relapsed disease</z:e> (P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with FL, there was no significant difference in the overall survival between those with hypermethylated and unmethylated of any examined genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we analyzed methylation in the different groups according to FL International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the high-risk group, patients with hypermethylated p16 gene had significant lower overall survival than those with unmethylated p16 (P = 0.006) and trend toward shorter failure-free survival (P = 0.068) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the same risk group, there was a trend toward longer overall survival for patients with hypermethylated MGMT gene, compared to those with unmethylated MGMT gene (P = 0.066) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>p15 methylation had impact on shorter overall survival in grade I group of patients (P = 0.013), and DAPK methylation tended to have impact on shorter failure-free survival in the whole examined group (P = 0.079) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that promoter methylation of p16 and MGMT genes could have prognostic value when used in combination with the FLIPI and p15 methylation in combination with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concurrent methylation of MGMT and DAPK genes could be the marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> chemoresistance and disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
