<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Galiximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets CD80, a costimulatory molecule constitutively expressed on follicular and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Modest single-agent clinical activity and tolerability were demonstrated in a phase I study in relapsed or refractory, follicular non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A phase I/II study was conducted to evaluate galiximab in combination with a standard course of rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with follicular NHL who had relapsed or failed primary therapy were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rituximab-refractory patients (no response or a response with time to progression &lt;6 months) were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients received 4 weekly i.v. infusions of galiximab (125, 250, 375, or 500 mg/m(2)) and rituximab (375 mg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>International Workshop Response Criteria (IWRC) were used to evaluate response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-three patients received treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had received at least one prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> therapy; 40% were rituximab naive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Infusions were delivered in an outpatient setting and were well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most common study-related adverse events (AE) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, and chills </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate at the recommended phase II dose of galiximab (500 mg/m(2)) was 66%: 19% complete response, 14% unconfirmed complete response, and 33% partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The median progression free survival was 12.1 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy did not appear to alter pharmacokinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results indicate that galiximab can be safely combined with a standard course of rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This doublet biologic approach offers the potential to avoid or delay chemotherapy or to integrate with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A phase III, randomized study evaluating clinical benefit of rituximab versus the combination has been initiated </plain></SENT>
