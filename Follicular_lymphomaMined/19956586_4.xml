<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endogenous female sex hormones may modify immune function and influence NHL risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Few studies have examined associations between reproductive factors, which can serve as surrogates for such hormonal exposures, and NHL risk by subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Women in the California Teachers Study cohort provided detailed data in 1995-1996 on reproductive history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up through 2007 identified 574 women with incident B-cell NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hazard rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models to assess associations between reproductive factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B-cell NHL combined, diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy was marginally associated with lower risk of B-cell NHL (RR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.68-1.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Much of the reduction in risk was observed after one full-term pregnancy relative to nulligravid women (RR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.54-1.06; P for trend &lt;0.01), particularly for diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (P for trend = 0.13), but not among women who had only incomplete pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age at first full-term pregnancy was marginally inversely associated with B-cell NHL risk overall (P for trend = 0.08) and for diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (P for trend = 0.056) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Breast feeding was not associated with B-cell NHL risk overall or by subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Full-term pregnancy and early age at first full-term pregnancy account for most of the observed reduction in B-cell NHL risk associated with gravidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy-related hormonal exposures, including prolonged and high-level exposure to <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> during a full-term pregnancy may inhibit development of B-cell NHL </plain></SENT>
