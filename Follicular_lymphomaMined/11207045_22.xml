<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells micro-dissected from paraffin- embedded tissue sections in 24 patients with FL and subsequent transformation to DLBL and 18 patients with de novo DLBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> DNA was compared to reference DNA using comparative genomic hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities common to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 groups were gains on chromosomes 4q, 5q, 7q, 11q and X and losses on 3p, 8p and 10q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Copy number changes seen in both transformed and de novo DLBL and not seen in FL were gains on 2p and losses on 1q, 15q and Xq </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gains on 2q, 6p, 7p and 17q and losses on 5p and 8q were specific to transformed DLBL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gain on 12q12-14 was found in 52% of the transformed DLBL cases and was never seen in its follicular counterpart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patterns of genomic copy number change associated with specific clinical events in NHL have been demonstrated and suggest that gains on 2q, 6p, 7p, 12q and 17q and losses on 5p and 8q may be important in the transformation from low to high-grade disease </plain></SENT>
