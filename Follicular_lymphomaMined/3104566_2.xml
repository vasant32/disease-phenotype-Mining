<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They occurred in 12 male and 8 female patients, with the age range of 11-80 years (median 51 years of age) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty percent of patients were stages IE and IIE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histologically, 15 cases (75%) were ordinary non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) with diffuse large cell type being the most common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining 5 cases, undefinable by classification scheme for ordinary NHL, were designated as malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_146,MPATH_652'>histiocytosis</z:mpath> of the oral cavity (3 cases) and peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (2 cases), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A follow-up study showed that the stage of diseage, histologic classification, and frequency of mitosis correlated well with survival </plain></SENT>
