<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> histological grading is used to predict clinical behavior and to stratify patients for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the reproducibility of histological grading is poor and the clinical significance of the difference between grade 1 and grade 2 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data on proliferation characteristics with respect to prognosis in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed the Proliferation Index in follicles, using Mib-1 immunohistochemical staining in lymph node biopsies from 51 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who were receiving uniform first-line treatment consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and interferon alpha2b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median Proliferation Index was 16.9 (range 3.1-49.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In grades 1 and 2 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=45) it was 16.1, compared to 24.2 in grade 3 (n=6; p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 71 months, patients with a Proliferation Index below the median had a significantly prolonged time to progression (median not reached vs. 15 months for those with a Proliferation Index above the median; p=0.0006) and improved overall survival (median not reached vs. 42 months, respectively; p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, the Proliferation Index retained its predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional prognostic information was especially provided in patients with a low International Prognostic Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histological grade did not predict outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The Proliferation Index is a biological marker that is strongly and independently predictive for outcome in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, as shown even in this relatively small series of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is easily applicable and reproducible and therefore superior to histological grading in identifying clinically aggressive follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, requiring other types of treatment </plain></SENT>
