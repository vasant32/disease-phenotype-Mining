<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective case series consisted of 41 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and gastrointestinal involvement who underwent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG-PET and endoscopic evaluations at ten different institutions between November 1996 and October 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data for endoscopic, radiological, and biological examinations performed were retrospectively reviewed from clinical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A semi-quantitative analysis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG uptake was performed for each involved area by calculating the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the positivity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG uptake in the gastrointestinal lesions analyzed, patients were subdivided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To identify potential predictive factors for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG positivity, these two groups were compared with respect to gender, age at diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, histopathological grade, pattern of follicular dendritic cells, mitotic rate, clinical stage, soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels detected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG-PET, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels, bone marrow involvement, detectability of gastrointestinal lesions by computed tomography (CT) scanning, and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> international prognostic index (FLIPI) risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Involvement of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, and rectum was identified in 1, 34, 6, 3, 2, 3, and 6 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient had esophageal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In total, 19/41 (46.3%) patients exhibited true-positive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG uptake in the lesions present in their gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, false-negative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG uptake was detected in 24 patients (58.5%), while false-positive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG uptake was detected in 5 patients (12.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the former case, 2/19 patients had both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG-positive lesions and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG-negative lesions in the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG avidity, the SUVmax value of the involved gastrointestinal tract ranged from 2.6 to 17.4 (median: 4.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG-negative (n = 22) and -positive (n = 19) groups, there were no differences in the male to female ratios (10/12 vs 4/15, P = 0.186), patient age (63.6 ± 2.4 years vs 60.1 ± 2.6 years, P = 0.323), presence of histopathological grade 1 vs 2 (20/2 and 17/2, P = 1.000), follicular dendritic cell pattern (duodenal/nodal: 13/5 vs 10/3, P = 1.000), mitotic rate (low/partly high, 14/1 vs 10/3, P = 0.311), clinical stage according to the Ann Arbor system (stages IE and IIE/other, 15/7 vs 15/4, P = 0.499), clinical stage according to the Lugano system (stages I and II-1/other, 14/8 vs 14/5, P = 0.489), soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels (495 ± 78 vs 402 ± 83, P = 0.884), LDH levels (188 ± 7 vs 183 ± 8, P = 0.749), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels (13.5 ± 0.3 vs 12.8 ± 0.4, P = 0.197), bone marrow involvement (positive/negative, 1/8 vs 1/10, P = 1.000), detectability by CT scanning (positive/negative, 1/16 vs 4/13, P = 0.335), and FLIPI risk (low risk/other, 16/6 vs 13/6, P = 0.763), respectively in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that it is not feasible to predict <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG-avidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG-PET scans represent a complementary modality for the detection of gastrointestinal involvements in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, and surveillance of the entire gastrointestinal tract by endoscopic examinations is required </plain></SENT>
