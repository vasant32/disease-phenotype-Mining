<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, rituximab has been used as monotherapy and in combination with various chemotherapy regimens in different treatment situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Routinely, rituximab is given intravenously, but other routes of administration have also been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we report a 64-yr-old woman who was previously treated with three different chemotherapy regimens for stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No sustained clinical and radiological response could be achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient's general status declined and she developed massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> as the dominant clinical problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Local, intraperitoneal administration of rituximab was initiated as an experimental treatment approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 11 doses of rituximab, the general status of the patient improved significantly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> resolved completely and computed tomography (CT) scans demonstrated a partial remission of intra-abdominal lymph nodes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we observed a regression of mediastinal lymph nodes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo> and centrocytes in peripheral blood as well as improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The response to the experimental treatment has maintained for more than 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, we observed a sustained local and systemic response to intraperitoneal administration of rituximab in a patient with heavily pretreated advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
