<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 12 patients gave positive results, they include 9 of the 15 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 3 of the 30 patients with diffuse B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results were negative in 5 patients with reactive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint was located within the major breakpoint region in 11 of the 12 patients, and the remaining patient had bcl-2 translocation in the minor cluster region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of the study show that bcl-2/JH fusion gene in non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is an important molecular biological marker and has a significant role in differentiating benign or malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, determination of clonality, predicting prognosis and in the discovery of minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
