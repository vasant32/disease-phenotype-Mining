<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to report the pharmacokinetic behavior of Rituximab in patients affected with different diseases and treated with different schedules of administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden was a common feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (N=48) included in our study, whereas the timing of Rituximab administration varied from weekly (groups 1, 2, 3) to monthly (group 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group 1 included patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated with 4 weekly doses of Rituximab after first-line chemotherapy with CHOP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the start of Rituximab, patients were in partial or complete clinical response but showed persistence of disease at molecular level (bcl-2-positive) in bone marrow and/or peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients in group 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> and Rituximab was given to act on B-cells, interfering with their production of autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> (group 3), Rituximab was given to kill progenitor B-cells of the small clone terminating in amyloid-producing plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In groups 2 and 3, the target of monoclonal antibody was a population of small B cells, which make an intrinsic feature of the diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group 4 included patients with relapsed or refractory follicular and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who underwent a salvage program of immunochemotherapy, purging in vivo and autotransplant: the first of the six planned doses of Rituximab was administered after a debulking phase with a third-generation regimen, such as VACOP-B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) developed and validated in our laboratory was used for the pharmacokinetic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rituximab disposition was characterized by a 2-exponential decay, with a long elimination half-life of approximately 3 weeks (range, 248-859 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The total systemic clearance ranged between 3.1 and 11.9 mL/hr/m </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After 4 weekly infusions, Rituximab concentration was approximately 2.5 microg/mL, which is approximately 85% of the steady-state level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Steady-state plasma concentrations of Rituximab were reached after 6 to 8 weekly infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The adopted pharmacokinetic model (2-compartment open model) seems to provide the best fit of Rituximab disposition both during and after treatment, even when different schedules of drug administration are used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Because several studies reported an association between response and serum Rituximab concentrations, a treatment based on a pharmacokinetic model may be useful for predicting the desired drug concentration </plain></SENT>
