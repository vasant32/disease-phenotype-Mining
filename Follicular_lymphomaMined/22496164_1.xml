<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, the landscape of single base mutations in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) was described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report the discovery of a gene fusion between TBL1XR1 and TP63, the only recurrent somatic novel gene fusion identified in our analysis of transcriptome data from 96 DLBCL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on this cohort and a further 157 DLBCL cases analyzed by FISH, the incidence in de novo germinal center B cell-like (GCB) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> is 5% (6 of 115) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fusion appears exclusive to GCB and was not seen in 138 non-GCB cases examined (P = .008, Fisher exact test) but was present at low incidence in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1 of 81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 cases identified, the 3' end of the fusion consists of exons 4 and onwards of TP63 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The recurrence, subtype enrichment, and the remarkably conserved nature of the TP63 portion of the fusion suggest an important functional role in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that harbor this event </plain></SENT>
