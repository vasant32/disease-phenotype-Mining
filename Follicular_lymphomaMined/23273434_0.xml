<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the optimal schedule of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> remains to be investigated in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a randomised phase II study where patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in relapse or refractory receive either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> 1.5 mg/m(2) biweekly on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of a 21-day cycle (arm A) or 1.6 mg/m(2) weekly on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of a 35-day cycle (arm B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An interim analysis was planned after 15 fully evaluable patients randomised in each treatment arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If only five subjects or fewer respond, the treatment arm was concluded to be ineffective and was closed to inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients were included in the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arm B was closed to inclusion after interim analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>15/50 patients (30%) in arm A and 8/37 patients (22%) in arm B achieved a response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median duration of response was 16 and 15 months for arms A and B, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most drug-related adverse events (AEs) (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> grades, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cycles) were mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates tolerability and durable clinical benefit of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> when given at 1.5 mg/m(2) biweekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite a higher response rate in the biweekly arm, no major difference in patient's outcome was observed between the two arms in the final analysis </plain></SENT>
