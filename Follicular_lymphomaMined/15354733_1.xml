<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Progression of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs) is often accompanied by a spectrum of histologic changes and an aggressive clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although molecular alterations have been implicated in this event, the underlying factors are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the expression of selected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes (P53 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> [RB]), oncogenes (MYC and BCL2), and a transferrin-receptor related protein (Trump) in sequential biopsies in 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients progressed from grade I or II FL to aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with diffuse <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, whereas 5 patients presented with diffuse aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and recurred with indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity for P53 correlated with higher histologic grade in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> progressing from indolent to aggressive; however, only 1 patient who presented with aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> demonstrated a P53 gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither P53 immunoreactivity nor genotypic alterations correlated with presentation with an aggressive histology and relapse with FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Growth fraction, as assessed by Ki-67 staining, and Trump expression correlated with histologic grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity for RB, BCL2, and MYC was seldom associated with progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight of 9 cases tested exhibited identical immunoglobulin heavy and light chain rearrangements or identical BCL2 gene rearrangements in the sequential <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that P53 and Trump protein expression and proliferation activity correlate with histologic grade, but not with recurrence or progression of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results further indicate that progression of FL to diffuse aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and presentation of an aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> followed by FL are clonally related </plain></SENT>
