<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>That the incidence of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the previously reported frequency of BCL2 translocation are lower in Asians than in Caucasians implies a different molecular pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study of BCL2 rearrangement will yield deeper insights into the pathogenesis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and into clinical applications of molecular diagnosis for Asian follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BCL2 /IgH translocation was analyzed in paraffin-embedded tissues from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the major breakpoint region (MBR), the intermediate cluster region (ICR), and the minor cluster region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with split-signal BCL2 probes was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PCR analysis revealed BCL2 rearrangement in 12 (23.5%) of 51 cases (10 MBR and 2 ICR breakpoints) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This frequency is lower than the frequencies reported from Western countries (40%-60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DNA sequencing of the breakpoints revealed nucleotide insertions suggesting V(D)J recombination-mediated mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, FISH analysis revealed 11 (84.6%) of 13 cases with positive signals for BCL2 translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that BCL2 translocation is essential for the pathogenesis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Thai patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the data demonstrate the low sensitivity of the PCR for diagnostic testing and suggest that split-signal FISH is the method of choice </plain></SENT>
