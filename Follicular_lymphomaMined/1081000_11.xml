<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cells of the lymphoreticular system are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> both morphologically and functionally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow derived (B) lymphocyte can be identified by the presence of easily detectable surface immunoglobulin and a receptor for antigen-antibody-complement (EAC) complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Monocytes and histiocytes also bear a receptor for EAC and in addition possess a receptor for cytophilic antibody detected with red cell--IgG complexes (IgGEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In man, thymus derived (T) lymphocytes form non-immune rosettes with sheep red blood cells (E) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have examined a number of malignant lymphoreticular populations for the presence of the EAC, EA, and E receptors on suspensions of cells and have adapted the technique to demonstrate the EAC and EA receptors on frozen tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rosetted malignant cells can also be cytologically examined on Millipore filters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The malignant cells both in section and suspension from the spleens and lymph nodes of 6 patients with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> bound EAC but not IgGEA or E; by these criteria these malignant cells are of B lymphocytic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The malignant cells from the spleens of 2 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023443" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukaemic reticuloendotheliosis</z:e> and 1 patient with malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_146,MPATH_652'>histiocytosis</z:mpath> could be classified as being of histiocytic origin by the selective binding of IgGEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 3 cases of diffuse lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> the malignant cells bound only E and are therefore of T lymphocytic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The application of these techniques to the classification of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> may lead to important theoretical and therapeutic advances </plain></SENT>
