<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initial management strategies for FL have evolved to involve combination chemoimmunotherapy and/or radio-immunoconjugates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately even with the best available nontransplant treatment, which nowadays results in higher frequency of response, FL remains incurable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although considered a feasible therapeutic option, the use of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The appropriate timing, graft source, and intensity of HCT conditioning regimens in FL are often matters of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Herein we review the available published data pertaining to the use of autologous or allogeneic HCT in patients with FL across different stages of the disease, discuss major recent advances in the field, and highlight avenues for future research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The current literature does not support a role of HCT for FL in first remission, but in the relapsed setting autologous HCT remains appropriate for patients with early chemosensitive relapses, while allogeneic transplantation remains the sole curative modality for this disease, in relatively younger patients without significant comorbidities </plain></SENT>
