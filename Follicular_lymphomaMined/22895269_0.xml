<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe the pathologic features of 21 B-cell lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> that express CD3 protein by immunohistochemistry: 12 diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e>); 2 plasmablastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (PBLs); 4 plasma cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>; 2 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; and 1 nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, grade 3A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD20 expression was negative or only partially positive in 13/21 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus was positive in 3/20 tested cases (2 PBLs and 1 DLBCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> tested <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (14/14) had clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, and no clonal T-cell gene rearrangements were detected (0/14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 12 DLBCLs segregated into 2 main groups: 7 demonstrated features of plasmacytic differentiation but did not meet criteria for PBL, and 5 had anaplastic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, other features shared among the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> with plasmacytic differentiation, the plasma cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, and the PBLs included extranodal presentation, cytoplasmic localization of CD3, and lack of expression of other T-cell antigens in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> with anaplastic features and the single follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> coexpressed multiple T-cell antigens in a predominantly membranous pattern and presented with nodal disease in a relatively younger patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data expand the spectrum of morphologic, phenotypic, and clinical features of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> aberrantly expressing CD3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> often lack typical expression of B-cell antigens, knowledge of these features will help avoid misclassification </plain></SENT>
