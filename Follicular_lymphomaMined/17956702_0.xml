<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to enhance the understanding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> first diagnosed as follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical and laboratory characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> were analyzed and summarized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the findings of flow cytometry (FCM) and immunohistochemical staining technique were compatible with the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis can detect multiple types of chromosomal abnormalities, including t (11; 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> is a disease which diagnosis is difficulty confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization, multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization, FCM and immunohistochemical staining technique play important roles in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
