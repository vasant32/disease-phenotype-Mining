<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a prospective study, we evaluated the prognostic value of PET performed during treatment and at the end of treatment in 121 patients with FL treated with first-line immunochemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with previously untreated high-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden FL were treated with six cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>) plus two cycles of rituximab, without rituximab maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PET was performed before treatment, after four cycles of R-CHOP (interim PET), and at the end of treatment (final PET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PET scans were centrally reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total number of patients included was 121 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median age was 57 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After central review, interim PET (n = 111) was negative in 76% of patients, and final PET (n = 106) was negative in 78% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 23 months, 2-year progression-free survival rates were 86% for interim PET-negative versus 61% for interim PET-positive patients (P = .0046) and 87% for final PET-negative versus 51% for final PET-positive patients (P &lt; .001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two-year overall survival also significantly differed according to final PET results: 100% versus 88% (P = .0128) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PET performed either after four cycles of R-CHOP or at the end of therapy was strongly predictive of outcome in this prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic intervention based on PET results during or after inductive treatment should be evaluated </plain></SENT>
