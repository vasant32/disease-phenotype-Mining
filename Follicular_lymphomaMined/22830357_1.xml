<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor activity of miRNA-34a (miR-34a) by measuring cell proliferation of the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line DoHH2 transfected with this miRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report that miR-34a did not inhibit cell proliferation notwithstanding a marked down-regulation of c-MYC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, DoHH2 transfected cells showed a significant p53 down-regulation, suggesting that c-MYC positively controls p53 and the failed inhibition of cell proliferation is probably due to the down-regulation of the c-MYC/p53 axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In keeping with this, c-MYC silencing also down-regulated p53 and had no effect on cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In accordance with this hypothesis, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46742">nutlin-3</z:chebi> treatment or a small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) against BCL6 (B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 6) inhibited the proliferation of DoHH2 cells by up-regulating p53 without affecting either miR-34a or c-MYC levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the proliferation is controlled by the regulatory axis c-MYC/p53 and suggest that paradoxically miR-34a behaves as a pro-proliferative rather than an anti-proliferative miRNA in DoHH2 cells </plain></SENT>
