<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate FcRL1 as an immunotherapy target for B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, we prepared anti-FCRL1 mAbs without cross-reactivity to other FCRL family proteins and analyzed FCRL1 protein expression on malignant cells from patients and on B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Frequent FCRL1 expression was observed by flow cytometry on 12 B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B-NHL) cell lines and many patient samples: 12 of 14 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), 7 of 7 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), 13 of 17 hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (HCL), and 2 of 3 mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two recombinant immunotoxins, E3(Fv)-PE38 and E9(Fv)-PE38, were constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both immunotoxins bound to FCRL1-positive cells with similar affinities (3.4 and 3.2 nM) and were cytotoxic to cell lines, but E9(Fv)-PE38 was 4- to 20-fold more cytotoxic than E3(Fv)-PE38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concentrations that inhibited response by 50% (IC(50)s) of E9(Fv)-PE38 on 11 different FCRL1-positive cell lines ranged from 1.0 ng/mL to 90 ng/mL and correlated with the FCRL1 expression levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that anti-FCRL1 immunotoxin E9(Fv)-PE38 exhibits remarkably specific cytotoxicity and merits further evaluation for the treatment of FCRL1-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, including CLL, HCL, FL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, and other B-NHL </plain></SENT>
