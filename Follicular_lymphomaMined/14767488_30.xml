<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of Bcl-2 protein has been known to play a role in the pathogenesis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, 10-15% of FLs are negative for Bcl-2 by immunohistochemistry, raising the possibility that another gene product(s) may provide prosurvival signal(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used reverse phase protein microarray to analyze lysates of follicle center cells isolated by laser capture microdissection from: Bcl-2+ FL, Bcl-2- FL and reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> (FH) (nine cases each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TUNEL assay confirmed similar and reduced levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Bcl-2+ FL and Bcl-2- FL, indicating the likelihood of Bcl-2-independent inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arrays were quantitatively analyzed with antibodies to proteins involved in the apoptotic pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As expected, Bcl-2 levels were up to eight-fold higher in Bcl-2+ FL than in FH and Bcl-2- FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there was no difference in levels of Mcl-1 and survivin among these three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bcl-X(L) showed a trend for increased expression in Bcl-2- FL as compared with Bcl-2+ FL, although the differences did not reach statistical significance (P&gt;0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increase in Bcl-X(L) may provide an alternative antiapoptotic signal in FL negative for Bcl-2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Bax expression was higher in FL (Bcl-2+ or -) than in FH (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Notably, phospho-Akt (Ser-473) was increased in FL (Bcl-2+ or -) (P&lt;0.03) with increased phospho-Bad (Ser-136), as compared with levels in FH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The activation of the Akt/Bad pathway provides further evidence of prosurvival signals in FL, independent of Bcl-2 alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that nodal FL represents a single disease with a final common biochemical pathway </plain></SENT>
