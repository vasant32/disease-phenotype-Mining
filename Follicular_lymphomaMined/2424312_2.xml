<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six reactive lymph nodes and 5 malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> from homosexual males were studied by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51739">acridine orange</z:chebi> flow cytometry (AO-FCM) for determination of ploidy, proliferation, and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two reactive lymph nodes showed ploidy abnormalities as compared with none of 27 reactive lymph nodes from nonhomosexual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The homosexual-associated (HA) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> had a higher mean proliferative activity (11.2% versus 5.6%) and higher <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>) content (1.11 versus 0.96) than non-HA counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proliferative activity of HA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> was also higher than follicular small cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and not dissimilar to that of follicular large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that HA-reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> is a hyperproliferative state associated with high cellular <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> content and rare DNA-abnormal stemlines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One HA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had an abnormal stemline by AO-FCM, compared with 9 of 15 (63%) non-HA high grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> also demonstrated an abnormal karyotype (47,XY, +12, t[8;22]) by classic cytogenetic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean proliferative activity and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> content of HA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was higher than non-HA counterparts (37% versus 22.5% and 2.48 versus 1.73, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proliferation and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> features of HA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were on higher planes than non-HA lesions histologically comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, in addition to differences in clinical presentation, histologic subtype, stage distribution, and therapeutic response, HA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> have DNA/<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> characteristics different from those of counterparts in the general population </plain></SENT>
