<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) is a modulator of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> receptor-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and plays a major role in T- and B-cell homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three different isoforms have been described on the protein level, including the long form c-FLIP(L) as well as 2 short forms, c-FLIP(S) and the recently identified c-FLIP(R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms controlling c-FLIP isoform production are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we identified by sequence comparison in several mammals that c-FLIP(R) and not the widely studied c-FLIP(S) is the evolutionary ancestral short c-FLIP protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, the decision for production of either c-FLIP(S) or c-FLIP(R) in humans is defined by a single nucleotide polymorphism in a 3' splice site of the c-FLIP gene (rs10190751A/G) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas an intact splice site directs production of c-FLIP(S), the splice-dead variant causes production of c-FLIP(R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, due to differences in protein translation rates, higher amounts of c-FLIP(S) protein compared with c-FLIP(R) are produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Investigation of diverse human cell lines points to an increased frequency of c-FLIP(R) in transformed B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A comparison of 183 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 233 population controls revealed an increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> risk associated with the rs10190751 A genotype causing c-FLIP(R) expression </plain></SENT>
