<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, an increasing number of clinical studies have suggested that RIT may be more efficacious in an earlier phase of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a consensus meeting was held in May 2005 to define the optimal setting of RIT in the therapeutic algorithm of patients with advanced stage of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RIT is an established therapeutic option in relapsed FL </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>First-line RIT may be applied in patients not appropriate for chemotherapy induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Current study concepts evaluate the role of RIT consolidation in combination with antibody maintenance to achieve a potentially curative approach even in patients with advanced stage disease </plain></SENT>
