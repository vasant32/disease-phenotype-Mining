<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term results of high-dose therapy (HDT) in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, with specific emphasis on the prognostic significance of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-detectable Bcl-2/IgH rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1985 and October 1995, 99 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> received HDT as consolidation of second or subsequent remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow was treated in vitro with anti-B-cell antibodies and complement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-five patients remained alive, 49 treatment-failure free, with a median follow-up of 5.5 years (range, 1.5 to 12.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four "early" and 10 "late" <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred from treatment-related causes; seven of the latter were due to secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (s-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) or secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, 12 (12%) of the 99 patients developed s-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier estimates of freedom from recurrence (FFR) and survival rates at 5 years were 63% (95% confidence interval [CI], 52% to 72%) and 69% (95% CI, 58% to 78%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 99 patients, in multivariate analysis, absence of the Bcl-2/IgH rearrangement at the time of diagnosis (hazards ratio [HR], 0.39; P =.04) and three or fewer treatment episodes before HDT (HR, 0.03; P =.001) were significant prognostic factors for improved survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For patients bearing Bcl-2/IgH rearrangements, in univariate and multivariate analyses, absence of a PCR-detectable Bcl-2/IgH rearrangement during follow-up was associated with a significantly lower risk of recurrence (adjusted HR, 0.13; P &lt;.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (HR, 0.25; P =.02), whereas the PCR status of the reinfused bone marrow did not correlate with outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prolonged FFR can be achieved in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> after HDT, but as yet there is no survival advantage compared with conventional treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that elimination of cells bearing the Bcl-2/IgH rearrangement is highly desirable and should be attempted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of s-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is of increasing concern in this setting </plain></SENT>
