<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BCL2 transgenic mice develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at low frequency, hindering studies of <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and its inhibition in the presence of such gene products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MCL1 is a member of the BCL2 family that is highly regulated endogenously and that promotes cell viability and immortalization when introduced exogenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice expressing an MCL1 transgene in hematolymphoid tissues have now been monitored for an extended period and were found to develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with long latency and at high probability (more than 85% over 2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In most cases, the disease was widely disseminated and of clonal B-cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A variety of histologic subtypes were seen, prominently follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MCL1 thus sets the stage for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> as does BCL2, disease occurring with high probability and recapitulating a spectrum of subtypes as seen in human patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings with the transgene underscore the importance of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, highly regulated pattern of MCL1 expression, in addition to providing a model for studying <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and its inhibition in the presence of a viability promoting BCL2 family member </plain></SENT>
