<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the role of such cells detectable by immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray, focusing on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These cells physiologically produce interferon-Î±, which has been used in the therapy of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High numbers of pDCs are associated with increased survival, and so are high numbers of CD3+ T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The regular distribution of pDCs within T cell areas is reflected by a weak but significant correlation between pDCs and T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in multivariate Cox models, CD123 proved to be an independent prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings support the hypothesis of an association of pDCs with better prognosis by producing interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, due to a linear relationship between pDCs and survival shown by means of Kaplan-Meier plots, immunohistochemical staining of CD123 could serve as a prognostic tool for patients with FL </plain></SENT>
