<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of TP53 mutation in transformation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) to diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (t-FL) was examined in a panel of 91 lymph node biopsies derived from 29 patients pre- and post-transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The entire TP53 coding sequence was screened and immunocytochemistry performed to determine expression of p53 and its key regulator MDM2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 10 mutations were detected in eight patients (28%), although none were present at FL diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations were not detected solely at the time of transformation; in three patients, mutated TP53 arose in at least one antecedent FL sample (6 months, 2.5 years and 4 years prior to transformation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Loss of heterozygosity at the TP53 locus occurred in 2/20 informative patients (only in t-FL samples) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>p53 staining was positive in 82% (9/11) of available biopsies with a missense mutation, and negative in 71% (45/63) with wtTP53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MDM2 expression was significantly higher in t-FL samples (mean 72% positive; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 68-76%) than FL (mean 58% positive; 95% CI 54-62%) (P&lt;0.001) but did not correlate with TP53 status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TP53 mutation has only a limited role in the transformation of FL, exerting a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> influence upon phenotypic change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, dysregulation of MDM2 is frequent and may provide a more rational therapeutic target. </plain></SENT>
