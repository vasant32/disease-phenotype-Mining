<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conventional cytogenetic analysis showed at diagnosis complex chromosomal abnormalities in 13 cases and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, neither t(8;14)(q24;q32) nor the variants t(2;8)(p12;q24) or t(8;22)(q24;q11) was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FISH studies showed c-MYC amplification in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with four to more than seven copies in 10 - 77% metaphase or inter-phase cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study did not observe any gene fusion signal for c-MYC/IgH excluding a t(8;14) translocation and partial tri or polysomy of chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It also excluded in that cases a break apart for the c-MYC locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study also never detected IgL/c-MYC, IgK/c-MYC or X-c-MYC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The BLCs were present whatever the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> sub-type: follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) was diagnosed in six out of 16 patients, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) in four out of 16 patients, marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>) in two out of 16 patients and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) in three out of 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One additional patient presented a T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinical course was aggressive with a poor prognosis, as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in nine patients, within 6 months after diagnosis for eight of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data could suggest a sub-group of NHL patients (15 B-NHL, 1 T-NHL) have been identified with a poor prognosis characterized by the association of Burkitt-like cells and c-MYC amplification without t(8;14)(q24;q32) or its variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The possibility that this profile may represent a distinct morphologic NHL sub-set remains to be determined on a large cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
