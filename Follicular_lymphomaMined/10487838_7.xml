<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the Ca(2+)-capture ability of follicular dendritic cells (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi>) in tonsillar secondary lymphoid follicles (LFs) and the expression of six Ca(2+)-binding proteins (CBPs), caldesmon, S-100 protein, calcineurin, calbindin-D, calmodulin, and annexin VI in LFs of various lymphoid tissues and caldesmon and S-100 protein in neoplastic follicles of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>First, Ca(2+)-capture cytochemistry revealed extensive Ca(2+) capture in the nuclei and cytoplasm of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi>, but little or none in follicular lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> six CBPs were localized immunohistochemically in the LFs and were always present in the basal light zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoelectron microscopic staining of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> was classified into two patterns: caldesmon was distributed in the peripheral cytoplasm like a belt; S-100 protein, calcineurin, calbindin-D, and calmodulin were distributed diffusely in the cytosol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Annexin VI was, however, negative on <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemistry also demonstrated CBP-positive <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> within <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi>-associated clusters isolated from germinal centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization revealed diffuse calmodulin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression throughout the secondary LFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the CBPs examined may regulate Ca(2+) in the different subcellular sites of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi>, and the roles of CBPs may be <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the distribution of caldesmon and S-100 protein in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> on paraffin-embedded tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> within grades I and II neoplastic follicles clearly expressed caldesmon, but not S-100 protein, except a part of grade II neoplastic follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> within grade III follicles showed no caldesmon, but frequently expressed S-100 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that the caldesmon and S-100 protein staining patterns of grade I follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are different from those of grade III follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and suggest that <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> networks in grade I neoplastic follicles may be similar to those in the light zone within non-neoplastic follicles, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> networks in grade III neoplastic follicles may be similar to those in dark and basal light zones within non-neoplastic follicles, and grade II follicles may be intermediate between grade I and grade III follicles </plain></SENT>
