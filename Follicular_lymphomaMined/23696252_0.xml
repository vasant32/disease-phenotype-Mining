<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD22 has emerged as an ideal target for monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based therapy of B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> including most <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and many <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epratuzumab, an anti-CD22 mAb, has been developed in various forms, including as an unlabeled (naked) mAb, as a radioimmunotherapeutic, as an antibody drug conjugate (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>), and as a vehicle for CD22-targeted nanoparticles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While clinical trials with unlabeled epratuzumab have demonstrated modest results, its combination with rituximab in phase II studies has been more encouraging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the potential for CD22 to become internalized, CD22-targeted constructs carrying radioisotopes or toxins have generated promising results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Radioimmunotherapy, utilizing (90)Y-labeled epratuzumab, was shown to be highly effective in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, generating a complete response (CR) rate of 92 % and progression-free survival of more than 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> therapy is a promising therapeutic approach to B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> which includes the direct conjugation of mAbs with cytotoxic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Phase II studies of inotuzumab ozogamicin, an <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> which combines anti-CD22 mAb with calicheamicin, an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53268">enediyne antibiotic</z:chebi> which mediates <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> have produced an overall response rate (ORR) of greater than 50 % in treatment-refractory patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Phase I trials of moxetumomab pasudotox, an <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> which combines anti-CD22 with PE38, a fragment of Pseudomonas exotoxin A, have been completed in hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> with a ORR of 86 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, a review of CD22-targeted nanoparticles, that include a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-containing <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> complex that uses synthetic high-affinity CD22 ligand mimetics as well as anti-CD22 mAb-coated pegylated liposomas doxorubin (PLD), has demonstrated promising results in pre-clinical models of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, novel anti-CD22 mAb that block CD22 ligand binding as well as second generation <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> that utilize biodegradable linkers and more potent toxins hold great hope for the future of CD22-targeted therapeutics that may translate into better outcomes for patients with CD22-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
