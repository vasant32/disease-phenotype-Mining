<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 87%: 46 patients achieved complete response (CR) (77%), 6 a partial response (10%) and 8 were non-responders </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 4-year estimated probability of overall survival and failure-free survival were 78.2% and 45% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients (58%) are still in CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixty percent of patients experienced grade III-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
