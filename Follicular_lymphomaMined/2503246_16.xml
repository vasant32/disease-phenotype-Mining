<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fourteen cases of primary cutaneous B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were investigated at the immunohistochemical and molecular level to further characterize this newly defined entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neoplastic cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, phenotyped with a panel of monoclonal antibodies, were positive for HLA-DR, for the B-cell markers CD19, CD22, but not CD23 (except one case), and negative for the T-cell marker CD2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains were demonstrated in six cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reactivity with the Ki-67 monoclonal antibody indicated that the neoplastic cells are proliferating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In five biopsies the presence of dendritic cells infiltrating the neoplastic areas was revealed using the monoclonal antibody Kim4b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By Southern blot analysis, clonal rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (involving one or both alleles) was shown in 12 of 14 cases and of the light chain genes in 13 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2 oncogene, normally involved in nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, was in germ-line configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The c-myc and the beta and gamma chain genes of the T-cell receptor were also in the germ-line configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the cases presented Epstein-Barr virus sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that primary cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of B-cell origin share morphological and phenotypic similarities with the nodal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of follicular histotype, are proliferating, and express in 45% of cases clear monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain; the molecular analysis confirms the B-cell derivation and the monoclonal nature of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>; it also shows that neither bcl-2 nor c-myc oncogenes are involved and that no inappropriate rearrangements of the T-cell receptor genes are found in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
