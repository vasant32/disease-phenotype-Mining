<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The incidence of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) has increased worldwide in recent decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diet could influence NHL risk by modulating the immune system, although evidence is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We did a population-based case-control study to determine whether differences in diet were associated with NHL risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 597 NHL cases and 467 population controls in Sweden completed a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire evaluating their dietary habits 2 years before the interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for associations between food intake and risk of NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High consumption of dairy products and fried red meat was associated with increased risk of NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The OR of NHL for individuals in the highest quartile compared with the lowest quartile of dairy intake was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.1-2.2; P(trend) = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The OR for the highest versus lowest quartile of fried red meat intake was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.0-2.1; P(trend) = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, high consumption of fruits and vegetables was associated with reduced risk of NHL, particularly follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, among women but not men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with the lowest quartile of vegetable intake, the OR of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> among women in the highest quartile of vegetable intake was 0.3 (95% CI, 0.1-0.7; P(trend) = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The positive associations of NHL risk with dairy products and fried red meat and the inverse association with fruits and vegetables suggest that diet affects NHL risk and could explain the increase of some histopathogic subtypes </plain></SENT>
