<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most common chromosomal abnormality in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is the reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 14 and 18 (t(14;18)), which occurs in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The break at the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus on chromosome 14 is an interruption of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> V(D)J recombination process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>But the breakage on chromosome 18, at the Bcl-2 gene, occurs within a confined 150-base-pair region (the major breakpoint region or Mbr) for reasons that have remained enigmatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have reproduced key features of the translocation process on an episome that propagates in human cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The RAG complex--which is the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> enzyme for DNA cleavage at V, D or J segments--nicks the Bcl-2 Mbr in vitro and in vivo in a manner that reflects the pattern of the chromosomal translocations; however, the Mbr is not a V(D)J recombination signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rather the Bcl-2 Mbr assumes a non-B-form DNA structure within the chromosomes of human cells at 20-30% of alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Purified DNA assuming this structure contains stable regions of single-strandedness, which correspond well to the translocation regions in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hence, a stable non-B-DNA structure in the human genome appears to be the basis for the fragility of the Bcl-2 Mbr, and the RAG complex is able to cleave this structure </plain></SENT>
