<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: MicroRNA profiles of enriched follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells from 16 patients were generated by assaying 851 human microRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tandem gene expression profiles were obtained for predicting microRNA targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression of 133 microRNAs was significantly different (&gt; 2-fold; P&lt;0.05) between follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-four microRNAs in three groups generated a unique follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> signature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, ten microRNAs were increased (miR-193a-5p, -193b*, -345, -513b, -574-3p, -584, -663, -1287, -1295, and -1471), 11 microRNAs were decreased (miR-17*, -30a, -33a, -106a*, -141, -202, -205, -222, -301b, -431*, and -570), and 23 microRNAs formed a group that was increased in most cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but showed lower expression in a subset of cases (let-7a, let-7f, miR-7-1*, -9, -9*, -20a, -20b, -30b, -96, -98, -194, -195, -221*, -374a, -374b, -451, -454, -502-3p, -532-3p, -664*, -1274a, -1274b, and -1260) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher expression of this last group was associated with improved response to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gene expression analysis revealed increased expression of MAPK1, AKT1, PRKCE, IL4R and DROSHA and decreased expression of CDKN1A/p21, SOCS2, CHEK1, RAD51, KLF4, BLIMP1 and IRF4 in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Functional studies indicated that CDKN1A/p21 and SOCS2 expression is directly regulated by miR-20a/-20b and miR-194, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is characterized by a unique microRNA signature, containing a subset of microRNAs whose expression correlate with response to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>miR-20a/b and miR-194 target CDKN1A and SOCS2 in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, potentially contributing to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell proliferation and survival </plain></SENT>
