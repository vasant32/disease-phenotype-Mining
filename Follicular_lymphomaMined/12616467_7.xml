<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) inhibits mature B-cell proliferation and immunoglobulin production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased levels of serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are associated with poor prognosis in non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To understand the expression of angiogenic cytokines at different stages of B-cell differentiation in lymph nodes, we examined the immunohistochemical expression of TGF-beta, VEGF, bFGF, and their receptors in five patients with reactive benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> and 12 patients with B-cell NHL (mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 4; small cleaved cell follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 5; lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In benign lymph nodes, TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, and TGFbetaRII were positive in prefollicular mantle cells, follicular center cells, and postfollicular plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Basic FGF, FGF-R1, and FGF-R4 were positive in large follicular center cells and postfollicular plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor was positive in large follicular center cells and postfollicular plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In NHL, TGF-beta and its receptors were weakly positive in small cleaved cell follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; VEGF was strongly positive in lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and weakly positive in mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Basic FGF and its receptors were negative in NHL; however, FGF-R4 was positive in some cases of small cleaved cell follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that TGF-beta, bFGF, and their receptors have opposite roles in B-cell differentiation and maturation in benign lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transforming growth factor-beta and its receptors have an important role in germinal center development; loss of their activity could be associated with abnormal clonal proliferation of NHL </plain></SENT>
