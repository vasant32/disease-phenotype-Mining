<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical features of reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> with giant follicles (RHGF) among Japanese, 14 patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects consisted of 9 males and 5 females, ranging in age from 9 to 61 years, with a mean age of 30 years and a median age of 24 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of the patients exhibited systemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The affected lymph nodes were located in the head and neck area except in 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the time of lymph node biopsy, 1 patient was diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> (IM) and 2 patients had a recent history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> IM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One each with myelogenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had a history of peripheral blood stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no recurrences during follow-up periods ranging from 3 to 50 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histologically, 14 lesions were characterized by numerous enlarged, coalescing lymphoid follicles with distortion rather than effacement of the lymph node architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By in situ hybridization, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes were demonstrated in 5 (36%) of 14 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study indicates that a portion of RHGF appears to represent a histologic finding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> IM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, as previously stated, RHGF should be differentiated from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, particularly the floral variant </plain></SENT>
