<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the case of a young woman with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with multiple nodular lesions involving segments of the proximal jejunum and terminal ileum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presenting symptom was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002028'>chronic diarrhea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was made by endoscopy with histologic examination of the mucosal lesions of the proximal and distal small intestine, immunohistochemical staining, and molecular analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The initial spread and pattern of the small bowel involvement, as well as treatment response, were evaluated by videocapsule endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The application of molecular analysis along with immunophenotypic evaluation has made it possible to precisely diagnose follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the present case, the use of capsule endoscopy improved the evaluation of the extent of small bowel involvement prior to and following treatment </plain></SENT>
