<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The chromosome translocation, t(14;18)(q32;q21), and its associated bcl-2 gene rearrangement are generally associated with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some investigators, however, proposed that the presence of the t(14;18) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> suggests a possible follicle center cell origin and might correlate with a higher relapse rate after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CD10 antigen is expressed in a majority of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> but is also seen occasionally in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined 26 DLBCLs for CD10 expression by flow cytometric analysis and tested them for the t(14;18)(q32;q21) major breakpoint region by a polymerase chain reaction-based method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>bcl-2 protein expression was analyzed by an immunoperoxidase method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 26 DLBCLs, 9 (35%) were CD10 positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>bcl-2 protein was expressed in 7 (78%) of 9 CD10-positive cases and in 9 (53%) of 17 CD10-negative cases (P = .4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The t(14; 18) translocation was present in 6 (67%) of 9 CD10-positive cases but in only 2 (17%) of 12 CD10-negative cases (P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five cases did not yield amplifiable DNA for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, no difference in bcl-2 protein expression was seen in CD10-positive versus CD10-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e>, but CD10-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> were significantly more likely than CD10-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> to harbor the t(14;18) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suggests that CD10 might be a marker of follicle center cell origin in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
