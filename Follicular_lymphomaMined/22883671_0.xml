<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical features, endoscopic findings, pathologic diagnosis and treatment options of intestinal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> first presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical features, pathologic findings and follow-up data were retrospectively studied in 9 cases of intestinal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study for CD3, CD5, CD20, CD21, Ki-67, bcl-2, bcl-6, CD10 and cyclin D1 was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven of the 9 patients were females and two were males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The age of patients ranged from 5 to 60 years (mean = 44 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestations included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> (5 cases), blood in stool (3 cases) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003270'>abdominal distension</z:hpo> (1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The commonest site of involvement was ileocecal region (6/9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic examination had been carried out in 6 patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed the presence of multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five cases had undergone endoscopic biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histologic examination of the endoscopic biopsies showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells located mainly in mucosal layer, forming vague nodules with ill-defined boundaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Plasma cells and eosinophils were not conspicuous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases diffusely expressed CD20, CD10 and bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The staining for CD3, CD5 and cyclin D1 was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Lymphoid cells with weak CD10-positivity were identified in the interfollicular regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Four cases were treated with surgical resection and chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The other 3 cases received chemotherapy only and the remaining cases were treated conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them were still alive on follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Primary intestinal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> affects predominantly elderly patients and has a female predilection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The commonest site of involvement is ileocecal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic examination shows polypoid changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The disease often runs a relatively indolent clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The prognosis is better than that of primary nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
