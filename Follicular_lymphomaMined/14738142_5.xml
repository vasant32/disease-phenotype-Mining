<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Italian <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> intergroup (ILI) promoted a retrospective study of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated in cooperative trials between 1985 and 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six hundred and thirty three cases were treated with an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-containing regimen and 128 patients were treated without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two groups were prognostically comparable; in particular, no difference was observed according to both IPI and ILI prognostic index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results showed a complete remission (CR) rate for patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> was 69.2% and overall response rate was 92.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 51 months (54 months for patients still alive), the 5- and 10-year overall survival (OS) rates were 80 and 66%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival (DFS) and failure-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e>) rates at 5 years were 61 and 49%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the group of patients treated with combination chemotherapy not including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi>, the CR rate was 67.5% and the overall response rate was 85.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A longer OS (80% at 5 years) was observed in patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> compared to 67% OS rate in patients treated without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> (p = 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> was significantly longer in patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> (49 vs. 34% p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> with low or intermediate risk according to ILI prognostic index showed a significantly longer OS (p = 0.0001 andp = 0.0009, respectively); those in the high-risk group showed a trend for a longer survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this retrospective study shows that patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated with an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> containing regimen had a better outcome compared to patients treated with other combination regimens non including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> in terms of CRs, OS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these results <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-containing regimens (ACR) should be considered as the standard treatment of patients with advanced follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
