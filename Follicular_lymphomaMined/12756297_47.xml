<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transformation to diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) is an important cause of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using cDNA microarray analysis we identified 113 transformation-associated genes whose expression differed consistently between serial clonally related samples of FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> occurring within the same individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative RT-PCR validated the microarray results and assigned blinded independent group of 20 FLs, 20 DLBCLs, and five transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell lines with 100%, 70%, and 100% accuracy, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Notably, growth factor cytokine receptors and p38beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were differentially expressed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry of another blinded set of samples demonstrated expression of phosphorylated p38MAPK in 6/6 DLBCLs and 1/5 FLs, but not in benign germinal centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SB203580 an inhibitor of p38MAPK specifically induced caspase-3-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in t(14;18)+/p38MAPK+-transformed FL-derived cell lines </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results implicate p38MAPK dysregulation in FL transformation and suggest that molecular targeting of specific elements within this pathway should be explored for transformed FL therapy </plain></SENT>
