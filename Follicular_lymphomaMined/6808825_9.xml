<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the immunoperoxidase technic, differential staining with antisera to the various heavy and light chain classes permitted detection and characterization of monotypic immunoglobulin in frozen sections of 15 of 15 nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 24 of 31 diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The immunoperoxidase technic applied to frozen sections is a convenient and reliable method for the detection of immunoglobulin in lymphoid tissues, which can be performed in a pathology laboratory without the need for special equipment </plain></SENT>
