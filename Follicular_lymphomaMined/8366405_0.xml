<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From 1968 to 1991, 74 patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> originating in the thyroid gland were treated at Noguchi Thyroid Clinic Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients consisted of 53 females and 21 males, with a median age of 64.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival curves were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and significance was tested by generalized Wilcoxon test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 81.8% and 62.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The survival rate in stage II disease was significantly (P = 0.004) lower than that in stage I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By the LSG classification, there was no significant difference in survival curves between follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using the Working Formulation, there was no significant difference in survival curves between cases with low and intermediate grade histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histologic subtype of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> did not appear to be a significant determinant of prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001605'>vocal cord paralysis</z:hpo> had poorer survival rates than others (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Extrathyroidal spread of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> by direct soft tissue invasion had a distinctly adverse effect on prognosis </plain></SENT>
