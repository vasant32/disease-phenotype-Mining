<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Surface markers were studied in a series of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with immunofluorescence on frozen sections (39 cases) and on cell suspensions (21 cases), and with immunoperoxidase on frozen sections using a panel of 15 monoclonal antibodies (17 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With immunofluorescence on frozen sections, 22/39 cases showed monotypic sIg (IgMK: 14 cases, IgML: 7 cases, M: 1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 17 cases the neoplastic follicles were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, even if sIg is not detected, the absence of an extracellular immunoglobulin network is indicative of the neoplastic, and not of the reactive nature of lymphoid follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results obtained with immunofluorescence on frozen sections and on cell suspensions were identical in about half of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 9/21 cases monotypic sIg were detected by only one of these two methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the 17 cases studied with immunoperoxidase on frozen sections using monoclonal antibodies demonstrated monotypic sIg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On low magnification 6/17 sIg+ exhibited a nodular staining pattern while 7/17 cases this staining was diffuse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 4/17 cases the staining pattern for heavy and light chains was different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A thin mantle zone, with sIgM plus sIgD cells, was observed in only 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anti-HLA-DR and Leu-10 were positive in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>T cells positive for OKT3 were mainly distributed in the interfollicular areas; OKT4+ cells outnumbered OKT8+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Within the neoplastic follicles, T cells stained mainly for OKT4 and OKT8+ cells were scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Leu-7+ cells predominated within the neoplastic nodules in 5 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>With the anti-dendritic reticulum cell monoclonal antibody, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 17 cases showed a network, usually more loosely arranged than in reactive follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In 4 cases, of follicular and diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, this network was extremely dissociated and in some areas these cells were scanty or lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We concluded that immunoperoxidase on frozen sections, using monoclonal antibodies, appears to be the most reliable method for the immunological phenotyping of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
