<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These were compared to the frequency of therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) during the same time period </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The t-ALL cases followed treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> (two cases), <z:mp ids='MP_0008714'>lung carcinoma</z:mp> (two cases), lymphocyte predominance <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with a latency period of 13 months to 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> t-ALL cases had a pro-B (CD10-negative) immunophenotype with significantly higher expression of CD15 and CD65, compared to the de novo CD10-positive ALL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> six t-ALL cases had MLL abnormalities by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and four showed t(4;11)(q21;q23) </plain></SENT>
