<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We here report two unusual cases of floral variant of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> containing marginal zone B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the neoplastic follicles consisted of three distinct layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The inner layer was composed of neoplastic germinal centers exhibiting a floral design and the middle layer had unusually prominent mantle zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The outer zone of neoplastic follicles was surrounded by a pale cuff of marginal zone B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistological study demonstrated that both the germinal center and marginal zone component lay within the follicular dendritic cell network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The germinal center component was CD10+ and bcl-2+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a portion of the marginal zone component weakly expressed bcl-2 but not CD10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nodal marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NMZBL) occasionally possesses "floral" lymphoid follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with marginal zone differentiation is a high-risk variant of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In diagnostic practice, the differential diagnosis between the floral variant of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> containing marginal zone B-cells and the "floral variant" of NMZBL is important </plain></SENT>
