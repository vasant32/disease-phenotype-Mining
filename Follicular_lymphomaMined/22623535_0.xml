<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to measure perfusion parameters, including transit constant (K(trans)), in untreated follicular and diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> using volume perfusion CT, to establish their discriminating role and to search for a possible histopathologic background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Between January 2010 and June 2011, 46 consecutive patients with untreated histologically confirmed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 16) or diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 30) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 40-second volume perfusion CT of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> bulk using 6.9-cm z-axis coverage and a total of 26 volume measurements was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), and K(trans) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> size was recorded as the product of long- and short-axis diameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 13 of 46 patients, pathologic specimens of an appropriate size were available for assessment of microvessel density (MVD) and microvascular <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter for comparison with volume perfusion CT measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean BF, BV, and K(trans) values were significantly higher in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> than in diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, even after controlling for patient age and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size (p &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although MVD was slightly, but not significantly, higher in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> versus diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (p &gt; 0.05), microvascular <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter was significantly larger in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> than in diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We defined cutoff values for BF, BV, and K(trans) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If the cutoff points are met for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three parameters, the overall accuracy for correctly identifying diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was 90.5% and 87.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Volume perfusion CT allows assessment of differences in vascularity of follicular and diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, reflecting vascular <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> variability and histopathologic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
