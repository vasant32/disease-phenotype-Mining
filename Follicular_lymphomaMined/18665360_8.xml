<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The introduction of rituximab into the primary treatment of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the B cell lineage has had a major impact on the management of these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, prolonged exposure to rituximab as maintenance therapy has been beneficial in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the individual patient, the effect of any prolonged antitumor therapy on the quality of life (QoL) is a very important question </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, so far, the question whether rituximab maintenance therapy may impair QoL in patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> remains unanswered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate this subject, we have performed a prospective randomized trial of rituximab maintenance therapy (8 cycles rituximab 375 mg/m(2) every 3 months) versus observation in patients with CD20+B cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Between July 2002 and December 2005, 122 patients were included into the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>QoL was assessed with the standardized questionnaires EORTC-QLQ-C30, EuroQol-5D, and EuroQol-5D (VAS) in 91 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After statistical analysis with the exact Wilcoxon rank sum test, we found no significant differences of the QoL between the rituximab treatment group and the observation group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that rituximab maintenance therapy seems to be safe and does not impair quality of life in this patient population </plain></SENT>
