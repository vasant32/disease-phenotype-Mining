<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was 9.1% in the 231 patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall survival rates at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years were 90.2%, 78.2%, and 52.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up of surviving patients and time to treatment failure (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi>) was 43 months and 30 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median time from disease progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 171 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, factors associated with poor survival were stage IV (Ann Arbor staging system), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level less than 10g/dl), bone marrow involvement, two or more extranodal sites, and failure in induction of complete remission (CR) in the entire course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with short <z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, bone marrow involvement, and failure in induction of CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, induction of CR affected survival and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi> independently </plain></SENT>
