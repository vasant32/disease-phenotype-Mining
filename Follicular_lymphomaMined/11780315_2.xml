<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and direct DNA sequencing were used to identify mutations in the 5' noncoding region of the BCL-6 gene in a total of 40 cases of diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine cases were found to have base substitutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of BCL-6 gene mutation and the frequency of single-base changes were approximately 25.7% and (0.56-1.10) x 10(-2)/bp, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The 5' regulatory region of the BCL-6 gene undergoes frequent somatic hypermutation during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> and the identification of BCL-6 gene hypermutations provides a molecular marker for confirmatory diagnosis of B-NHL </plain></SENT>
