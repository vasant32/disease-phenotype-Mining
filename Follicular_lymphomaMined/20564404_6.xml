<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The association between prediagnosis cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and body mass index (BMI) and overall survival was evaluated in 1286 patients enrolled through population-based registries in the United States from 1998 through 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using Cox regression, adjusting for clinical and demographic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Through 2007, 442 patients had died (34%), and the median follow-up for surviving patients was 7.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with never smokers, former (HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.12-2.26) and current (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.97-2.29) smokers had poorer survival, and poorer survival was found to be positively associated with smoking duration, number of cigarettes smoked per day, pack-years of smoking, and shorter time since quitting (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Alcohol use was associated with poorer survival (P = 0.03); compared with nonusers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those drinking &gt;43.1 g/week (median intake among drinkers) had poorer survival (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.06-2.27), whereas those drinkers consuming less than this amount demonstrated no survival disadvantage (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.75-1.71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Greater BMI was associated with poorer survival (P = 0.046), but the survival disadvantage was only noted among <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals (HR, 1.32 for BMI &gt; or = 30 vs BMI 20-24.9; 95% CI, 1.02-1.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results held for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-specific survival and were broadly similar for diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NHL patients who smoked, consumed alcohol, or were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> before diagnosis were found to have a poorer overall and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-specific survival </plain></SENT>
