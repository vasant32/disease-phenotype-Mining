<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE First-line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) still remains debated, even in the rituximab-based combination therapy era </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few studies have addressed the question whether complete remission (CR) translates into better survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the long-term follow-up of prospectively treated patients with FL and the potential correlation between response quality to first-line treatment and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS Data from 536 patients with FL with low (n = 193) or high (n = 343) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden enrolled from October 1986 to May 1995 in the French and Belgian GELF86 studies were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data from these trials have been previously reported for low-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden and high-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results Median follow-up was 14.9 years, and median OS was 9.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treated patients who achieved a complete response (CR; n = 194; 45%) had a significant longer OS than those only reaching a partial response (PR; n = 168; 39%) throughout treatment (hazard ratio [HR], 0.55; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.72; P &lt; .001) in an univariate time-dependent Cox model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar findings were found when response to treatment (CR v PR) was adjusted for potentially confounding factors in a multivariate model (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.73; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION These data provide a long follow-up of these patients' cohorts and indicate that a better response to first-line treatment translates into an improved survival for patients with FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, response-adapted therapy aiming to achieve a CR should be considered as first-line treatment </plain></SENT>
