<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Centers for Disease Control Selected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancers</z:e> Study, a population-based case-control study of several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, included a large number of cases of NHL and a pathology review, providing a rare opportunity to study risk factors for groups of NHL subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the relation between occupational exposures and three subgroups of NHL: small cell diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (N = 185), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (N = 268), and large cell diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (N = 526) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 1,659 controls available for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After controlling for demographic variables and previously identified risk factors for NHL, we observed two interesting associations, one between solvent exposure and small cell diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> [odds ratio (OR) = 1.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10-2.20], and the other between meat packaging/processing and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (OR = 1.60; 95% CI = 0.99-2.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of this exploratory analysis are primarily negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our lack of positive findings may indicate that the subgroups of NHL used may not be etiologically distinct and that further work needs to be done to develop an NHL classification system that is etiologically informative and useful for epidemiologic studies </plain></SENT>
