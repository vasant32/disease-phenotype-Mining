<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> Group B (CALGB) compared two contrasting approaches: a single agent, and combination chemotherapy capable of curing diffuse aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 228 patients with stage III or IV FSCL or FML were randomized to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> or the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> (CHOP-B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment was continued in responders for 2 years beyond maximal response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was survival in the most common subtype, FSCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-one percent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients responded; complete responses were seen in 66% of those treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and in 60% treated with CHOP-B (P =.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 10 years with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> or CHOP-B, respectively, overall time to failure (25% failure free v 33%; P =.107) and survival (44% alive v 46%; P =.79) were similar by treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Outcomes in FSCL also were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 46 patients with FML, at 10 years the combination was associated with better failure-free (9% v 48%; P =.005) and overall (25% v 61%; P =.024) survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> toxic effects were more common with combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Second malignancies</z:e>, which might be attributed to treatment, were seen with both approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is no advantage to the initial use of the relatively intensive combination, CHOP-B, for patients with FSCL compared with the less toxic single agent, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, in an unplanned subgroup analysis, patients with FML who received the combination experienced improved disease control and survival </plain></SENT>
