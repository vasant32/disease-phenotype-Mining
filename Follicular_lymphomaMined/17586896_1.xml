<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Specific chromosomal translocations are often found to be associated with distinct types of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18) is considered to be a cytogenetic hallmark of the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> found mostly in American patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This chromosomal translocation occurs through a 3' untranslated region (either major breakpoint region [mbr] or minor cluster region [mcr]) of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene in chromosome 18 and the JH region of the immunoglobulin (Ig) gene in chromosome 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect a fusion DNA fragment generated from bcl-2/JH rearrangement either through mbr or mcr in 10 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in Saudi Arab patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, none of these cases showed any evidence of bcl-2 gene rearrangement through mbr or mcr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The absence of usual bcl-2/JH recombination in Saudi follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is intriguing and may suggest that the occurrence and mode of bcl-2 gene rearrangement in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> varies in different patient populations </plain></SENT>
