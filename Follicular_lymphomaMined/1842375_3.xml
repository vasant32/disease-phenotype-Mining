<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHLs) were by far the most frequent type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, representing 67 cases (93%); only five patients (7%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were classified according to two modern systems (Kiel and Working Formulation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The age distribution of NHL patients was bimodal, with the highest peak in the 0 to 14 years age group (these cases were almost exclusively associated with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>), and with the second highest peak in the 55 to 64 years age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The male to female ratio was 2.5:1, and the overall median age was 44 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to the Working Formulation, the NHL cases were composed of one follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1.5%), 55 diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (82%), and 11 miscellaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (16.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was the most frequent NHL (17 cases; 25.4%), followed by diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (15 cases; 22.4%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (nine cases; 13.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consequently, high-grade NHL formed the largest group (28 cases; 42%), intermediate-grade NHL formed the next largest group (21 cases; 31.3%), and low-grade NHL formed the smallest group (seven cases; 10.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data are compared with series from developed and developing countries, and the observed differences in distribution of the histologic subtypes of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are discussed </plain></SENT>
