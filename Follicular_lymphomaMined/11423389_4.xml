<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the association between malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> risk and the polymorphisms of the IL-1 gene family [IL-1B -31 C/T, IL-1A -889 C/T, and IL-1RN 86-bp variable number of terminal repeat (VNTR)] and myeloperoxidase (MPO -463 G/A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: The hospital-based case-control study was conducted in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotypes were examined in a total of 372 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases and 241 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relative risks were estimated by unconditional logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall allele distribution of these polymorphisms did not differ substantially between patients and controls; the odds ratios were 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.48-1.11) for the T allele carriers of IL-1B relative to the non-carriers, 1.01 (0.56-1.82) for the 2-repeat allele (allele 2) carriers of IL-1RN, 0.96 (0.62-1.48) for the T allele carriers of IL-1A, and 1.04 (0.70-1.57) for the A allele carriers of MPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses according to histology [diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLBL), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue, and others] failed to illustrate differences except for DLBL which showed a possible association with IL-1A and IL-1B polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our data show a limited association between these polymorphisms and malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> risk in total </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The possible association of the IL-1A and IL-1B polymorphisms with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLB</z:e>-needs further clarification </plain></SENT>
