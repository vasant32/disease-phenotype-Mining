<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Low grade FL is known for its indolent behavior; however, one subset of FL behave aggressively and may require intensive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of the diagnostic issues in FL is to identify this subgroup of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proliferation index can have prognostic importance in this subset of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We discuss one case of low grade FL with a paradoxically high proliferative index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 63 year male presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008940'>generalized lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> of one year duration, which was gradually increasing in size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On examination, patient had bilateral cervical, axillary and inguinal nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Biopsy of the left cervical lymph node was reported as FL-Grade 2, with high proliferative Index (60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient was put on CHOP regimen targeted for high grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and had complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High proliferative index in FL is a poor prognostic factor irrespective of the histologic grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>So, proliferative index should be assessed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of FL as an adjunct to histologic grading </plain></SENT>
