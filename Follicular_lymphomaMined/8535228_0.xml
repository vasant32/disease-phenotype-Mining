<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interferon alpha has been shown to possess a therapeutic action in numerous B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> including the early stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients with progressive WM were included in a pilot study using very low dose of interferon alpha-2a (1 Million Units 3 times a week) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of treatment was 10.3 months (range 2-44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six of 14 (42%) patients presented an increase in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level (&gt; or = 0.9 g/dL) and 4/14 (28%) had a substantial decrease of the monoclonal component (&gt; or = 20% of reduction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only two patients presented both types of response, while the others with an increase in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level had a slight decrease in the monoclonal component (MC) (1 patient), a stable MC (1 patient) or a slight increase of MC (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One additional patient had a 15% decrease of the MC with a stable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Response was observed within 3 months with a median duration of 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment was stopped for 3 patients because of flu-like symptoms (2 patients), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow up was possible in 12 patients lasting up to a maximum of 30 months after discontinuing treatment </plain></SENT>
