<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: Background Pediatric follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has recently been recognized as a novel variant of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the World Health Organization classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given the rarity of the disease, histopathological and genetic data on this type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are still scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed 25 cases of pediatric follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (patients aged &lt;or=18 years) by <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, immunohistochemistry and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients analyzed were treated within Non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo>--Berlin-Frankfurt-MÃ¼nster (NHL-BFM) multicenter trials, and the cohort was representative of the German population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The genetic hallmark of adult follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, t(14;18)(q32;q21), was not detectable in any of the pediatric cases, although BCL2 protein was expressed in 55% of the latter cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between BCL2 protein expression and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal breaks in the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGH) and the BCL6 locus were detected in 5 of 17 and 1 of 18 cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with pediatric follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had long event-free survival and, in contrast to adult follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the clinical course was not dominated by relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A simultaneous diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was frequently detected at initial diagnosis in children but did not indicate an aggressive clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions Our data suggest that pediatric follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is a disease that differs from its adult counterpart both genetically and clinically </plain></SENT>
