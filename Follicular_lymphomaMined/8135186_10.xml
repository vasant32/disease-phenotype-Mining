<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Discordant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are those in which two different histologic subtypes of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are present simultaneously in the same patient at two or more separate disease sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Discordance usually involves a lower grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in one anatomic site and a higher grade diffuse lesion elsewhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A common type of discordance is seen in patients with a primary diagnosis of diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL) who demonstrate bone marrow involvement by a lower grade lesion, such as a small cleaved cell or mixed small cleaved and large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to assess retrospectively the clinical implications of such bone marrow involvement, as well as the possible biologic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 59 DLCL cases studied, 20 (33.9%) showed evidence of bone marrow involvement, 14 of which were discordant (70%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most significant findings included the following: Overall treatment responses and survivals in discordant patients with predominantly small cleaved cells in the marrow were similar to those in patients with no marrow involvement (mean survivals, 47.7 and 49 months, respectively), and were significantly longer than in patients with concordant marrow involvement (mean survival, 13.1 months, P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with discordant marrow infiltrates composed of a mixed cell population tended to do as poorly as those with concordant involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No clear-cut pattern of relapse in discordant patients was found, but persistence of small cleaved cells in some was reminiscent of lower grade B-cell lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other features associated with lower grade lesions included older age, less incidence of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement, and lesser extent and proportion of marrow infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, in approximately half the cases with discordant involvement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was present unilaterally, emphasizing the need to perform bilateral biopsies for staging </plain></SENT>
