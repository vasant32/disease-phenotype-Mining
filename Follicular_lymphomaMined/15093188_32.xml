<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have hypothesized that cellular immunotherapy targeting CD20(+) cells might provide a more effective mechanism for eliminating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells than anti-CD20 antibodies and are therefore investigating the utility of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) genetically modified to target the CD20 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were activated with anti-CD3 antibody (OKT3) and recombinant human interleukin-2 and electroporated with a plasmid containing a CD20-specific scFvFc:zeta chimeric T cell receptor gene and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7507">neomycin</z:chebi> phosphotransferase gene (neo(R)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transfected cells were selected using the antibiotic G418 and cloned by limiting dilution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using this approach, we have generated CD8(+) CTL clones with CD20-specific cytotoxicity, which specifically lysed CD20(+) target cells, including actual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells from patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CTL clones have been expanded to numbers sufficient for therapy ( approximately 10(9) cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate the feasibility of generating and expanding CD20-specific CTL and, for the first time, demonstrate that such CTL exhibit specific cytotoxicity against actual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells isolated from patients with a variety of B lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In view of these promising findings, a Phase I clinical trial for relapsed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is being initiated </plain></SENT>
