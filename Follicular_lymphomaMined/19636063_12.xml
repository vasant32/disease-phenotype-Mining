<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We show that a network of gene transcriptional modules underlies HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Central to the network hierarchy is a signature strikingly enriched for pluripotency-related genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These genes are typically expressed in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), including MYC and its direct targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This core ESC-like program was independent of proliferation/cell-cycle and overlapped but was distinct from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cell transcriptional programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we show that the ESC program is correlated with transcriptional programs maintaining <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> phenotype in transgenic MYC-driven mouse models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although our approach was to identify HT mechanisms rather than to derive an optimal survival predictor, a model based on ESC/differentiation programs stratified patient outcomes in 2 independent patient cohorts and was predictive of propensity of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> to transform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transformation was associated with an expression signature combining high expression of ESC transcriptional programs with reduced expression of stromal programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together, these findings suggest a central role for an ESC-like signature in the mechanism of HT and provide new clues for potential therapeutic targets </plain></SENT>
