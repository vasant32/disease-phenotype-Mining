<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 53 patients with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 20 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade 3 with &gt;75% follicular growth pattern the following was performed: 1) determination of protein expression of BCL6, CD10, MUM1/IRF4, CD138, and BCL2 by immunohistochemistry; 2) subclassification into germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) and activated B-cell-like (ABC) groups according to the results of protein expression; 3) detection of t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IgH-BCL2 and BCL6 abnormalities by fluorescent in situ hybridization in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade 3 with &gt;75% follicular growth pattern as well as in GCB and ABC groups; and 4) assessment of the influence of the analyzed characteristics and clinical prognostic factors on overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only BCL6 expression was more frequently found in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade 3 with &gt;75% follicular growth pattern than in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (P=0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in BCL2 and BCL6 gene abnormalities between diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade 3 with &gt;75% follicular growth pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade 3 with &gt;75% follicular growth pattern patients were equally distributed in GCB and ABC groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>t(14;18)(q32;q21) was more frequently recorded in GCB group, and t(14;18)(q32;q21) with BCL2 additional signals or only BCL2 and IgH additional signals in ABC group (P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The GCB and ABC groups showed no difference in BCL6 gene abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no overall survival difference between the diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade 3 with &gt;75% follicular growth pattern patients, however, GCB group had longer overall survival than ABC group (P=0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that BCL6, CD10, and BCL2 expression, BCL2 and BCL6 abnormalities, and International Prognostic Index were not significantly related to overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade 3 with &gt;75% follicular growth pattern patients have very similar characteristics and their prognosis is more influenced by protein expression of B-cell differentiation stage genes than by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells growth pattern, BCL2 and BCL6 abnormalities, and International Prognostic Index </plain></SENT>
