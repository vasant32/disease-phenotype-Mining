<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This program resulted in a complete remission (CR) rate of 81%, a 5-year survival of 75%, and 5-year relapse-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) of 52% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of potential factors affecting treatment outcome revealed a significantly better CR rate for patients with small cleaved cell type (97%) than for patients with mixed (73%) or large-cell (57%) histologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival was significantly better for patients with small cleaved (91%) and mixed (84%) cell types than for large cell (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, bulky abdominal disease and elevated serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) were significant adverse prognostic factors for CR and for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was moderate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> have occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This combined modality regimen resulted in prolonged remission and potential cure for over half of patients who achieved CR, and is particularly encouraging for those with follicular small cleaved and mixed histologies </plain></SENT>
