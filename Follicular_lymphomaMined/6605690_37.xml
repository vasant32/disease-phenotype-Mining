<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001050'>plethora</z:hpo> of classifications for non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHLs) and controversy regarding the merits of the individual classification schemes has led to the articulation of an International Working Formulation for NHL classification by a working group sponsored by the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This classification is based on both architectural and cytologic features and has been shown to have clinical relevance, but it is not an immunologic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the use of frozen sections and both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, a comprehensive immunohistologic study was made of 564 biopsy specimens 1) for determination of the utility of the principle of monoclonality in differentiating benign from malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, 2) for definition of the immunohistochemical phenotypes of histologically benign and malignant cellular proliferations, and 3) for evaluation of the immunologic phenotype of 257 non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> classified by the International Working Formulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred seven "reactive benign" lymphoproliferations demonstrated polyclonal immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal kappa light chain immunostaining was demonstrated in 3 of 4 cases classified as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_483'>atypical hyperplasia</z:mpath>, two of which had coexistent NHL or subsequently developed overt NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Frozen tissue sections were found to be essential for demonstration of immunoglobulin and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> membrane antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of immunohistochemical studies were readily integrated with the International Formulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although diffuse mixed and small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were immunologically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> (both T- and B-cell), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were invariably of B-cell type, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> originating from homogeneous T- and B-cell populations were identified </plain></SENT>
