<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), genomic polymorphisms corresponding to the expression of valine (V) or phenylalanine (F) at amino acid 158 of Fc gamma RIIIa alter the binding affinity of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) to the receptor and have been associated with varied responses to rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined Fc gamma RIIIa polymorphisms of 30 CLL patients with the phenotypes V/V (n = 6), V/F (n = 12), and F/F (n = 12) treated with thrice-weekly rituximab (375 mg/m(2)) for 4 weeks to correlate polymorphism type with infusion toxicity and response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Infusion toxicity (grade 3 or greater or <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> requiring transient cessation of therapy) was observed equally among the groups (V/V, 50%; V/F, 33%; F/F, 41.6%; P =.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The response to rituximab was also similar among the different polymorphism phenotypes (V/V, 33%; V/F, 41.6%; F/F, 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that Fc gamma RIIIa polymorphisms are not predictive of response in CLL and that, unlike the case with FL, mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> clearance other than antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity may be more important </plain></SENT>
