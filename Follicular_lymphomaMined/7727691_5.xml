<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A positive signal was detected in 16 cases, which included high grade B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IL-13 mRNA was also detected in the 9 malignant B cell lines and in the 6 lymphoblastoid cell lines tested, as well as in freshly isolated malignant B cells from 2 patients with a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of 8 T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 2 of 4 T-cell lines expressed the IL-13 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IL-13 gene expression was not detected in any of the 5 non-lymphoid cell lines tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No specific binding of radiolabeled IL-13 was detected on B cell lines, suggesting an absence of IL-13 receptors on such cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This conclusion was also supported by the inability of IL-13 or anti-IL-13 antibodies to affect the growth of malignant B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results show that both malignant and EBV-transformed B lymphocytes, either freshly isolated or maintained as cell lines, express the IL-13 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This raises the question of the role of B lymphocyte-derived IL-13, a B lymphocyte stimulating cytokine, on the in vivo function of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B lymphocytes as well as on the in vivo behaviour of B lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
