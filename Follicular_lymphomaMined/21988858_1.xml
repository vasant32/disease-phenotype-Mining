<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recently, human germinal center-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (HGAL) gene protein has been proposed as an adjunctive follicular marker to CD10 and BCL6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our aim was to evaluate immunoreactivity for HGAL in 82 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs)--67 nodal, 5 cutaneous and 10 transformed--which were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> analysed histologically, by immunohistochemistry and PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immunostaining for HGAL was more frequently positive (97.6%) than that for BCL6 (92.7%) and CD10 (90.2%) in FLs; the cases negative for bcl6 and/or for CD10 were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> positive for HGAL, whereas the two cases negative for HGAL were positive with BCL6; no difference in HGAL immunostaining was found among different malignant subtypes or grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, HGAL can be used in the immunostaining of FLs as the most sensitive germinal center (GC)-marker; when applied alone, it would half the immunostaining costs, reserving the use of the other two markers only to HGAL-negative cases </plain></SENT>
