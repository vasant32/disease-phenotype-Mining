<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The impact of the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) histologic grade on outcomes after high-dose therapy (HDT) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 219 consecutive patients with grades 1-3 FL who underwent HDT and ASCT at our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), relapse and non-relapse mortality (NRM) was estimated for each grade after controlling for other predictive factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of patients with grades 1, 2 and 3 FL was 106 (48%), 75 (34%) and 38 (17%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five-year outcome estimates for the entire cohort included 60% OS, 39% PFS and 46% relapse (median follow-up=7.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PFS and relapse were nearly identical among patients with grade 3 FL versus grades 1-2 FL after adjusting for other contributing factors (hazard ratio (HR)=0.90, P=0.68; HR=1.07, P=0.80, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hazard for mortality (HR=0.70, P=0.23) and NRM (HR=0.33, P=0.07) was non-significantly lower among patients with grade 3 FL compared to patients with grades 1-2 disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with inferior PFS included elevated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (HR=1.52, P=0.03), chemoresistance (HR=1.82, P=0.02), &gt; or =2 prior therapies (HR=1.8, P=0.03) and prior radiation (HR=1.99, P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the histologic grade of FL does not impact PFS or relapse following HDT and ASCT </plain></SENT>
