<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten out of 56 cases showed bcl-2 gene rearrangement; it was detected in only 5 out of 16 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases (31%) and in 5 out of 40 diffuse B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of bcl-2 gene involvement in Japanese follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was lower than those reported in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This might contribute to the lower incidence of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Novel recombination between bcl-2 and Ig kappa genes at the 5' region of bcl-2 and J kappa 4 segment was observed in one follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> case, suggesting that bcl-2 gene is transcriptionally activated by Ig kappa enhancer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was also suggested that this case had originated from a more differentiated B cell than most follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with bcl-2-Ig H recombination </plain></SENT>
