<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the clinical and pathologic features of 26 patients with primary gastrointestinal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten of 26 patients (38.5%) were stage IIE, and 16 patients (61.5%) were stage IE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 26 patients, 13 were female and 13 were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The age range was 26-81 years (median 54.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>Abdominal pain</z:hpo> was the most common presenting symptom, seen in 12 of 24 patients (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nodularity of the mucosal surface was the most common endoscopic finding, seen in 10 of 14 patients (71.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of cases (22 of 26, 84.6%) involved small bowel, four involved colorectum alone, and two involved the ileocecal valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within the small bowel the duodenum was the most commonly involved site (10 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transmural involvement by follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was identified in 11 of the 16 patients who underwent surgical resection; five showed involvement of mucosa and submucosa only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common histologic grade was grade 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of 26 cases were grade 1, ten grade 2, and three grade 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one of 26 cases showed a predominantly follicular growth pattern, four mixed follicular and diffuse, and one predominantly diffuse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were positive for CD20 and BCL2 and negative for CD3, CD5, CD23, CD43, and cyclin D1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four of 26 were positive for CD10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Four of four cases showed cytogenetic or molecular genetic evidence of t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Initial treatment modalities included surgery plus chemotherapy (nine cases), surgery alone (seven cases), chemotherapy alone (four cases), observation alone (four cases), and chemotherapy and abdominal radiation (one case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>One case presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100896'>rectal polyps</z:hpo> and was treated with polypectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A complete response was observed in 15 of 22 cases that received treatment, and of the 15 cases, five recurred 27-60 months after the initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Recurrence and progression were associated with histologic transformation to diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was identified between treatment response and various clinical and pathologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Overall, none of the 26 patients died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>One patient died of a concomitant pancreatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 25 patients, 14 were disease free and 11 were alive with disease at a mean follow-up of 43 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The estimated 5-year disease-free survival was 62%, and median disease-free survival was 69 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The estimated 5-year relapse-free survival was 54%, and the median relapse-free survival was 63 months </plain></SENT>
