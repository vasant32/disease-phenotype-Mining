<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that some patterns of global <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modification are specific to both particular cell types of non-neoplastic tissues and their neoplastic counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To examine the hypothesis in lymphoid cells, global <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modification patterns of germinal center and mantle zone B cells in reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> (RLH) were compared with those of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (MTL) cells by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We revealed that FL cells and MTL cells exhibited the similar <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modification pattern to that of germinal center B lymphocytes and mantle zone B lymphocytes in RLH, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that global <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modification profiles specific to non-neoplastic germinal center B lymphocytes and mantle zone B lymphocytes are well conserved in corresponding neoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, and suggest that they will be indicative of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell type at least in B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
