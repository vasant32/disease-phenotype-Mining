<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The occurrence and pattern of cytoplasmic muramidase containing histiocytes were studied by the unlabeled antibody peroxidase-antiperoxidase method in biopsy material from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and reactive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of lymph nodes from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and reactive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> gave positive staining reactions when tested in this manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Differences in the staining pattern were observed for the different conditions studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In general, stain positive cells occurred in one of the following four patterns: nodular, dispersed, aggregating without background stain, or aggregating with background stain (mottling pattern) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The nodular and aggregating without background stain patterns were not specific and were seen in various conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dispersed pattern, however, was observed only in some cases of non-Hodgkin's diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, suggesting a subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> characterized by active participation of reactive histiocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mottling pattern was virtually limited to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since the mottling pattern appeared to be produced by virtue of a large amount of extracellular muramidase, the elevation of the serum muramidase level in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> may be related to enzymatically active secretory histiocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the mottling staining pattern was observed frequently in the lymphocytic predominance and nodular <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, but relatively infrequently in the mixed cellularity or lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> types, suggesting that the variation in histiocytic activity may be related to the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The decreased staining reaction observed in the latter two categories could not be accounted for by a decrease in the numbers of histiocytic cells in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin stained sections, suggesting that release or synthesis may be defective in those unfavorable types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
