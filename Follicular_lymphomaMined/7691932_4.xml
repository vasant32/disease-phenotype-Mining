<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a method that enables detection and immunophenotypical characterization of distinct subpopulations within a cytogenetically defined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Coexisting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells do not hinder microscopic evaluation because they can be distinguished from cytogenetically aberrant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is also true when <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic cells cannot be clearly distinguished by cytology or immunohistochemistry, i.e., if both constituents have similar immunophenotypes and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The method is based on fluorescence double staining for two different antigens combined with interphase cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is referred to as "Fluorescence immunophenotyping and Interphase Cytogenetics as a Tool for Investigation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Neoplasms</z:hpo> (FICTION)." In a case of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> we demonstrate that FICTION can differentiate bcl-2-positive malignant and non-malignant cells and can verify the presence of bcl-2-positive but cytogenetically inconspicuous T-lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
