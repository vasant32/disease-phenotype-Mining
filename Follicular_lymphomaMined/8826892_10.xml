<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are often associated with t(14;18) chromosomal translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rearrangement site (bcl-2/JH junctional region) between the two chromosomes is hypervariable regarding its size and DNA sequence, and is a potential specific marker for the neoplastic clone of each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique for detecting and sequencing clonal bcl-2/JH rearrangements in lymph nodes and/or bone marrow specimens from patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>53 patients at diagnosis (n = 40) or at relapse (n = 13) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>25 of these 53 cases were found to have the t(14;18) translocation involving either the major breakpoint region (MBR) (n = 21) or the minor cluster region (mcr) (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since our PCR technique could detect the translocation in 1/10(6) cells we had to distinguish malignant cells from possible t(14;18)-bearing non-malignant cells which could be present during and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2/JH junctional regions were therefore sequenced in order to synthesize an anti-junction oligonucleotide probe specific for each patient's malignant clone (clonospecific probe) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using these clonospecific probes for hybridization it was possible to detect one malignant cell mixed with 10(6) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>28 patients with advanced stage (stage III and IV), had been enrolled for treatment with myeloablative chemoradiotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 12 of these patients bcl-2/MBR translocation was found at diagnosis and used as a marker to detect the presence of residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in serial bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In three relapsed patients (with available tissue samples at diagnosis and relapse), clonospecific probes clearly demonstrated the same bcl-2/JH junction, thus confirming that the relapse occurred from the same malignant clone, and which remained stable without any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> of its junctional region throughout the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate the value of the t(14;18) clonospecific probes as a diagnostic tool in the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> and relapses in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
