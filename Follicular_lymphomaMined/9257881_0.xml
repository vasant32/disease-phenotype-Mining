<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few data are available on the quantitation by PCR of these translocations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report that only one of five studied FL patients had a high level of these translocations in the circulation, namely, about 35,000 translocations per 5 x 10(6) PBM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This patient was stable with an excellent performance status at the time of this assay; however, he died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> 1 month later </plain></SENT>
