<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, a CD20-negative phenotypic change in CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B-NHL) after rituximab therapy was described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the follow-up data of 10 B-NHL patients showing this change after rituximab therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (4 men and 6 women; median age, 57 y) with B-NHL who were initially CD20 positive and became CD20 negative after rituximab therapy were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathologic features, including clinical course, CD20 expression, and histopathology, were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD20 expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells was evaluated using immunohistochemistry and/or flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histopathologically, diagnosis at initial presentation was follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) in 7 patients; diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 1; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients (60%, 3 FL, 1 diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> patients) showed continuous CD20 negativity until 24 months after the phenotypic change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients (30%) with FL regained CD20 expression within 1 to 7 months after detection of the CD20 change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients (20%) with FL, including 1 who regained CD20 expression, showed heterogenous CD20 expression with a CD20-negative low-grade component and a CD20-positive large cell component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate to therapy before the CD20-negative change was 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We reported the follow-up data of 10 B-NHL patients with a CD20-negative phenotypic change associated with rituximab-containing therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most common histologic phenotypes were continuous CD20 negativity, recovery of CD20 expression within 7 months, and heterogenous CD20 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As the changes in <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and CD20 expression after rituximab therapy vary widely, careful follow-up and rebiopsy are recommended </plain></SENT>
