<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The predominant cell, the prolymphocyte, has distinct features which were common to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases: it is a relatively large lymphoid cell with a prominent nucleolus, well condensed peripheral nuclear chromatin and a variable amount of heterochromatin in intranuclear clumps </plain></SENT>
