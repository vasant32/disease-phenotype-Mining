<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-1 is known to negatively regulate T-cell receptor-mediated proliferation and cytokine production, lead to alternation in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although several studies have shown that high levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-1-positive cells in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) patients influence their prognosis, those studies included patients treated without rituximab, and the prognostic impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-1 positivity in the rituximab era (R-era) has not yet been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively studied 82 patients with FL uniformly treated with standard R-CHOP therapy at six institutions between 2001 and 2009 (median follow-up for survivors: 55 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also collected and examined biopsy specimens for diagnosis with respect to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-1 positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-1 positivity was significantly higher in male patients and patients with high beta-2 microglobulin (B2M ≥ 3.0) (P = 0.03 and 0.003, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three-year progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 60% and 86%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By univariate analysis, elevated LDH (P = 0.07) worsened PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Male gender (P = 0.03), high FLIPI score (P = 0.05), and high B2M levels (P = 0.08) worsened OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis detected no significant prognostic factors, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-1 positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in male subgroup, high levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-1-positive cells were found to be a prognostic factor for PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Addition of rituximab might have altered the prognostic impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-1-positive cells </plain></SENT>
