<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (27%) showed unequivocal evidence of transformation to a high grade variety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These included 4 out of 21 cases originally having had follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 4 out of 9 cases having had diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 2 further patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, relapse was diagnosed following examination of the bone marrow and in one the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> had clearly transformed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 5 of the transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> the cell type was predominantly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e>, in 2 immunoblastic and in the remaining 2 centrocytic (anaplastic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five of the 9 cases developing high grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> have died after a median interval of 5 months from transformation, whereas only 3 of 23 cases showing no change are dead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 4 patients low grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> persisted in the bone marrow at the time of nodal transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical circumstances at the time of rebiopsy were unhelpful in predicting transformation </plain></SENT>
