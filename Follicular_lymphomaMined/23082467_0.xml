<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, Tregs also pose a major problem to anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519680" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumor immunity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expansion and accumulation of these immunosuppressive cells correlate with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> and predict poor disease prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study aims at evaluation of the clinical role of regulatory T cells in B-cell Non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study was carried out on 45 de novo patients with B- NHL, they included 26 males and 19 females and 20 apparently healthy age-matched as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was done by lymph node biopsy, 15 patients had diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), 9 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), 8 small cell lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (SCLL), 7 marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>) and 6 had mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tregs (CD4+CD25+ FoxP+3) were analyzed by Flowcytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean percent was 10.9 +/- 1.6% in diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 12.4 +/- 1.4% in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 13.7 +/- 2.4% in small cell lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 11.9 +/- 1.9% in marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 13.5 +/- 1.35% in mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> as compared to 5.9 +/- 0.96% in controls with a significant increase in the patients in relation to control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tregs was significantly increased in advanced stages of the disease, in bone marrow infiltration and in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002944'>increased LDH level</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, Tregs may play a role in modifying immune responses in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and may be useful in immunotherapy and new anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> strategies involving <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of Tregs </plain></SENT>
