<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The incidences of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> are increasing steadily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been hypothesized that this may be due, in part, to the parallel rising prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is biologically plausible that anthropometric characteristics can infuence the risk of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: In the context of the European Prospective Investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition (EPIC), anthropometric characteristics were assessed in 371,983 cancer-free individuals at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the 8.5 years of follow-up, 1,219 histologically confirmed incident cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> occurred in 609 men and 610 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gender-specific proportional hazards models were used to estimate relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of development of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> in relation to the anthropometric characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Height was associated with overall non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> in women (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.14-1.98) for highest versus lowest quartile; p-trend &lt; 0.01) but not in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (weight and body mass index) nor abdominal fat (waist-to-hip ratio, waist or hip circumference) measures were positively associated with overall non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relative risks for highest versus lowest body mass index quartile were 1.09 (95% CI 0.85-1.38) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.71-1.19) for men and women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Women in the upper body mass index quartile were at greater risk of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (RR 2.18, 95% CI 1.05-4.53) and taller women had an elevated risk of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.59-2.62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among men, height and body mass index were non-significantly, positively related to follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>Multiple myeloma</z:hpo> risk alone was elevated for taller women (RR 2.34, 95% CI 1.29-4.21) and heavier men (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.02-3.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The EPIC analyses support an association between height and overall non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> among women and suggest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> subtype associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This is one of the first prospective studies focusing on central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
