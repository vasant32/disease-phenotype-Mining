<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>F(ab')2 antibody fragments were used to avoid binding by Fc receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 20 cases the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> nodules comprised a monoclonal population of immunoglobulin-producing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The nodules were usually surrounded by a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, polyclonal population of B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reactive lymphoid follicles were easily differentiated from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> nodules on the basis of clonality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight cases contained multiple immunoglobulin heavy chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> nodules in the same tissue or in multiple tissues in the same patient showed identical light-chain and heavy-chain staining even if different histologic subtypes were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is the outgrowth of a single clone of immunoglobulin-bearing cells that retain the tissue-homing characteristics of B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
