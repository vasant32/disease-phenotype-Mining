<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: PCR detects clonal rearrangements of the Ig gene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>False negativity occurs in germinal centre/post-germinal centre <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (GC/PGCLs) as they display a high rate of somatic hypermutation (SHM), which causes primer mismatching when detecting Ig rearrangements by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate the degree of SHM in a group of GC/PGCLs and assess the rate of false negativity when using BIOMED-2 PCR when compared with previously published strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DNA was isolated from snap-frozen tissue from 49 patients with GC/PGCL (23 diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e>), 26 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs)) and PCR-amplified for complete (VDJH), incomplete (DJH) and Ig kappa/lambda rearrangements using the BIOMED-2 protocols, and compared with previously published methods using consensus primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Germinal centre phenotype was defined by immunohistochemistry based on CD10, Bcl-6 and MUM-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clonality detection by amplifying Ig rearrangements using BIOMED-2 family-specific primers was considerably higher than that found using consensus primers (74% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and 96% FL vs 69% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and 73% FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Addition of BIOMED-2 DJH rearrangements increased detection of clonality by 22% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SHM was present in VDJH rearrangements from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (median (range) 5.7% (2.5-13.5)) and FL (median (range) 5.3% (2.3-11.9)) with a clonal rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Use of BIOMED-2 primers has significantly reduced the false negative rate associated with GC/PGCL when compared with consensus primers, and the inclusion of DJH rearrangements represents a potential complementary target for clonality assessment, as SHM is thought not to occur in these types of rearrangements </plain></SENT>
