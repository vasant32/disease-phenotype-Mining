<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively evaluated the association of the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) and other characteristics with survival following high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in 207 consecutive follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The FLIPI was associated with OS both when evaluated as a categorical variable (0 - 1 vs. 2 vs. 3 vs. 4, p = 0.01, global test) and a continuous linear variable (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The association of FLIPI with survival appeared to be more relevant for patients who received standard conditioning regimens compared to those that were treated with high-dose radioimmunotherapy (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, mortality was also associated with chemosensitive disease (HR = 0.47, p = 0.01) or untreated relapse (HR = 0.20, p = 0.0002) vs. chemoresistant disease, and &gt; or =2 extranodal sites (HR = 2.82, p = 0.03) after adjusting for FLIPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the FLIPI and select non-FLIPI factors after adjustment for the FLIPI are associated with survival in FL patients undergoing ASCT </plain></SENT>
