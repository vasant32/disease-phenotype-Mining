<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess its clinical significance in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, realtime quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of bcl-xL gene expression was investigated in whole lymph node sections and laser-microdissected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells of 27 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared with 10 patients with reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo>, the bcl-xL gene was overexpressed in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at a higher level in microdissected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The bcl-xL gene level correlated with the number of apoptotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells labeled by terminal deoxytransferase-catalyzed DNA nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays (r = -0.7736) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinically, a high bcl-xL level was significantly associated with multiple sites of extranodal involvement (P =.0020), <z:mp ids='MP_0002944'>elevated lactate dehydrogenase level</z:mp> (P =.0478), and an International Prognostic Index indicating high risk (P =.0235) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, bcl-xL gene overexpression was linked to short overall survival times (P =.0129) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The value of bcl-xL gene expression as a prognostic marker in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> should thus be considered </plain></SENT>
