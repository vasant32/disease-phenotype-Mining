<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Southwest <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group (SWOG) conducted a phase 2 trial (S9911) of a novel regimen consisting of 6 cycles of CHOP (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>) chemotherapy followed 4 to 8 weeks later by tositumomab/<z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> I 131 tositumomab (anti-CD20 antibody) in 90 eligible patients with previously untreated, advanced stage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> was the main adverse event and was more severe during CHOP chemotherapy than following radioimmunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate to the entire treatment regimen was 90%, including 67% complete remissions (CRs plus unconfirmed CRs [CRu's]) and 23% partial remissions (PRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven (57%) of the 47 fully evaluable patients who achieved less than a CR with CHOP improved their remission status after tositumomab/<z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> I 131 tositumomab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 2.3 years, the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) was estimated to be 81%, with a 2-year overall survival of 97% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study has established the feasibility, tolerability, and efficacy of this regimen for patients with advanced follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This novel treatment appears promising compared with the SWOG's historical experience using CHOP alone and is currently being compared with CHOP plus rituximab in a randomized phase 3 trial (S0016) </plain></SENT>
