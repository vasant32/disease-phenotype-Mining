<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE The randomized First-Line Indolent Trial (FIT) was conducted in patients with advanced follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), to evaluate the safety and efficacy of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">yttrium</z:chebi>-90 ((90)Y) ibritumomab tiuxetan given as consolidation of complete or partial remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> was undertaken in parallel, to determine the rate of conversion from bcl-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -detectable to -undetectable status and the corresponding effect on progression-free survival (PFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS Blood samples from 414 patients ((90)Y-ibritumomab, n = 208; control, n = 206) were evaluated using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR); 186 were found to have the bcl-2 rearrangement and were thus eligible for inclusion in the RQ-PCR analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results Overall, 90% of treated patients converted from bcl-2 PCR-detectable to -undetectable disease status, compared with 36% in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment significantly prolonged median PFS in patients converting to bcl-2 PCR-undetectable status (40.8 v 24.0 months in the control group; P &lt; .01, hazard ratio [HR], 0.399) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients who had bcl-2 PCR-detectable disease at random assignment, treatment significantly prolonged median PFS (38.4 v 8.2 months in the control group; P &lt; .01, HR, 0.293) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION Eradication of PCR-detectable disease occurred more frequently after treatment with (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan and was associated with prolongation of PFS </plain></SENT>
