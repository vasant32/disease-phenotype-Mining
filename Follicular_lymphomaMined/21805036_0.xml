<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (HER) family consists of four receptors that bind to ligands sharing an EGF-like motif </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands (EGF family) are known to play a significant role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular, the EGF receptor, HER1, is one of the main candidates for the molecular-targeted therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, and HER2 is a candidate for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> which overexpresses HER2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the role of the HER and EGF families in malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has not been fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the expression and function of the HER and EGF families in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed that the ligands for HER1 were mainly expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines, but not in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the EGF family member, neuregulin (NRG) 4, was highly expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analyses of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> clinical samples revealed that NRG4 and HER4 were mainly expressed in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation of Raji and Daudi cell lines revealed that recombinant NRG4 induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of HER4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, recombinant NRG4 activated the proliferation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the NRG4-HER4 axis plays a major role in the proliferation of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
