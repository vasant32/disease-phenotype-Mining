<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Geographic variations in the histopathologic pattern of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) are well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Insight into this epidemiologic data might shed light on the underlying etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, there is a paucity of information regarding the pattern of NHL occurring in Thailand and Southeast Asia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current nationwide study was undertaken to obtain a clearer definition of the disease among Thais and to compare this information with data from other Asian and Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis of histopathologic subtypes and clinical features was conducted in 1391 patients (age &gt; or = 15 years) with NHL, who were treated at 6 major medical centers in 4 representative areas of Thailand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred and thirty unselected cases were immunohistochemically studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reports from other countries used for comparison were identified through a computerized search on MEDLINE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the total cases studied, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> constituted 3.8% and diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> 91.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of low and intermediate grade (including large cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e>, using the Working Formulation) were 12.8% and 72.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common histologic subtype was the diffuse large cell and large cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> entity, which constituted 39.9% of the cases studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate of small lymphocytic and diffuse small cleaved subtypes were higher than in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 130 cases studied, T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> comprised 16.1%, which was much less than in Japan, China, or Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The histopathologic pattern of NHL in Thailand was characterized by the features noted for Asia, i.e., a low rate of the follicular entity and a preponderance of the diffuse aggressive subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, the frequency of the small lymphocytic and diffuse small cleaved subtypes were increased compared with the Western population and the rate of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> appeared to be less than in Far East Asia </plain></SENT>
