<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONTEXT: The World Health Organization classification recommends categorizing grade 3 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> based on the presence of centrocytes (grade 3A) or of sheets of centroblasts (grade 3B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of this practice is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether grade 3 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtype is associated with prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Multi-institutional retrospective case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-five cases of grade 3 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> without diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were studied (35 cases of grade 3A, 10 cases of grade 3B) from 21 men and 24 women (median age, 67 years; mean age, 63.8 years; range, 26-86 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up information from the time of diagnosis was available in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, with a median follow-up time of 24 months (mean, 34 months; range, 2- 115 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment information was available in 40 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in age (P =.45, Wilcoxon test) or stage (P =.76, Fisher exact test) between patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of grade 3A or grade 3B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the Cochran-Armitage test for trends showed no evidence that the proportion of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade 3A or 3B increased or decreased with increasing stage at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a median overall survival of 44 months from the time grade 3 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was diagnosed, with no significant difference between cases diagnosed as grade 3A or grade 3B (P =.14, log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Univariable Cox proportional hazards modeling showed no evidence that an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-containing chemotherapy regimen or history of lower grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> affected overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective series, subclassification of grade 3 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> into type 3A and 3B categories had limited clinical and prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the study was limited by lack of statistical power </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Since <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> often provides clues for progress in defining biologic differences, subtyping may still be useful, particularly in the setting of prospective clinical studies </plain></SENT>
