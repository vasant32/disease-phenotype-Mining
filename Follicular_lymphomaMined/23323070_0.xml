<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Brazil, it is the fifth cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, with more than 55,000 cases and 26,000 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo - HCFMUSP, diffuse large B-Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> represents 49.7% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initially, the classification of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was based on <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, but advances in immunology and molecular medicine allowed the introduction of a biological classification for these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As for other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involves patterns of multifactorial pathogenesis with environmental factors, as well as genetic, occupational and dietary factors, contributing to its development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple lesions involving molecular pathways of B-cell proliferation and differentiation may result in the activation of oncogenes such as the BCL2, BCL6, and MYC genes and the inactivation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes such as p53 and INK4, as well as other important transcription factors such as OCT-1 and OCT-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A dramatic improvement in survival was seen after the recent introduction of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association of this antibody to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (CHOP) regimen has increased overall survival of diffuse large B-Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients by 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, 50% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diffuse large B-Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients remain incurable, creating a demand for more research with new advances in treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is important to know and understand the key factors and molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of diffuse large B-Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
