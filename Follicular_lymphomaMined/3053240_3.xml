<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ALP activity was found in malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ML), follicular, small cleaved cell (1/5 cases); ML, diffuse, small cleaved cell (3/13 cases); and mantle zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (intermediate lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) (2/2 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ALP-positive neoplastic cells simultaneously displayed the characteristic immunophenotype of mantle zone (MZ) B lymphocytes of secondary follicle (SIg D+, BA-1+, IL-2R+ and Leu-1+) </plain></SENT>
