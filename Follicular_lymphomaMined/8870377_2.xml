<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our single-center experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six adults (four with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, one follicular center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and one mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five received bone marrow while one received peripheral blood stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Donors were HLA-identical siblings in five cases and an HLA-haploidentical sibling in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen included in five cases <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, TB1 and high-dose <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi>, without the latter in the patient with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five patients successfully engrafted, while the patient who received the haploidentical marrow suffered primary graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were two cases of grade 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD and one limited <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients are alive in complete remission (CR) with a follow-up of 17+ to 118+ months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, there is no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> by immunologic and molecular techniques in three cases, while one patient has <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> assessed by molecular methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that allogeneic SCT can achieve prolonged remissions in advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
