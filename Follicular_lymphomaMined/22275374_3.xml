<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18) translocation in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is one of the most common chromosomal translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Breaks in chromosome 18 are localized at the 3'-UTR of BCL2 gene or downstream and are mainly clustered in either the major breakpoint region or the minor breakpoint cluster region (mcr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The recombination activating gene (RAG) complex induces breaks at IgH locus of chromosome 14, whereas the mechanism of fragility at BCL2 mcr remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, for the first time, we show that RAGs can nick mcr; however, the mechanism is unique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three independent nicks of equal efficiency are generated, when both Mg(2+) and Mn(2+) are present, unlike a single nick during V(D)J recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, we demonstrate that RAG binding and nicking at the mcr are independent of nonamer, whereas a CCACCTCT motif plays a critical role in its fragility, as shown by sequential mutagenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More importantly, we recapitulate the BCL2 mcr translocation and find that mcr can undergo synapsis with a standard recombination signal sequence within the cells, in a RAG-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, mutation to the CCACCTCT motif abolishes recombination within the cells, indicating its vital role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hence, our data suggest a novel, physiologically relevant, nonamer-independent mechanism of RAG nicking at mcr, which may be important for generation of chromosomal translocations in humans </plain></SENT>
