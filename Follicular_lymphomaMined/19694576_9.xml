<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this article, we present the methodology for highly patient-specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> dosimetry by utilizing such a system and apply it to a pilot study of 4 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients treated with I-131 tositumomab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SPECT quantification included three-dimensional ordered-subset expectation-maximization reconstruction and CT-defined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> outlines at each time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SPECT/CT images from multiple time points were coupled to a Monte Carlo algorithm to calculate a mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> dose that incorporated measured changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> shrinkage, defined as the difference between volumes drawn on the first and last CT scan (a typical time period of 15 days) was in the range 5%-49% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The therapy-delivered mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-absorbed dose was in the range 146-334 cGy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For comparison, the therapy dose was also calculated by assuming a static volume from the initial CT and was found to underestimate this dose by up to 47% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The agreement between tracer-predicted and therapy-delivered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-absorbed dose was in the range 7%-21% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> can have dramatic <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> within days of treatment, and advanced imaging methods allow for a highly patient-specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-dosimetry calculation that accounts for this regression </plain></SENT>
