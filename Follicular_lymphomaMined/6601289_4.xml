<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After screening against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T cells, monocytes, and granulocytes 11 antibodies that reacted with cells from other B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> remained, of which 10 showed individually distinct staining patterns, as tested by indirect fluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When tested against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> or cell lines, none of these antibodies revealed staining patterns suggesting reactivity with conventional B-cell surface markers, such as immunoglobulin, complement factor 3 receptors, or HLA-DR antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only one of the antibodies (GB1) reacted with human serum, as determined by a blocking assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antibodies were found to belong to different immunoglobulin isotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two antibodies (GB13 and GB14) reacted with greater than 5% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These reactions were mainly due to reactivity with B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The antibodies reacted only in a few cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath>, B-cell lines, and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, distinct patterns of reactivity in different histological groups of diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were obtained, suggesting that the antibodies may be useful in delineating phenotypic subsets among human B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
