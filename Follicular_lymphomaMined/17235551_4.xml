<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and forty-nine NHL patients with t(14;18) and complete cytogenetic, morphologic, and clinical information were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and twelve cases were follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) and 37 were diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred and forty cases showed secondary aberrations (94%, median = 6.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most frequent were losses from chromosome arms 1p and 6q and +7 (26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Loss from 1q, +7, and +12 were more frequent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> than in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Loss from 1p, Xp, and -16 were more frequent in FL grade 3 than in FL grades 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with &lt;6.0 secondary cytogenetic aberrations had better prognosis than did those with a higher number of aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 21 was associated with shorter patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FLIPI score, the number of secondary chromosomal aberrations, and +21 were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of independent prognostic value in Cox multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FL grade 1-3a patients that had received chemotherapy, showed a higher frequency of i(6p) and loss from 6q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Secondary chromosomal aberrations showed some correlation with the morphologic subgroups of t(14;18)-NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 21 and the presence of &gt;6.0 secondary cytogenetic aberrations both correlated with shorter overall survival </plain></SENT>
