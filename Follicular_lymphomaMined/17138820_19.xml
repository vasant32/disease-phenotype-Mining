<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, CD10-MUM1+ FLs were encountered frequently in the elderly compared with CD10+MUM1- typical FLs (67.0 versus 58.7 years, P &lt; .01), showed high grade (grade 3A or 3B) <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> (91% versus 17%, P &lt; .001), diffuse proliferation (59% vs 19%, P &lt; .001), and lacked BCL2/IGH translocation (5% versus 92.5%, P &lt; .001), which is the most characteristic aberration in FL, and 88% showed BCL6 gene abnormalities (translocation or amplification) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that CD10-MUM1+ FL is different from typical FL with respect to biologic and clinical features </plain></SENT>
