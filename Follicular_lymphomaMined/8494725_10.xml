<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 33 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) (Working Formulation subtypes B, C, D) and 38 patients with intermediate-grade NHL (subtypes F, G) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the FL subgroup, 86% of the morphologically-positive bone marrow patients had amplifiable t(14;18) breakpoints by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, of 19 FL patients with 'negative' bone marrows, 11 (58%) were PCR-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, half of the early clinical stage patients (I and II) had detectable breakpoints in their bone marrow DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Samples from NHL patients with intermediate-grade disease exhibit the same phenomena but at a considerably lower frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Paired peripheral blood and bone marrow samples were available at diagnosis in a subset of 56 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The concordance between bone marrow and peripheral blood PCR findings was high, with peripheral blood of 55/56 showing the same PCR results as the corresponding bone marrow </plain></SENT>
