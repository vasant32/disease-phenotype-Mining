<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Inotuzumab ozogamicin (INO) is an antibody-targeted chemotherapy agent composed of a humanized anti-CD22 antibody conjugated to calicheamicin, a potent cytotoxic agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a phase I/II study to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of INO plus rituximab (R-INO) for treatment of relapsed/refractory CD20(+)/CD22(+) B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A dose-escalation phase to determine the MTD of R-INO was followed by an expanded cohort to further evaluate the efficacy and safety at the MTD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with relapsed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), relapsed diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), or refractory aggressive NHL received R-INO every 4 weeks for up to eight cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 118 patients received one or more cycles of R-INO (median, four cycles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most common grade 3 to 4 adverse events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (31%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Common low-grade toxicities included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> (25%) and increased AST (36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The MTD of INO in combination with rituximab (375 mg/m(2)) was confirmed to be the same as that for single-agent INO (1.8 mg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment at the MTD yielded objective response rates of 87%, 74%, and 20% for relapsed FL (n = 39), relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (n = 42), and refractory aggressive NHL (n = 30), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 68% (median, not reached) for FL and 42% (median, 17.1 months) for relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: R-INO demonstrated high response rates and long PFS in patients with relapsed FL or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This and the manageable toxicity profile suggest that R-INO may be a promising option for CD20(+)/CD22(+) B-cell NHL </plain></SENT>
