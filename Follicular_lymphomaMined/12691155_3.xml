<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective analysis of prognostic factors in patients with stage III and IV and high-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) treated with uniform schedules and with a long term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight-hundred and ten patients treated with intensive, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based, chemotherapy and adjuvant radiotherapy to sites of initial bulky nodal disease were the basis of this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age &gt;60 years, presence of B symptoms, bulky disease, &gt;2 extranodal sites involved, high levels of LDH and the presence of serous effusions <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> identified as worse prognostic factors in univariate analysis were subject to multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three factors remained significant: age &gt;60 years old, presence of B symptoms and &gt;2 extranodal sites involved and these were found to influence overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We developed a score system and only two groups (score 0 and 1 and score 2 and 3) showed statistical significance in OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the International Prognostic Index was applied to these patients, no statistical differences were observed in OS and PFS between the four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of our results with multiple previous studies showed a lack of uniform prognostic factors and adequate prognostic classification could not be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it is mandatory for multicentric international clinical analysis to define prognostic factors and search for a clinical classification, as in diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, so as to define groups of FL for more aggressive or conservative therapy </plain></SENT>
