<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Skp2, a component of the Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex, has been implicated in p27(Kip1) degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased Skp2 levels are seen in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> and are associated with reduced p27(Kip1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the expression of these proteins using single and double immunolabeling in a large series of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> to determine if alterations in their relative levels are associated with changes in cell proliferation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied the expression of Skp2 in low-grade and aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (n = 86) and compared them with p27(Kip1) and the proliferation index (PI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen hematopoietic cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes were studied by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In reactive tonsils, Skp2 expression was limited to proliferating germinal center and interfollicular cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Skp2 expression in small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLLs</z:e>) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FCLs) was low (mean percentage of positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, less than 20%) and was inversely correlated (r = -0.67; P &lt;.0001) with p27(Kip1) and positively correlated with the PI (r = 0.82; P &lt;.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By contrast, whereas most mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCLs</z:e>) demonstrated low expression of p27(Kip1) and Skp2, a subset (n = 6) expressed high Skp2 (exceeding 20%) with a high PI (exceeding 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Skp2 expression was highest in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e>) (mean, 22%) and correlated with Ki-67 (r = 0.55; P &lt;.005) but not with p27(Kip1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic Skp2 was seen in a subset of aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data provide evidence for p27(Kip1) degradative function of Skp2 in low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The absence of this relationship in aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> suggests that other factors contribute to deregulation of p27(Kip1) expression in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
