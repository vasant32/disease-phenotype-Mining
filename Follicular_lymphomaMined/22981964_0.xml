<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the paucity of literature on the treatment of TL, deciding on the optimal evidence-based treatment is a challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, our results indicate that patients with early transformation may benefit the most from SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Transformed non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> arising from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (TL) carries a poor prognosis with a median survival time after transformation reported to be approximately 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-one consecutive patients with TL received SCT between January 2000 and December 2010 (autologous SCT, n = 44, allogeneic SCT, n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-six (70.5%) patients had an early transformation, defined as histologic evidence of transformation at the time of initial diagnosis or transformation within 1 year of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients had early stage disease (29%) and 36 (71%) had advanced stage disease on presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the time of analysis, 37 patients were alive with an estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) of 61.8% and 45%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>OS and EFS were not significantly different between types of transplant procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The major cause of transplant failure was disease recurrence, with estimated 2-year relapse rate of 37.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Importantly, early transformation was independently associated with improved OS (hazard ratio [HR] 3.29; P = .028) and EFS (HR 2.49; P = .029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that an aggressive transplant approach should be considered first in patients with TL and emphasize the need to incorporate novel strategies (eg, immunomodulation) early post-SCT to prevent relapses as disease recurrence remains the major cause of failure in heavily pretreated patients </plain></SENT>
