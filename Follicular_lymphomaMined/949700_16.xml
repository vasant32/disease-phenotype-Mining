<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many investigators have regarded Stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> as a generalized form of disease and have accordingly recommended systemic treatment programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 1961 and 1973, 68 patients with clinical or pathologic Stage III non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were seen in the Division of Radiation Therapy at Stanford University Medical Center and were treated by high dose (3500 rads or more) total lymphoid radiation therapy only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 17 patients who had a diffuse histologic pattern, the actuarial survival at 5 years was 39%, but only three patients have remained free of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, for the 51 patients who had a nodular histologic pattern, the actuarial survivals at 5 and 10 years were 75% and 65%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Corresponding relapse-free survivals for patients with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were 43% and 33%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 28 patients who relapsed with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 18 (64%) had relapses confined to lymph nodes; six of these were extensions to previously unirradiated epitrochlear-brachial nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven of the 18 patients were treated only with further conventional external radiation therapy at the time of their relapses and remain free of disease for additional periods of 2 to 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hence, 30 of 51 (59%) patients with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> have thus far been controlled by high dose total lymphoid irradiation only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Over 90% of relapses among patients with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were seen within the first 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that high dose conventional radiation therapy to incorporate not only the routine total lymphoid fields but also the epitrochlear, mesenteric, and Waldeyer's ring region has curative potential even in Stage III non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, especially in the nodular group </plain></SENT>
