<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 45 patients with follicular grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who were treated with rituximab and the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHOP) at The University of Texas MD Anderson <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Response rate, failure-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e>), and overall survival (OS) were estimated and a historical comparison to CHOP-only-treated patients was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The International Prognostic Index (IPI) distribution was 47% low, 36% low intermediate, 13% high intermediate, and 4% high risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The complete response rate was 96% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-four of 45 patients are still alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up for the alive patients is 3.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 3-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> rate according to the IPI was 80% [95% confidence interval (CI) 64% to 100%] in low, 81% in low intermediate (95% CI 64% to 100%), and 50% (95% CI 25% to 100%) in high-intermediate/high-risk patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The addition of rituximab to CHOP improved both 5-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e>, 71% (95% CI 58% to 87%) compared with 44% (95% CI 36% to 55%) with P value of 0.019, and 5-year OS, 98% (95% CI 93% to 100%) compared with 75% (95% CI 67% to 84%) with P value of 0.0034 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The addition of rituximab to CHOP provided a high response rate and excellent early survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Poor-risk patients continue to demonstrate a high rate of failure despite the use of rituximab </plain></SENT>
