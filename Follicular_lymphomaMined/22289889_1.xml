<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence indicates that infiltrating stromal cells contribute directly and indirectly to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> in a wide range of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), malignant B cells are found admixed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> lymphoid-like stromal cells within invaded lymph nodes and BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) support in vitro FL B-cell survival, in particular after their engagement toward lymphoid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show here that BM-MSCs obtained from patients with FL (FL-MSCs) display a specific gene expression profile compared with MSCs obtained from healthy age-matched donors (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-MSCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This FL-MSC signature is significantly enriched for genes associated with a lymphoid-like commitment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, CCL2 could be detected at a high level within the FL-cell niche, is up-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-MSCs by coculture with malignant B cells, and is overexpressed by FL-MSCs, in agreement with their capacity to recruit monocytes more efficiently than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-MSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, FL-MSCs and macrophages cooperate to sustain malignant B-cell growth, whereas FL-MSCs drive monocyte differentiation toward a proangiogenic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi>-unresponsive phenotype close to that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Altogether, these results highlight the complex role of FL stromal cells that promote direct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> B-cell growth and orchestrate FL-cell niche, thus emerging as a potential therapeutic target in this disease </plain></SENT>
