<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The detection of characteristic genomic aberrations by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has a high diagnostic impact on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> according to the World Health Organization (WHO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the reproducibility of non-isotopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> results a multicenter trial was carried out involving eight institutes for hematopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Analyses were performed on two diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) without known aberrations, on one follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with a IGH/BCL2 translocation and BCL6 split and on two B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> intermediate between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with c-MYC and BCL2 rearrangements, one with an additional BCL6 split </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Break-apart probes for BCL6 and c-MYC, as well as fusion probes for the c-MYC/IGH and the IGH/BCL2 translocations were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> aberrations were correctly detected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> centres and no false positive or false negative results were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The numbers of positive cells varied from 25% to 94% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pearson's correlation coefficient between the centres was always &gt;â€‰0.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> analysis of recurrent genomic aberrations in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue is a highly reproducible technique which yields substantial additive help for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnostics </plain></SENT>
