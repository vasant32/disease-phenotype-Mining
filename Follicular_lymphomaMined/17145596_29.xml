<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated macrophages (TAM) is a prognostic factor for survival in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overexpression and/or activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) in these TAM have also been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the extent to which macrophages are present in FL and to investigate the expression of STAT1 in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 211 patients with distinct stages and grades of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of the CD68 proteins, chosen as a marker for macrophages, and STAT1 was quantified by immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Automated determinations revealed the presence of CD68-positive macrophages in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FL tissues studied (mean 57.6+/-45.1 cells/field), while STAT1 protein was expressed in 29.94% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Double-fluorescence staining confirmed that STAT1 protein co-localized exclusively with CD68, indicating the presence of a subset of STAT1-expressing TAM localized principally in the vicinity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that, besides the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) classification, expression of STAT1 was an important independent prognostic factor for shorter overall survival in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the presence of STAT1-expressing TAM in FL and their association with an adverse outcome, thus emphasizing the relevance of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in the control of the growth and survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
