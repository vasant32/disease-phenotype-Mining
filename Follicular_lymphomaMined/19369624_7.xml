<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A prior study reported that splenic FLs frequently lack BCL2 expression, further complicating diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined 16 cases of splenic FL, including 12 cases initially diagnosed at splenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two morphologic patterns were identified: one with architectural abnormalities (AA) and one with an extensive architectural preservation (AP) pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Newly diagnosed AP cases were associated with older age (P = .051) and grade 1 histologic features (P = .023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases displayed a CD10+/BCL2+ phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetics and FISH identified IGH/BCL2 or BCL6 translocations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tested cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Splenic FLs display phenotypic and cytogenetic findings similar to nodal FLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, splenic FLs frequently display an exclusively intrafollicular growth pattern resembling so-called in situ FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recognition of subtle FL with preserved architecture is important because patients may have overt FL at other sites or the FL may progress to overt nodal disease </plain></SENT>
