<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The addition of rituximab to chemotherapy improves the overall response rate, prolongs the response duration and the overall survival both in patients with follicular and other indolent CD20 positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Maintenance treatment with rituximab in patients with indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> further prolongs the remission duration, and some of the studies have also shown survival benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the maintenance therapy in aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> most probably gives no further improvement in patients, who have received rituximab already in the induction treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rituximab has been used at the Institute of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Ljubljana since 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the period from 2004 to 2006, we have treated 340 patients with rituximab either as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our treatment group included 46.8% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> and 19.4% with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In majority of the patients, rituximab was given as the first-line treatment (54.4%), while 26.2% of patients received it as the second-line treatment and 19.4% of patients as the third or subsequent line of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among patients with indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, just 15% received rituximab as the first-line treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, 75.9% of patients with aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were treated with rituximab for newly diagnosed disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>About 67.4% of patients were treated with R-CHOP combination, while the others received different rituximab-chemotherapy combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate regardless of the histological type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was 78.8%, and the highest response rate was achieved in patients with aggressive follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (91.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The highest overall response rate was observed when rituximab was given as the first-line treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> types except the mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (66.6% overall response rate for the first-line treatment versus 73.7% overall response rate for the second-line treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 75% of patients regardless of the histological type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the response lasted more than 12 months; the median response duration has not been reached yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In patients receiving rituximab as the first-line treatment, the median response duration also has not been reached yet, while for the second-line treatment, it was 25 months and for the third or subsequent line, 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The longest disease-free survival was observed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The overall survival rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients regardless of the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was 75% 26 months after the beginning of the treatment, and the median overall survival has not been reached yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>When analyzed by the lines of treatment-the median overall survival has not been reached in any line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The longest overall survival was observed in patients with indolent follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The treatment results with rituximab at the Institute of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Ljubljana are comparable to the results of larger randomized trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>According to the beneficial influence of rituximab on the long-term prognosis of patients with CD20 positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, it became the standard of treatment in these patients </plain></SENT>
