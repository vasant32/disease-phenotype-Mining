<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conflicting reports were published regarding the role of various growth factors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells mobilization, hence we studied the extent of CD34(+) cells and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell mobilization in 35 non-Hodgkin's (NHL) patients primed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (Cy) in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) (A, 13 patients), granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF (B, 10 patients), or GM-CSF followed by G-CSF (C, 12 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD34(+) cells were quantitated by flow cytometry and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells by the TaqMan Real Time PCR for bcl-2 gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Successful collection in 4 days of &gt; or = 2 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg needed for prompt engraftment was obtained in 76%, 60%, and 58% of patients in arms A, B, and C, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> cell mobilization was detected in 35% patients tested, 78% of which had follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> cell mobilization was similar in the three arms of the study, however, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells was prevalent in patients who failed to mobilize the amount of 0.4 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg in 2 days ("poor mobilizers") and reached 42%, compared to 17% in the "successful mobilizers" group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> cell contamination in PBSCs was detected proportionately in the peripheral blood and in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that bcl-2 gene rearrangement is prevalent in patients with follicular histology, and, in these patients, an inverse relationship was observed between mobilization of CD34(+) cells and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results explain the high relative risk (1.98) for mobilization in patients with follicular histology </plain></SENT>
