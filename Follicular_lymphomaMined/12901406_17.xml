<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred six consecutive patients with pancreatic masses, consisting of 83 ductal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, 7 endocrine <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, 5 intraductal papillary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1334811" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mucinous tumors</z:e>, 3 cases of autoimmune-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo>, 3 solid pseudopapillary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, 2 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006280'>chronic pancreatitis</z:hpo>, 1 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_305'>serous cystadenoma</z:mpath>, 1 osteoclastoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017525" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">giant cell tumor</z:e>, and 1 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, were examined by contrast-enhanced sonography with coded harmonic imaging in a phase inversion harmonic technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The contrast enhancement patterns were assessed, and specimens removed during pancreatectomy were subjected to pathologic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Internal tumoral vascularity was detected in 47 (56.6%) of the 83 ductal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vascular image spreading and homogeneous staining throughout the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of the 5 intraductal papillary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1334811" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mucinous tumors</z:e> were positive for enhancement effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enhancement effects were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 cases of autoimmune-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo>, but the degree varied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between the intensity of enhancement effects and the ratio of patent vessels in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vascularity was detected by contrast-enhanced sonography in only about half of the ductal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, confirming the difficulty in distinguishing those <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from other <z:mp ids='MP_0009153'>pancreatic tumors</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a correlation between the patency of the vessels in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and their vascularity </plain></SENT>
