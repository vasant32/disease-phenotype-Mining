<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a series of 20 non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) in which cytogenetic analysis showed a translocation involving band 3q27 and the site of one of the three Ig genes (14q32, 2p12, 22q11) in the neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cases were found in a series of 319 patients with clonal chromosomal abnormalities studied over a 7-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mainly of large cell type and the remaining six were follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases studied were of B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A t(3;14)(q27;q32) was commonest, found in 15 patients (4.7%), with the two variant translocations, t(3;22)(q27;q11) and t(2;3)(p12;q27), being found in three and two patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional chromosomal defects were present in most patients, but two patients had this type of translocation as the sole abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that translocations involving band 3q27 and Ig genes are not uncommon, and suggest that a novel oncogene, located at band 3q27, may be implicated in B-cell NHL </plain></SENT>
