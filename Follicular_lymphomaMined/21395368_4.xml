<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FcγRIIIA-158 V/F gene polymorphism results in expression of 3 variants of the FcγRIIIA receptor (FcγRIIIA) on cytotoxic lymphocytes with different receptor affinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 102 patients with newly diagnosed FL to assess whether the FcγRIIIA genotype influences outcome in patients treated with risk-adapted immunochemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age was 52 years (31-84); 90% of the patients had advanced (III/IV) clinical stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) scores were as follows: low 18.9%, intermediate 33.7% and high 47.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The front-line treatment was stratified according to the commonly used risk factors (FLIPI, beta-2-microglobuline and serum-Tyrosine-Kinase levels, bulky disease) into 3 treatment groups: (1) patients with FLIPI 0-1 treated with (R)-CHOP (51%), (2) patients under 60 (65) years of age with intermediate-risk disease (FLIPI 2) indicated for an intensive protocol (ProMACE-CytaBOM or sequential chemotherapy) (21%), and (3) patients under 60 (65) years with high-risk disease (FLIPI ≥3) treated with intensive chemotherapy plus autologous stem cell transplantation (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rituximab was added to front-line chemotherapy in 59% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Generally, complete remission (CR) or unconfirmed CR was achieved in 85% of the patients, 11% had partial remission and 4% stable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molecular CR (CRm) was achieved in 67.4% of 86 evaluable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (OS) at 5 years reached 84% (95% CI 0.74-0.93); event-free survival (EFS) at 5 years was 58% (95% CI 0.45-0.71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of FcγRIIIA-158 gene polymorphisms V/V, V/F and F/F were 8%, 50% and 42%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The FLIPI score distribution was not different in F/F patients as compared to V/F+V/V carriers (chi-square, P=0.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The treatment modalities (treatment arm or rituximab administration) had the same distribution in V/V+V/F vs F/F patients (chi-square, P=0.16 and P=0.62, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The CRm rates were similar in both subgroups of V/V+V/F vs F/F patients (chi-square, P=0.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Survival curves for OS and EFS were not significantly different when comparing the subgroups of V/V+V/F vs F/F patients (P=0.28 and P=0.57, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We found no difference in the quality of treatment response or survival after front-line immunochemotherapy between FcγRIIIA subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>FcγRIIIA polymorphism have no influence on the outcome of patients treated with risk-adapted chemotherapy with or without rituximab </plain></SENT>
