<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complementing these efforts, we conducted human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and class II genotyping among 610 NHL cases and 555 controls of non-Hispanic white descent from a US multicenter study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Allele-disease associations were assessed by logistic regression for NHL and its subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant associations between HLA and NHL subtypes include HLA-DRB1*0101 for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR] = 2.14, P &lt; .001), HLA-DRB1*0401 for diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>; OR = 0.45, P = .006), and HLA-DRB1*13 and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR = 0.48, P = .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further observed significant heterozygote advantage for HLA class I alleles and NHL, and particularly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (P trend = .01 for elevated risk with increasing number of homozygous alleles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results support a role for HLA in the etiology of NHL and its subtypes </plain></SENT>
