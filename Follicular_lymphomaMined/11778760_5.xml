<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objective of this multiinstitutional study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rituximab at standard four weekly doses in patients with recurrent indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight patients entered into this study, 63% had follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 61% had an IPI score of 2 or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median disease duration was 3 yr, median number of prior treatments was three, and 66% of patients responded to the immediate past treatment with a median remission duration of 3 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 158 antibody doses were given, including two patients who received two courses of four infusions each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> after the second dose and required assisted ventilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no immediate relationship to the antibody infusion and no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This complication resolved and the patient successfully completed the full course of the antibody treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Another patient discontinued therapy after the second dose owing to intolerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and painful <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty percent of the first, and 20% of subsequent rituximab infusions were associated with infusion-related reactions including mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, chills, and occasional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin eruptions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complete and partial responses were achieved in 24% and 35% of 34 evaluable patients, respectively, for an overall response rate of 59% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median time to progression/relapse in responding patients was 16 mo (95% CI, 6.4, 25.6) compared with a median of 3 mo duration of response to the immediate previous therapy in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Longer response duration post rituximab monotherapy than with previous treatment in this series of heavily pretreated patients suggests a major role for the antibody in the therapy of patients with indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
