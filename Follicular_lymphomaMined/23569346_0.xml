<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBE</z:chebi> cannot be safely performed in cases with passage disturbance due to wall thickening and stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, video capsule endoscopy cannot be performed in such cases because of the risk of retention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we report 4 cases of primary follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the gastrointestinal tract that could be detected using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET-CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The endoscopic findings of these 4 cases included lesions with wall thickening, which comprised macroscopically clusters of nodules, dense clusters of whitish granules or small nodules, fold thickening and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> with irregular margins that occupied the whole lumen with edematous mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients fulfilled the World Health Organization grade 1 criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET-CT can help predict the risks that may result from certain endoscopic examinations, such as <z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBE</z:chebi> and video capsule endoscopy </plain></SENT>
