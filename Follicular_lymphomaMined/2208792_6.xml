<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two new monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), UCL3D3 and UCL4D12 were obtained following immunization with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (UCL3D3) or low-grade primary B cell gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (UCL4D12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> splenic white pulp, tonsil and small intestinal Peyer's patches, UCL4D12 recognizes marginal zone B cells and a subpopulation of follicle centre cells, whereas mantle zone B cells are UCL4D12 negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, UCL3D3 recognizes mantle zone B cells and follicular dendritic cells, but not marginal zone B cells or follicle centre B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Double-immunofluorescence studies showed that in the splenic white pulp, these antibodies stain reciprocally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of UCL3D3+ cells are sIgM+ and sIgD+ whereas a higher proportion of UCL4D12+ cells express surface IgM (sIgM) but not surface IgD (sIgD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Less than 10% of splenic B cells express both 3D3 and 4D12 antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the cell lines tested expressed either antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Functional studies showed that both antigens play a role in B cell activation as the MoAbs increase the mitogenic effect of Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I on tonsil B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect was maximal at 72 h in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> activation was reduced, and no effect was observed with anti-immunoglobulin (anti mu) or CDw40 (G28.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>UCL3D3 and UCL4D12 did not show any stimulatory effect on their own </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Biochemical studies show that both MoAbs recognize proteins of 80-90 kD under reducing conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These two MoAbs appear to recognize new B cell surface antigens which may be useful for identifying subpopulations of B cells </plain></SENT>
