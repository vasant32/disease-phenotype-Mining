<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-two patients with NHL were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on histology, 49 of the patients had follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 23 had other lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The response was assessed at 8-12 weeks after RIT-Z injection with PET/CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response rate was 85 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven (60 %) patients achieved complete remission, 16 (26 %) had partial remission, 4 (6 %) had stable disease, and 5 (8 %) had progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between the response to RIT-Z, frequency of chemotherapy, and history of prior treatment with fludarabine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in efficacy according to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> type, years since last chemotherapy, patient age, or disease stage at RIT-Z </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> of grade 4 was significantly correlated with disease stage at RIT-Z and history of prior treatment with fludarabine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was also no significant correlation between hematotoxicity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> type, frequency of chemotherapy, years since last chemotherapy, patient age, or history of bone marrow transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> was significantly correlated with frequency of chemotherapy, history of bone marrow transplant, and history of prior treatment with fludarabine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The response rate was high, and we were able to decrease the hematologic side effects by using RIT-Z earlier </plain></SENT>
