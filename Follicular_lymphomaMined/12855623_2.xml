<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have performed a prospective study of the molecular behavior of 35 patients with follicular non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> chemotherapy in conjunction with IFN-alpha 2b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experimental Design: Bcl-2 and clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangements were assayed at diagnosis by PCR in lymph node and bone marrow (BM) and sequentially after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Molecular markers were detected in BM of 29 (83%) patients at diagnosis: Bcl-2 rearrangement in 20 patients (90% major breakpoint and 10% minor cluster) and clonal IgH rearrangement in 9 of 15 patients negative for Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular and clinical response was noted in 25 (86%) patients after induction treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival at 5 years was 78.1 +/- 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A correlation between clinical and molecular response was found in 24 patients with molecular markers in BM at diagnosis and &gt;2 years of follow-up: 94% of patients with undetectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> showed continuous clinical remission, whereas 50% of patients who reverted back to positive molecular markers relapsed (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rate of molecular response is high in patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and IFN and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> sequential analysis is useful for disease surveillance </plain></SENT>
