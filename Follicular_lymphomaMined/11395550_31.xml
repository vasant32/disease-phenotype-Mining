<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cutaneous follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs) and cutaneous B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of extranodal marginal zone (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>)/mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type may have morphologic overlap, despite the fact that they are thought to be of distinct derivation (germinal center vs. postgerminal center) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The problem is compounded by the reported absence of bcl-2 expression by many cutaneous FLs, leading to speculation that cutaneous FL may be unrelated to nodal FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors analyzed the expression of the germinal center-associated antigens bcl-6 and CD10 and of bcl-2 in 18 cutaneous B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (10 FLs and eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZLs</z:e>), in relationship to CD21+ follicular structures, to clarify the relationship of nodal to cutaneous FLs and to explore the value of these antigens in differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors studied 10 cutaneous FLs (seven primary and three secondary) and eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZLs</z:e> (six primary and two secondary) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The FLs (found in six men and four women age 45-75 years) involved the trunk (n = 3) and scalp, face and neck (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZLs</z:e> (found in five women and three men age 34-81 years) involved the trunk (n = 4), face and neck (n = 2), and arm (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining for CD21, bcl-6, CD10, and bcl-2 allowed the delineation of compartments within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and yielded distinct patterns of staining in FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both follicular and interfollicular/diffuse areas of FL the neoplastic cells were bcl-6+ (10 of 10), often CD10+ (seven of 10, four of seven primary), and bcl-2+ (nine of 10, six of seven primary) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only three of seven cases (one of five primary) had bcl-2 rearrangement detectable by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZLs</z:e>, the neoplastic B-cells were bcl-6-, CD10-, and bcl-2+ (eight of eight) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patterns of CD21+ follicles were identified in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>: reactive germinal centers, uniformly bcl-6+, CD10+, and bcl-2- (five of eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZLs</z:e>); colonized follicles, both bcl-6-, bcl-2+, and L26+ cells, and bcl-6+ and bcl-2- cells (five of eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZLs</z:e>); and expanded/colonized follicular dendritic cell meshworks, bcl-6- and bcl-2+ B cells with rare residual bcl-6+ and bcl-2- cells (four of eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZLs</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that cutaneous FLs express bcl-6 uniformly, usually express CD10 and bcl-2, and have a follicular pattern similar to nodal FL and consistent with a germinal center origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotype of cutaneous FL is distinct from that of cutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>, which is negative for bcl-6 and CD10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Colonized follicles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>, identified by CD21+ follicular dendritic cell meshworks, contained numerous bcl-6- and bcl-2+ B cells, and were readily distinguished from neoplastic follicles in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Conversely, CD21- interfollicular and diffuse areas in FLs contained bcl-6+ and CD10+ cells, which were not seen in diffuse areas of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thus, the combination of bcl-2, bcl-6, and CD21 staining is useful for the distinction of cutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> from cutaneous FL </plain></SENT>
