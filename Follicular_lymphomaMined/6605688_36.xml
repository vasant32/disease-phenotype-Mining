<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Leu-1 antigen has been defined by monoclonal antibodies (L17F12, T101, and OKT-1) as a pan-T-cell antigen present on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> human peripheral blood T cells and thymocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although originally thought to be confined to T-cell lineage, some cases of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> have been found to react with these antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a frozen section immunoperoxidase staining technique, 125 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with B-cell differentiation were examined for the presence of Leu-1 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Leu-1 antigen was detected in 4 of 11 cases of diffuse small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Rappaport's DWDL) and 3 of 4 cases of diffuse intermediate lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> less often expressed this antigen--2 of 29 cases of the small cleaved cell type (Rappaport's NPDL), none of 13 cases of mixed small cleaved and large cell type (Rappaport's NM), and 1 of 6 cases of large cell type (Rappaport's NH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of presumed follicular center cell origin expressed this antigen infrequently as well--1 of 3 cases of the small cleaved cell type (Rappaport's DPDL), neither of 2 cases of mixed small cleaved and large cell type (Rappaport's DM), and 3 of 43 of large cell type (cleaved/noncleaved) (Rappaport's DH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large cell, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of B-cell type expressed Leu-1 in 1 of 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the 3 cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or of the three small noncleaved non-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Rappaport's undifferentiated) expressed detectable Leu-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>B-lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1 case) and B-cell unclassified <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1 case) both failed to express detectable Leu-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It appears that this pan-T-cell antigen is mainly found on those B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> composed predominantly of small lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This finding may be of use in distinguishing extranodal neoplastic collections of small lymphocytes from lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasias</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
