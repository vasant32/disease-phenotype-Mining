<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied deletions of GSTM1 and GSTT1, and the GSTP1 Ile(105)Val polymorphism in 89 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with a GSTM1 or GSTT1 deletion had a significantly worse event-free survival, when compared with patients with undeleted genotype (p = 0.03 and p = 0.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome was even worse in patients with a double negative genotype, in comparison with patients with only one GST deletion or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> genotype (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, the GSTM1/GSTT1 genotype tended to have a prognostic significance independent from the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In particular, GSTM1/T1 deletions identified patients with negative prognosis in the low (&lt;3) FLIPI score group (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Larger prospective studies including homogeneously treated patients will be needed to confirm these results </plain></SENT>
