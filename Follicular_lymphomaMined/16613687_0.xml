<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of rituximab-containing regimens for patients with indolent B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From Mar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>1999 to Jan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2005, 34 patients with indolent B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> received rituximab-containing regimens with a median of 5 cycles (ranged from 3 to 8 cycles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 34 patients, 2 received rituximab alone, and 32 received rituximab-based regimens, which including CHOP (16 cases), FMD (5 cases), CHOPE (4 cases), EPOCH (2 cases), DICE (2 cases), DAHP (2 cases), and FN (1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 34 patients, 30 were evaluable for objective response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall response (OR) rate was 93.3%, and the complete response (CR) rate was 60.0%; the OR rate and CR rate of 22 evaluable naive patients were 95.4% and 66.7%, those of 18 evaluable follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients were 88.9% and 66.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 17 months (4-68 months), the 1-year progression-freely survival rate was 85.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Myelosuppression</z:e> was the major adverse event: 19 patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> with 4 cases of grade III-IV event, 5 suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> with 4 cases of grade III-IV event, and 2 suffered from febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other adverse events included grade I-II <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo>, and transient liver function abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The infusional reaction of rituximab consisted of grade I-II rigor/febrile, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo>, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, and asymptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature beat</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Rituximab-containing chemotherapeutic regimens are effective for indolent B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with mild toxicity </plain></SENT>
