<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This investigational agent consists of recombinant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-specific immunoglobulin (idiotype [Id]) chemically conjugated to the highly immunogenic carrier protein keyhole limpet haemocyanin (Id-KLH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The vaccine product is administered by subcutaneous co-injection with the cytokine adjuvant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) with the goal of stimulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-specific T cell and humoral immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic Id vaccines have shown promising results in early phase clinical trials in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and several Phase III trials are ongoing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FavId's advantages over other Id vaccine formulations include its rapid and efficient manufacturing technology utilising recombinant baculovirus, with a production time of only 8-12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Phase II studies, FavId Id-KLH plus GM-CSF vaccines have been found to be safe, immunogenic and clinically active in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At present, FavId is being tested in a randomised, placebo-controlled Phase III trial in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, aimed at improving the time to disease progression when administered following cytoreduction with rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If found to be efficacious in this pivotal trial, FavId would represent a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-selective immunotherapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with little toxicity and a novel mechanism of action </plain></SENT>
