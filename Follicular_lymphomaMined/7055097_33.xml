<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Morphologic subclassifications have been proposed with a presumptive relationship to immunologic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six histologic types were studied, four of presumed follicular origin (large cleaved, large non-cleaved, mixed follicular center cell, and blastic) and two of presumed nonfollicular origin (pleomorphic pyroninophilic and pleomorphic convoluted) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of these follicular subtypes were found to be associated with the frequent presence of B-cell markers; large non-cleaved, six of seven; and blastic, four of six </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, four of nine T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were misclassified as lesions of follicular center cell type, indicating the difficulty of distinguishing some convoluted cells of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from irregularly cleaved cells of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pleomorphic pyroninophilic or B-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was associated with B-cell markers in only two of six cases; two additional cases had T-cell markers, one had histiocytic markers and in one case, no markers were demonstrable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, this <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> may reflect a common pathway of transformed lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some cases of T-cell origin could be recognized by the striking pleomorphic convoluted histology (three of five cases) but morphologic overlap with pleomorphic B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, particularly transformed nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, posed a problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This histopathologic subclassification correctly predicted immunologic phenotype in only 61% of cases, suggesting that in diffuse non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, histologic appearance alone may not be a reliable indicator of immunologic surface markers </plain></SENT>
