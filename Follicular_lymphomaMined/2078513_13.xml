<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to determine if BCL1 rearrangement is associated with a particular subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we analysed 131 B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples by Southern blot analysis, using a BCL1 probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The BCL1 locus was rearranged in 9 out of 25 (36%) cases of intermediate lymphocytic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (ILL), in 1 out of 8 cases of diffuse small cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, in 1 out of 12 cases of diffuse mixed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and in 1 out of 21 cases of diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, BCL1 was never found rearranged in any of the 46 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BCL2 gene was in germ-line configuration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ILL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sequential hybridization of Southern blots with JH, C mu, and BCLI probes identified comigrating fragments in only one case of ILL, which suggests that, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the other cases, either the rearrangement of BCL1 did not result from a t(11;14) translocation or the break on chromosome 14 occurred outside the JH or C mu regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that rearrangement of the BCL1 locus may be closely associated with ILL and could be considered as a genotypic marker of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
