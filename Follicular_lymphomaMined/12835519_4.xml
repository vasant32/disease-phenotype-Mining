<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in areas where the prevalence of HCV is low, this association has not been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to established the prevalence of HCV in patients with B-cell malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study was performed in 416 patients with new, previously untreated B-cell malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (236 diffuse large cell [DLC], 97 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 83 marginal B-cell zone malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) and 1902 cases (682 first-degree relatives, 832 healthy blood donors, and 408 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e>); furthermore, 353 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> associated to HCV were the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found a prevalence of 0.48 positive HCV among malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 0.12 for healthy blood donors, 0 in first-degree relatives, and 0.56 in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e>, that were statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio was 1.86 and its confidence interval included the equality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> and HCV developed malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in a median follow-up of 7.9 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We felt that the presence of HCV is not significant in the development of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and that reports of high prevalence were associated also to a high prevalence of HCV in the general population and this association will be considered hazardous </plain></SENT>
