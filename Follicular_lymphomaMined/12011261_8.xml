<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) is a distinct type of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) characterized by the t(11;14)(q13;q32), in which the ccnd1 gene is juxtaposed with the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene, resulting in up-regulation of cyclin D1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cyclin D1 overexpression is a useful finding that supports the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used a 5' --&gt; 3' exonuclease-based real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method to quantify cyclin D1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in 108 B-cell NHL and nonneoplastic specimens, including 25 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17138">Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was also quantified to normalize cyclin D1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels, and the data were expressed as a cyclin D1 to GAPDH ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At each anatomic site, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> cases had higher cyclin D1 levels than other types of NHL or nonneoplastic specimens, without overlap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For example, in lymph node specimens, the median cyclin D1/GAPDH ratio was 147 (range, 94-160) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, compared with 8.6 (range, 4-18) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; 5.8 (range, 1.8-24) in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; 4.8 in one case of marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; and 20.2 (range, 5.8-44) in reactive specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> cases had significantly higher cyclin D1 levels than other groups (P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In peripheral blood specimens involved by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, cyclin D1 levels correlated with extent of involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that this real-time RT-PCR method to quantify cyclin D1 expression is helpful in distinguishing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> from other types of B-cell NHL and from nonneoplastic specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This method is rapid, can be applied to the analysis of fluid specimens, and obviates the need for time-consuming and laborious detection methods that are required by traditional semi-quantitative RT-PCR methods </plain></SENT>
