<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The growth of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> can be influenced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-immune system interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) is a negative regulator of T-cell activation that serves to dampen antitumor immune responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blocking anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies improves host resistance to immunogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, and the anti-CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab (MDX-010) has clinical activity against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>, prostate, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We did a phase I trial of ipilimumab in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to evaluate safety, immunologic activity, and potential clinical efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg and then monthly at 1 mg/kg x 3 months (dose level 1), with subsequent escalation to 3 mg/kg monthly x 4 months (dose level 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen patients were treated, 12 at the lower dose level and 6 at the higher dose level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ipilimumab was generally well tolerated, with common adverse events attributed to it, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients had clinical responses; one patient with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had an ongoing complete response (&gt;31 months), and one with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had a partial response lasting 19 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 5 of 16 cases tested (31%), T-cell proliferation to recall antigens was significantly increased (&gt;2-fold) after ipilimumab therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Blockade of CTLA-4 signaling with the use of ipilimumab is well tolerated at the doses used and has antitumor activity in patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation of ipilimumab alone or in combination with other agents in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients is therefore warranted </plain></SENT>
