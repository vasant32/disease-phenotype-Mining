<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicular dendritic cells (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi>) in reactive germinal centres (GCs) show modulated expression of antigens indicative of step-wise maturation from more undifferentiated stroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study compared the expression of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> markers CD21, CD23, CD35, and chemokine CXCL13 and the stromal markers low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (LNGFR) and CNA.42 in 35 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) cases with reactive lymphoic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CXCL13 was expressed by follicular stroma in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FLs but most cases showed either partial (11/35 cases, 31%) or complete (10/35 cases, 29%) absence of other <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> antigens, most commonly CD23, followed by CD21 and CD35, with variable patterns of LNGFR and CNA.42 immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only a minority of FL cases (14/35, 40%) showed stroma that resembled mature <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> (CD23+, CD21+, CD35+) and these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were always associated with numerous intrafollicular T-cells, similar to reactive GCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the 25 FL cases that had identifiable extrafollicular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells, the immunophenotype of follicular stroma showed the same variability but the extrafollicular stroma showed an absence of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> markers, with the exception of frequent strong LNGFR staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stromal phenotypic changes in FL were not correlated with mean follicle size, percentage of diffuse growth, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> mitotic rate or the proliferation index as determined by PCNA immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serial biopsy specimens analysed in a subset of 15 patients showed either a stable stromal phenotype (seven cases, 47%) or loss of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> antigens in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-associated stroma over time (seven cases, 47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The GC-like subset of FLs, having both abundant intrafollicular T-cells and fully differentiated CD23+ <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi>, comprises a minority of FL cases that likely have different growth requirements from FLs that lack these features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pattern of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> antigen loss in stroma of FL is a readily assessable biological feature that appears independent of architectural growth pattern and may serve as a useful surrogate marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
