<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At a first lymph node biopsy, a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> was made on the basis of the presence of vague neoplastic nodules, consisting of small lymphoid cells and small cleaved cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At a second lymph node biopsy, nodules of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were observed in the central zones of the vague neoplastic nodules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At a third biopsy, the central zones were found to expand, revealing FL dominant pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The progress of FL from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> also was suggested by sIg, AIPase, anti-CALLA (common <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> antigen) antibody, and anti-DRC (dendritic reticulum cell) antibody findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consequently, this is suggested to be a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> of B-lymphocytes differentiating from small lymphocytes in the primary follicle or the mantle zone of secondary follicle into germinal center cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The anti-DRC antibody findings suggest the neoplastic cells of FL induce DRC as the neoplastic stroma </plain></SENT>
