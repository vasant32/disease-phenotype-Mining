<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to examine the genetics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) and to identify genetic alterations associated with disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 100 biopsies from 44 patients diagnosed with t(14;18)-positive FL were examined by array comparative genomic hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 20 patients the patterns of somatic hypermutations (SHMs) in the variable region of heavy chain gene were additionally analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gain of chromosome X in male samples was a marker for poor outcome (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gains involving chromosome 2, 3q, and 5 were exclusively present in FL biopsies from cases with higher grade transformation and were among the copy number alterations (CNAs) associated with inferior survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although we noted a trend for increasing genomic complexity in initial versus late FL samples, the overall frequencies of CNAs in initial and late FL biopsies showed a surprisingly stable pattern through the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 27 of cases the initial samples harbored CNAs that were absent in relapse samples, indicating that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell clones at relapse were not direct descendants of initially dominating clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pattern of SHMs confirmed parallel development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell clones in 14 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the hypothesis of common progenitor cells in FL </plain></SENT>
