<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the benefit of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy, identify prognostic factors, and determine the value of the International Prognostic Factors Index for patients with follicular large-cell (FLC) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study includes 96 patients with FLC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated at Stanford University Medical Center between 1969 and 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>-containing chemotherapy regimens, 21 patients received other chemotherapy regimens, 15 patients received radiotherapy only, and five patients received no initial therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients had stage I or II disease and 62 patients had stage III or IV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With a median follow-up duration of 5.2 years (range, 1 to 18), the actuarial 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 75% and 54%, with actuarial 5- and 10-year freedom from progression (FFP) rates of 53% and 42%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with chemotherapy regimens that contained both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> had a superior actuarial 10-year FFP rate (55% v 25%, P = .06) and overall survival rate (65% v 42%, P = .04) compared with patients treated with other chemotherapy regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one patient treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> relapsed after 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, discordant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and treatment with chemotherapy regimens not containing both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> predicted for worse FFP and overall survival rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, poor performance status and increasing areas of diffuse histology predicted for a worse survival, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and male sex predicted for a worse FFP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The age-specific International Index was useful in predicting outcome; however, few patients with FLC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had high-risk features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The plateau in FFP implies that patients with FLC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> enjoy sustained remissions after standard <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>FLC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> should continue to be approached as an intermediate-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with curative intent </plain></SENT>
