<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine consecutive patients with indolent NHL of the hard palate were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The palate was a site of initial disease for six patients (four stage IAE and two stage IIIAE) and of relapse for three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were four cases of grade 1-2 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), two of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) and three of marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> nine patients received involved site radiation therapy (RT) alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no grade â‰¥ 3 toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 55 months, 5-year freedom from local progression was 100%, disease-free survival was 38% and overall survival was 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, involved site RT is well tolerated and provides excellent local control in the management of indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the hard palate </plain></SENT>
