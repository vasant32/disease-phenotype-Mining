<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we identify 120 genes whose expression patterns differed between reactive lymph node tissue and three types of SBCL: follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whereas previously published studies have generally analyzed the gene expression profiles of one type of SBCL, work presented in this paper was intended to identify genes that are differentially expressed between three SBCL subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This analysis was performed using <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> pooled from multiple specimens representing each tissue type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to validate the differential expression of 23 of these genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 23 validated genes were cyclin D1 (CCND1) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023434" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BCLL">B-cell CLL</z:e>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 2, which have well-known roles in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining 21 genes have no currently established role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using qRT-PCR, the expression of CCND1 and seven additional genes was further studied in a panel of individual specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genes identified in this study are of biological interest and represent candidate diagnostic markers </plain></SENT>
