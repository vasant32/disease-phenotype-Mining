<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DNA was extracted from paraffin wax embedded, formalin fixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> specimens, and junctional sequences of rearranged chromosomes were amplified by the PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The products were used as templates for asymmetrical PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, direct sequence analysis was performed using the chain termination method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded biopsy specimens and PCR amplification could be used to determine the nucleotide sequences of junctional regions of rearranged chromosomes t(14;18) from patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The identification of junctional sequences of the translocation in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> provides a molecular "fingerprint" of t(14;18) of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of an individual patient and can be used for the detection of clone specific DNA in any biopsy tissue obtained from the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The strategy used for rapid sequence analysis of PCR amplified DNA sequences will be useful in many areas of molecular pathology </plain></SENT>
