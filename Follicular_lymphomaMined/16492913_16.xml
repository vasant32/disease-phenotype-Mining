<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The reasons for the positive association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007114" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">skin cancer</z:e> and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are not known but may be due to common susceptibility involving suboptimal DNA repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated selected polymorphisms and haplotypes in three DNA repair genes, previously associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007114" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">skin cancer</z:e> and DNA repair capacity, in risk of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, including possible gene interaction with cigarette smoking and sun exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We genotyped 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the ERCC2, XRCC1, and XRCC3 genes in 430 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients and 605 controls within a population-based case-control study in Denmark and Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using unconditional logistic regression and haplotype associations were assessed with a global score test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed no associations between variation in the ERCC2 and XRCC1 genes and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In XRCC3, increased risk of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was suggested for rare homozygotes of three SNPs [Rs3212024: OR, 1.8 (95% CI, 1.1-2.8); Rs3212038: OR, 1.5 (95% CI, 1.0-2.4); Rs3212090: OR, 1.5 (95% CI, 1.0-2.5)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results were strengthened in current cigarette smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, evidence of differences in XRCC3 haplotype distributions between follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases and controls was weak, both overall and in current smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that polymorphic variation in the XRCC3 gene, but not in ERCC2 or XRCC1, may be of importance for susceptibility to follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, perhaps primarily in current smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The link between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007114" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">skin cancer</z:e> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is unlikely to be mediated through common variation in the studied DNA repair gene polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
