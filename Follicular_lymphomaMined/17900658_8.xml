<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gene promoter hypermethylation is an alternative mechanism of gene inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the methylation status of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor components of the INK4/Rb pathway in mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction for p15, p16, p18, and Rb1 in 23 mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 30 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction results showed that in mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, frequent p16 (82%) but infrequent p15 (8.7%) or Rb1 (17.4%) hypermethylation occurred, with p16 and Rb1 hypermethylation being mutually exclusive (P=.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, frequent hypermethylation of p15 (36.7%), p16 (56.7%), and Rb1 (43.3%) occurred, with p15 and Rb1 hypermethylation being mutually exclusive (P=.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concurrent methylation of p15 and p16 occurred in 26.7% of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 8.7% of patients with mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, there was more frequent p15 (P=.025) hypermethylation but comparable Rb1 (P=.07) and p16 (P=.07) hypermethylation in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a patient with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with sequential biopsies, Rb1 was unmethylated and expressed at diagnosis but became methylated and down-regulated at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, methylation analysis of these 4 genes in an additional 8 patients with grade I follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed that Rb, but not the other genes, was preferentially methylated in grade II (P=.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, most patients with mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had epigenetic aberrations targeting the INK4/Rb pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There is more frequent p16 hypermethylation in mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and p15 or Rb1 hypermethylation in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The role of Rb methylation in disease or histologic transformation in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> warrants further study </plain></SENT>
