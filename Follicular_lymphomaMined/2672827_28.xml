<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By using three bcl-2 DNA probes, 21 cases of non-Hodgkin's B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> arising from gastrointestinal mucosa and eight cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No rearrangement of the gene could be detected in the group of gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, although it was identified in 75% of the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that these two groups of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are not a family at genetic level and support the earlier suggestion that B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> arising from gastrointestinal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue are not of follicle center-cell lineage </plain></SENT>
