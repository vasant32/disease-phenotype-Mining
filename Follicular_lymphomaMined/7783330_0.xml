<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the size variation of neoplastic B cells (NBC) from lymph nodes of patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (BCL), we carried out two-dimensional analysis by flow cytometry (FCM) using the forward light scatter (FLS) and the fluorescence intensity (FI) of surface immunoglobulin light chain (sIgL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NBC were identified as having the homogeneous characteristics of both FLS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-restricted sIgL (kappa or lambda) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The FLS variation of NBC was then analyzed using CD3+ T-cells as a scale control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results closely coincided with the cell types determined by the pathologic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondly, we used FCM to investigate how strongly NBC express VLA-4 alpha and LFA-1 alpha, which seemed to play important roles in neoplastic follicle formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression intensities of these molecules were classified into three grades (-, + &amp; ++) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results were presented in the order of VLA-4 alpha and LFA-1 alpha; follicular 8/15 (++/++), 6/15 (++/+), 1/15 (+/++), partially follicular 3/5 (+/++), 2/5 (+/+), diffuse 2/16 (++/-), 6/16 (+/++), 8/16 (+/+), B-CLL 8/8 (-/+ or -) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are phenotypically distinguishable from diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
