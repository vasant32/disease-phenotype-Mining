<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Translocations of the bcl-2 protooncogene to the IgH locus at ontogenetically later IgH gene rearrangements are thought to represent exceptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we analysed the junctional nucleotide sequence of 18 bcl-2/IgH fusion genes identifiable by polymerase chain reaction performed on DNA extracted from diagnostic lymph node tissue of 14 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clones studied, segments of variable length were found interposed between bcl-2 and J(H) gene sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nucleotide sequence data analysis and comparisons performed with the corresponding germline sequences using the GenBank/EMBL database revealed the presence of D segments in most of the bcl-2/IgH fusion genes under study (13/18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By the same kind of computer-aided analysis, previously unrecognized D segments were identified in many published junctional sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that bcl-2/IgH fusion events are very prevalent in rather more differentiated stages in B-cell ontogeny than previously recognized </plain></SENT>
