<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied whether DAP-kinase hypermethylation plays a role as a prognostic marker in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that DAP-kinase was frequently hypermethylated in bone marrow (BM) samples of 52 FL patients at diagnosis (71%) and identified patients with worse progression-free survival (p=0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular, patients with histologically proven BM infiltration and DAP-kinase hypermethylation had a poorer outcome (p=0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a total of 170 BM samples obtained at diagnosis or during follow-up, DAP-kinase hypermethylation and the bcl2/IgH rearrangement gave concordant results in 67% of samples (48% both positive, 19% both negative) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both mrakers were independent predictors of the disease status (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
