<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the molecular genetics of the breakpoints involved in the t(8;14) and t(14;18) translocations of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> pre-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> from a patient with a history of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this patient's leukemic cells, the breakpoint of the t(14;18) translocation occurred in the major breakpoint-cluster region of the BCL2 gene and became linked to the JH4 joining-region gene segment of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus on the 14q+ chromosome as previously observed in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An N region and heptamer and nonamer signal sequences indicated that this translocation occurred as a mistake in VH-DH-JH joining (where VH and DH are the variable and diversity segments) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the t(8;14) translocation, the breakpoint was located immediately 5' of the first exon of the MYC protooncogene, which was juxtaposed with the C gamma 2 constant gene segment of the second 14q+ chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The finding of repeated sequences typical of switch regions suggested that this translocation occurred during heavy-chain isotype switching, resulting in progression to pre-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> with both the t(8;14) and the t(14;18) translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-positive phenotype of the patient's leukemic cells further suggests that the pre-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was derived from a pre-B cell carrying a t(14;18) translocation in the original follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The polymerase chain reaction method was then used to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells in the bone marrow of the patient </plain></SENT>
