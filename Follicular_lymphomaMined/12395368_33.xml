<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemical analysis of lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> has led to refined classification schemes based on the profile of antigen expression and correlation with morphological, cytogenetic, molecular, and clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tissue microarrays (<z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMAs</z:chebi>) are a powerful tool to rapidly characterize the phenotypic profile of a large number of samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show that this technique can be readily applied to the study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> by examining the expression profile of a series of 193 B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHLs) and 29 Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HLs</z:e>) using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The NHL cases were studied for the expression of commonly used markers-including CD3, CD5, CD10, CD20, CD23, CD30, CD43, Bcl-2, and cyclin D1 by immunohistochemical staining of <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMAs</z:chebi>-and these results were compared with whole sections (WS) of the same cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found a high degree of correlation between the results achieved with <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMAs</z:chebi> or WS (86% to 100% of cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>P53 and MIB-1 staining were studied, and the results were similar to that reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> cases were stained for CD20, CD30, CD15 (LeuM1), and latent membrane protein 1 expression, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> was performed using probes for EBER-1 and-2 transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> cases on <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> sections matched exactly with those of WS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We correlated cytogenetic results with immunohistochemical stains and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in cases of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> [t(11;14)(q13;q32)] and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> [t(14;18)(q32;q24)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This extensive expression profile of B-cell NHLs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> tissues discloses the ability of <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMAs</z:chebi> to rapidly screen a large series of cases and represents the first report of method validation for this technique in the study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
