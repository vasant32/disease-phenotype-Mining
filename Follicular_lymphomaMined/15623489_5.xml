<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The t(14;18) translocation is a common finding in nodal follicular B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and results in the overexpression of the antiapoptotic bcl2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This chromosome rearrangement can be detected by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with most breakpoints in the bcl2 gene occurring within either the major breakpoint region (mbr) or the minor cluster region (mcr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, recent investigations have revealed several breakpoints between these two regions, which cluster 19 kb 3' of mbr in the "intermediate cluster region" (icr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS/METHODS: To analyse a series of 57 B cell follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> known to carry the t(14;18) by PCR with primers directed against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cluster regions to determine the efficacy of screening the icr site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty six samples had an mbr rearrangement, four an mcr rearrangement, and three an icr rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that screening for icr is at least as efficacious as screening for mcr rearrangements </plain></SENT>
