<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using data of 455 advanced stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> patients treated within 3 clinical trials, we examined the prognostic relevance of IPI and FLIPI and derived a new prognostic index (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> international prognostic index, MIPI) of overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Statistical methods included Kaplan-Meier estimates and the log-rank test for evaluating IPI and FLIPI and multiple Cox regression for developing the MIPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IPI and FLIPI showed poor separation of survival curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to the MIPI, patients were classified into low risk (44% of patients, median OS not reached), intermediate risk (35%, 51 months), and high risk groups (21%, 29 months), based on the 4 independent prognostic factors: age, performance status, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH), and leukocyte count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation (Ki-67) was exploratively analyzed as an important biologic marker and showed strong additional prognostic relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The MIPI is the first prognostic index particularly suited for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> patients and may serve as an important tool to facilitate risk-adapted treatment decisions in patients with advanced stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
