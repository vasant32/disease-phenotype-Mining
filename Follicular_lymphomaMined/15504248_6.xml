<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CD10 is one of the hallmarks of germinal center B-cells where follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) originate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has not been clearly established, however, whether CD10(+) diffuse B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) are genetically similar to FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined 19 CD10(+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and 40 FL by means of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and tissue-fluorescence in situ hybridization (T-FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal imbalance was more frequently detected in CD10(+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> (19/19) than in FLs (24/40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were found in eight frequently imbalanced regions, namely those with gains of chromosomes 7q and 12 and those with losses of chromosomes 1p, 4p, 6q, 15q, 16p and 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Amplification of the 3q region where BCL6 is located is reported to occur frequently in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, but it was only found in one of the 19 CD10(+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> cases we examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The involvement of t(14;18) in CD10(+)+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (31%) and in FL (73%) was significantly different (P = 0.0064) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CGH pattern of CD10(+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> with t(14;18) was also different from that of FL with t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results indicate that CD10(+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> constitutes a unique subtype entity with genetic characteristics significantly different from those of FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
