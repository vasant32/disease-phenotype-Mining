<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ninety patients with Stage I or II, including extranodal (E), presentations of non-Hodkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were investigated by laparotomy, either for the definitive staging of patients with peripheral presentations or for diagnosis of abdominal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight patients had staging laparotomies after extensive work-up, which included lymphangiography and bone marrow biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The remaining 22 patients had laparotomies for diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011458'>abdominal symptoms</z:hpo> or for management of unrelated surgical problems, with lyphoma being found incidentally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of positive abdominal findings in the 68 patients who had staging laparotomies depended on histologic subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, abdominal disease was found in 17 of 28 (61%) and in diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, in 9 of 40 (22.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For patients with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> upstaged by laparotomy, the positive findings tended to cluster around an axis consisting of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">celiac</z:e>, porta-hepatic, para-aortic, and root of the mesentery lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, 64% of these patients had splenic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> upstaged by laparotomy, the distribution of positive findings was similar to that of the nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> group; however, only 1 patient had splenic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By contrast, in approximately half of the diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients who had laparotomies for diagnosis, the gastrointestinal tract was found to be involved in addition to the previously cited lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
