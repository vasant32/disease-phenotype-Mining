<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 390 patients with grade 1 or 2 FL were prospectively included in the multicentric <z:chebi fb="98" ids="24433">Groupe</z:chebi> d'Etude des Lymphomes Folliculaires trial and their BMB reviewed in order (i) to quantify the ratio of lymphomatous foci (LFo) area to that of BMB size (LFo/BMB), (ii) to determine the BMB patterns for a practical grading of marrow infiltration, (iii) to assess the intra- and inter-observer reproducibility of this grading and (iv) to analyse this grading on event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS), using univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 267 patients (68%) had BMB involvement, with inter- and intra-observer reproducibility for classifying the patterns of involvement of 91 and 96%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Uni- and multivariate analyses demonstrated the adverse influence of (i) a ratio of LFo/BMB &gt; or = 0.1, i.e. three or four nodules/medullary space or &gt; or = 1 nodule + foci of diffuse involvement on EFS (P = 0.03) and (ii) two different histological patterns in the same BMB on EFS (P = 0.004) and OS (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This latter finding was only significant in patients with a high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> burden and remained significant in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that BMB histology can predict survival of FL patients with a high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> burden, and may help in defining their treatment </plain></SENT>
