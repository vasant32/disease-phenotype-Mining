<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, immunohistochemical studies are usually applied to paraffin-embedded tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A modified direct immunoperoxidase procedure using fresh-frozen cryostat tissue sections, short incubation with peroxidase-labeled antikappa and antilambda antisera, and chromogens chemically unrelated to benzidine was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> previously characterized by direct immunofluorescence showed monoclonal surface membrane-associated light chains outlining each neoplastic cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follicular (nodular) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were characterized by monoclonal light chains in neoplastic nodules with compressed negative or polyclonal rims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diffuse non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> demonstrated diffuse individual cellular monoclonal staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymph nodes showed polyclonal immunostaining of follicular centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The immunostained slides resulting from this procedure are permanent preparations amenable to counterstaining </plain></SENT>
