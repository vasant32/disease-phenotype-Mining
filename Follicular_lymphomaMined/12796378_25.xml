<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify these uncertainties, interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to determine the incidence of the t(14;18) in nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, and this was correlated with BCL2 expression, germinal center (GC) immunophenotype, and patient outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FISH was performed on paraffin-extracted nuclei from 137 de novo nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of 137 de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> were t(14;18) positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18) was most commonly associated with the subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> that expressed a GC phenotype, defined as CD10+, BCL6+ (GC-type <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>): positive in 14 of 47 (30%) cases, compared with 4 of 89 (5%) in the non-GC group (Pearson's chi(2) = 28.4; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases with a translocation expressed BCL2 protein, however, 40 expressed BCL2 protein without a t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GC-type <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> patients with a t(14;18) had a significantly worse survival compared with GC-type <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> patients without the translocation (2-year survivals were 29 and 63%, respectively; P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the cases without the translocation, BCL2 protein expression did not affect survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the non-GC group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e>, BCL2 protein expression reduced the 2-year overall survival from 64% in the BCL2-negative group to 38%, with a median survival of 15.0 months (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the t(14;18) is common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e>, particularly in GC-type <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e>, where the presence of the translocation has a poor prognostic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BCL2 protein expression defines a group of non-GC <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> patients with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
