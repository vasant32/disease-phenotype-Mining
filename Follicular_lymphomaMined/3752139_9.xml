<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three classifications and the Working Formulation for non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> have been studied in 482 patients with a median follow-up of 11.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each classification was evaluated independently, and their similar and discrepant aspects were analyzed by comparing subgroups in the different schemes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical staging was essential in the evaluation of some categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are several differences between the classifications that are not readily reconcilable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Rappaport classification's principal groups are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Separation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> into small and large cleaved cell types (Lukes-Collins) is significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The addition of a follicular mixed cell type (Rappaport, Working Formulation) detracts from this significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Centrocytic and lymphoplasmacytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (Kiel) are well-defined categories and important in understanding some deficiencies in the other classifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The small cleaved cell type, diffuse (Lukes-Collins, Working Formulation) is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of mixed cell types are poorly defined subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Excluding lymphoblastic types, the presence of plasmacytic differentiation is important in identifying the high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with the poorest prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that adjustments should be made in the classifications and in the Working Formulation </plain></SENT>
