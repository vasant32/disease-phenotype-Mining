<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Tenascin is an extracellular matrix protein which accumulates in the stroma of various malignant and some benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has been verified in several immunohistochemical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The distribution of tenascin immunoreactivity in lymphatic tissues and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo>, however, has not been thoroughly studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this investigation we analyzed tenascin immunoreactivity in several benign and malignant lymphatic lesions, including both Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In benign lymph nodes, faint reticular immunoreactivity could be observed in the lymphatic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In benign reactive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasias</z:mpath>, a stronger reticular pattern of tenascin immunoreactivity was observed in the interfollicular and medullary areas, while the lymphoid follicles contained only a few positive fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A similar immunoreactivity was observed in malignant follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, a diffuse meshwork of positively stained fibers was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was also the case for the three cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> of the lymphocyte-predominance nodular subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the intensity of the immunoreactivity between benign and malignant disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> of the nodular <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> and lymphocyte-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> subtypes, a much more pronounced immunoreactivity could be observed in the fibrous septa and the cords </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells are possibly capable of synthesizing growth factors which stimulate fibroblasts to synthesize tenascin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that tenascin does not accumulate in the stroma of malignant lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> with the exclusion of some subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The distribution of tenascin immunoreactivity in lymphatic tissue is similar to that of the reticular fibers suggesting that the molecules are associated with these structures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
