<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 164 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (grade 1/2), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytoma</z:e>) was randomised to treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> 2 mg (day 1) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> 100 mg/m2 (days 1-5) + bendamustine 60 mg/m2 (days 1-5) or + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 400 mg/m2 (days 1-5) for a total of eight 21-day cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rate of complete remission was 22% with BOP and 20% with COP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The projected 5-year survival rate was 61% with BOP and 46% with COP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BOP-associated 5-year survival advantage almost reached significance in the subgroup of patients who responded to therapy (74% vs. 56%; P = 0.05), and did reach significance in responders who did not receive interferon maintenance therapy (70% vs. 47%; P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was acceptable in both treatment groups, although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leucopenia</z:e> were more severe with COP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bendamustine can efficaciously and safely replace <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, as used in standard COP therapy, for the treatment of patients with indolent NHL and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Long-term survival data suggest a clinically significant benefit for patients treated with BOP </plain></SENT>
