<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: To investigate the potential alterations of these genes in lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, we examined the presence of gene mutations in exons 3, 4, and 9 in 69 cases with mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>), 16 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), 12 with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) and 17 with large B-cell-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), as well as in 4 lymphoid cell lines carrying the t(11;14) translocation, and 91 healthy blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three CLL and three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> cases had 8p deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two nucleotide changes in or near the intron 3 splice consensus sequence and a silent change were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These rare changes were also present in the germ-line of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The DR4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> domain A1322G polymorphism was significantly more frequent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> [odds ratio (OR) = 5.9; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.92-18.1] and CLL (OR = 4.5; CI, 1.18-17) patients than in a sex and age-adjusted healthy population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the DR4 exon 4 C626G polymorphism was associated with a significant overall decreased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> (OR = 0.3; CI, 0.12-0.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No mutations or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-associated polymorphic changes were found in DR5 domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that mutations of DR4 and DR5 are uncommon in lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> but DR4 polymorphic alleles may contribute to the pathogenesis of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
