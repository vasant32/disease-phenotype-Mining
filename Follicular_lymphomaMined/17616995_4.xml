<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONTEXT: Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) grading is based on the average number of large transformed cells in 10 neoplastic follicles at x40 high-power field (x10-40 high-power field) examination (grade 1, 0-5 centroblasts per high-power field; grade 2, 6-15 centroblasts per high-power field; grade 3, &gt;15 centroblasts per high-power field) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Since there may be significant interobserver variability, we analyzed the usefulness of immunohistochemical stains in grading FLs more reliably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Forty-three FLs initially graded by World Health Organization criteria (grade 1, 12; grade 2, 18; grade 3, 13) were reviewed and stained with CD3, CD20, Ki-67, CD30, CD68, PAX-5, and BCL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Retrospective review was performed for the average number of large cells, of large lymphoid cells, of large cells staining with CD3, CD20, BCL-6 (40 cases), and PAX-5, and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cells staining with CD68, Ki-67, and CD30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By histologic review, 8 of 43 FLs had a significant grade change (4 cases upgraded and 4 cases downgraded) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD3 and CD30 stained only 0 to 3 large cells and 0 to 3 cells, respectively, in neoplastic follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD68+ cells represented the large nonlymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increasing FL grades demonstrated increases in Ki-67+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The original grade showed substantial agreement with CD20 and moderate agreement with PAX-5 and BCL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The original histologic grade agreed with immunohistochemical-based grade using 2 or more antibodies in 5 of 8 discordant cases (4 by CD20 or BCL-6 and PAX-5; 1 by CD20, PAX-5, and BCL-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Interobserver variability of histologic FL grading may be significant; we showed low-end "substantial agreement." Immunohistochemical stains (ie, CD20, PAX-5, and BCL-6) may more reliably determine the number of large transformed cells in neoplastic follicles; Ki-67 staining correlates with higher FL grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical stains may be evaluated in clinical trials of FL patients to determine prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
