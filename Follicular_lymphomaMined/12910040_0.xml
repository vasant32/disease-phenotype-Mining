<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the economic impact of using rituximab for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NLH) in comparison with conventional chemotherapy protocols (CHOP or CHVP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective study conducted between 1998 and 2000, the direct costs of treating inpatients with NHL rituximab (n=20) or CHOP/CHVP (n=17) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results, including costs of administering chemotherapy and adverse events, showed that the average cost per patient was comparable for the two strategies (9700 euro for rituximab, versus 8487 euro for conventional chemotherapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the rituximab group, the cost was mostly due to drug purchases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the conventional chemotherapy group, outlays were related to drug-induced toxicity and longer hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results were similar to others described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies are nevertheless needed for confirmation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For first-line treatement, the difference in the cost-effectiveness-ratio between rituximab and conventional drugs might be smaller, but sound data are not yet available </plain></SENT>
