<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is involved in survival and differentiation of reserve/stem cells in epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To obtain new insights into the role of p63 in malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (MLs), immunohistochemical staining for p63 and p53 was performed in 126 cases of MLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>p63 was expressed in 38 cases of MLs (30.2%) including 32/61 cases (52.5%) of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), 1/8 cases (12.5%) of precursor T-lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (T-LBL), 4/14 cases (28.6%) of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 1/6 cases (16.7%) of T/NK cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among p63 positive cases, p63 was strongly expressed in 15/32 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and 1/1 case of T-LBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>p63 was not expressed in mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, plasma cell <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myelomas</z:mp> and Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>p63 was coexpressed with p53 in 18/38 p63 positive cases in which only 4 cases were strongly coexpressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> p63+/p53+ cases were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>p63 overexpression (above 30%) cases showed significant poor survival (p=0.0228) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, there was no statistically significant correlation between p63 expression and IPI score on Multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We could speculate that p63 could act indirectly as an oncogene by inhibiting p53 functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Stage of differentiation of neoplastic lymphocytes appears to have a correlation with p63 expression in MLs </plain></SENT>
