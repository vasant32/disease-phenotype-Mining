<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells may recapitulate the behavior of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> germinal center (GC) B cells, some of which remain in follicles and others which have the capacity to migrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> activated B cells and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells bind to GCs in vitro and this interaction is mediated by VLA-4 on the lymphoid cell and VCAM-1 on follicular dendritic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since the disseminated nature of follicular NHLs may be related to the ability of PB and BM cells to recirculate through lymphoid tissues, we examined the adhesive characteristics of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells isolated from these site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells from 10 of 14 cases of follicular NHL involving PB or BM bound to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neoplastic GCs could similarly support the binding of PB or BM derived follicular NHL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This interaction was inhibited by monoclonal antibodies directed against VLA-4 and VCAM-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies may provide insight into the clinical behavior of these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More importantly the homing and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells is likely to be relevant to the use of PB and BM as a source of hematopoietic stem cells following high dose ablative therapy </plain></SENT>
