<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: forty patients with relapsed or refractory NHL were treated with either 3 or 10 mgâ€‰kg(-1) mapatumumab every 21 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the absence of disease progression or prohibitive toxicity, patients received a maximum of six doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: mapatumumab was well tolerated, with no patients experiencing drug-related hepatic or other dose-limiting toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) experienced clinical responses, including two with a complete response and one with a partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry staining of the TRAIL-R1 suggested that strong staining in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> specimens did not appear to be a requirement for mapatumumab activity in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: mapatumumab is safe and has promising clinical activity in patients with FL </plain></SENT>
