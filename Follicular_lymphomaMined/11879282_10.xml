<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OVERVIEW: The history of clinical applications of monoclonal antibodies has been intertwined with that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first report of a complete remission in 1981 described a patient with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who was treated with a murine anti-idiotype antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Later that decade there appeared additional encouraging reports of radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, immunotoxins, and other antibodies with antitumor effects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal antibodies as a treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> became reality in late 1997 when the US Food and Drug Administration approved the anti-CD20 chimeric monoclonal antibody rituximab for the treatment of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since that time an anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody (dacliximab) and an anti-CD25 immunotoxin fusion product (denileukin diftitox) have become clinically available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several radio- labeled antibodies, including the murine anti-CD20 products (131)I-tositumomab and (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan, are in advanced stages of clinical testing as are other unlabeled monoclonal antibodies with antilymphoma activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other antilymphoma immunotoxins that react with CD25, CD19, and CD22 also have shown promise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The therapeutic arsenal against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has been significantly changed by the addition of these antibody products that are active as single agents, and are synergistic, additive, or both with other antilymphoma treatments </plain></SENT>
