<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The most common translocation in non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) is a t(14;18)(q32;q21) recombining the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene (IGH) on chromosome 14 with the B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 2 (BCL2) gene on chromosome 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although NHLs carrying a t(14;18) typically begin as low-grade, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, they have a tendency towards transformation to more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e>, something that is accompanied, presumably caused, by the acquisition of secondary chromosomal changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One such common change is add(1)(p36), in which material of unknown origin is added to the tip of the short arm of chromosome 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH), a new FISH-based screening technique, to better characterize the rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whenever doubt persisted after M-FISH, hybridization with chromosome-specific probes was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 5 out of 14 informative cases, the extra material on 1p36 could be shown to have come from 17q, more specifically 17q11-21 --&gt; qter, whereas it came from 6p and 11q in two cases each and from 3p, 8p, 8q, 9q, and 12p in one case each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It appears, therefore, that der(1)t(1;17)(p36;q11-21) is a common secondary aberration in NHLs with t(14;18) as the primary abnormality, accounting for about one-third of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> add(1)(p36) chromosomes seen in this cytogenetic subset </plain></SENT>
