<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the testis involves the adjacent epididymis in approximately 60% of cases, but isolated epididymal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The file of a 34-year-old man was reviewed, and the biopsy material was studied by conventional <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, immunohistochemistry, and polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient presented with painless bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948371" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epididymal enlargement</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sequential bilateral epididymal biopsies revealed follicular lymphoproliferation with minimal involvement of one testis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin M antibodies to the Coxsackie B4 virus were increased, and the lesions were interpreted as an atypical reactive process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy was not pursued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four years after presentation, there was no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">local disease</z:e>, but a 3-cm lesion involving the skin of the forehead developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An excision biopsy revealed a large cell follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with features resembling the epididymal lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis by polymerase chain reaction revealed a t(14-18) translocation in skin and epididymal lesions confirming that the epididymal lesions were also lymphomatous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Staging revealed no other site of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To date, the patient, who was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> chemotherapy, remains well 28 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the testis and epididymis occur in older men, have an intermediate or high grade, diffuse histology, disseminate early, and follow an aggressive clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, this case is similar to the occasional reports of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221269" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudolymphoma</z:e> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that occur in younger men, are confined largely to the testis and epididymis, and have a good prognosis </plain></SENT>
