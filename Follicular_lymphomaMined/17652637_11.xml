<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are frequently associated with the t(14;18)(q32;q21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This translocation can be detected by karyotype, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to the breakpoints currently used for diagnosis located in the major breakpoint region (MBR) and the minor cluster region (mcr), recent studies have reported the existence of other breakpoints (3' BCL2, 5'mcr, and icr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five breakpoints in 236 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> by real-time PCR analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The distribution of breakpoint sites consisted of MBR in 118 cases (50%), mcr in 11 (5%), icr in 32 (13%), 3' BCL2 in 13 (6%), and 5' mcr in three cases (1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings illustrate significantly higher frequency of the icr breakpoint as compared with the more frequently studied mcr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correlation of breakpoints with histology showed that MBR breakpoints occur more frequently in grade 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (P = 0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A majority of the PCR-negative cases (75%) contained an IGH/BCL2 translocation with FISH methods, suggesting the presence of other BCL2 breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Correlation of breakpoints with survival did not reveal significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic laboratories should consider expanding their PCR methods to include other BCL2 breakpoints and correlating with FISH methods when appropriate </plain></SENT>
