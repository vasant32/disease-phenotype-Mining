<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tat-1 cells expressed lymphoid markers and developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> masses in immunodeficient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), Bax and p53 protein expression was revealed by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis confirmed P-gp expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetically, the Tat-1 cell line showed identical chromosomal alterations to that of the initial biopsy specimen, among which the most notable were the t(14;18) typical of FL and additional abnormalities involving chromosomes 1, 8 and 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multicolor FISH analysis delineated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> abnormalities, including a t(1p;8q), a der(8)(8q24::14q32::18q21) and a der(13)(13q32::8q24::14q32::18q21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further FISH investigations using a locus-specific probe cocktail containing c-myc, IgH and bcl-2 revealed fusion of these three loci on the derivatives 8 and 13, in addition to the derivative 14 IgH/bcl-2 fusion and an extra copy of c-myc on derivative chromosome 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate an additional example of the deregulation of bcl-2 and c-myc expression through recombination with a single IgH enhancer region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The unusual molecular features of the Tat-1 cell line render it a unique tool for studies focused on cytogenetic alterations, expression of multidrug resistance phenotype and expression of anti-apoptotic proteins in FL </plain></SENT>
