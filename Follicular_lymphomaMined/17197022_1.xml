<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the clinical characteristics and prognoses of patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> carrying 3q27 translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the 59 patients having 3q27 translocation, 10.9% had follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) and 23.1% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is of interest that the prognostic significance was not found between FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> with 3q27 translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival (PFS) rate was significantly higher in the FL patients with 3q27 translocation than in those with 18q21 translocation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the presence of 3q27 translocation is a significant prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
