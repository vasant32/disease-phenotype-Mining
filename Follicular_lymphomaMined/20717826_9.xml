<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 45 patients with untreated biopsy-proven follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who underwent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49134">18F-fluorodeoxyglucose</z:chebi> PET/CT (FDG PET/CT) and CT before and after chemoimmunotherapy induction treatment (rituximab combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PET/CT detected more nodal (+51%) and extranodal (+89%) lesions than CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PET/CT modified Ann Arbor staging in eight patients (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients (11%) initially considered as being early stage (I/II) were eventually treated as advanced stage (III/IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, an initial PET/CT prognostic score was significantly more accurate than the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index score in identifying patients with poor prognosis (i.e. patients with incomplete therapeutic response or early relapse) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of PET/CT for therapeutic response assessment was higher than that of CT (0.97 vs 0.64), especially due to its ability to identify inactive residual masses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, post-treatment PET/CT was able to predict patients' outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median progression-free survival was 48 months in the PET/CT-negative group as compared with 17.2 months for the group with residual uptake (p&lt;10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FDG PET/CT is useful for staging and assessing the prognosis and therapeutic response of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
