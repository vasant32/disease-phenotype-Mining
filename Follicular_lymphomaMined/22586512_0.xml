<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The high efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-containing regimens must, however, be balanced against the drug-related toxicity, which mainly affects the cardiovascular system and represents a major concern for clinicians, especially in the treatment of elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients' outcomes could be further improved, particularly for those at high risk of cardiotoxicity, by substituting liposomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> for conventional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This approach has already been tested and shown to be effective in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, especially in different subsets of patients with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The use of liposomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> in combination regimens for other conditions, such as follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, is also under investigation, and early results are promising </plain></SENT>
