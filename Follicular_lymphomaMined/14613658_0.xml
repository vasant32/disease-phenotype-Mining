<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this article was to explore the clinical manifestation, diagnosis, treatment and the patients' prognosis, and the main prognostic factors of PTL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The general information, clinical and pathologic classification, treatment method of 28 cases of PTL were reviewed retrospectively and analyzed in combination with the follow-up information of 24 cases of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In spite of 4 cases lost follow-up, 24 cases were followed-up for 1 to 14 years, the median time was 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical classification, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 3 cases in the group of the age less than 40 years were intraglandular type, 7 of 9 cases in the group of the age of 40-60 years were intraglandular type, 2 cases were extraglandular type, 7 and 9 cases in the group of the age more than 60 years were intraglandular and extraglandular type separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By the end of this follow-up period, among these 24 cases, 6 of the 9 patients in the clinical extraglandular type group and only 2 of 15 patients of the clinical intraglandular type group died of PTL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty cases whose neck masses were surgically removed completely lived 1 year or more, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 4 cases whose neck masses were resected incompletely lived less than 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pathologically, 11 cases of the B cell type, large lymphocytic group were still survival, the longest survival time was 68 months; but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 3 cases of the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> II died of PTL within 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The total survival rate of these 24 patients of 1 year,3 year,and 5 year were 61.54%, 43.31%, and 27.35%, separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The proper treatment strategy of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of thyroid gland is complete resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> followed by the post-operative radical radiotherapy and chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient's age, clinical classification, and radical resection may be dosely related to the patient's survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant relationship was found between the patient's survival and the pathologic classification of PTL </plain></SENT>
