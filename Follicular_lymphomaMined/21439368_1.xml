<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Persons with a history of specific ADs also have increased risk of NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As the coexistence of ADs and NHL could be caused by factors common to both diseases, here we examined whether some of the associated genetic signals are shared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overlapping risk loci for NHL subytpes and several ADs were explored using data from genome-wide association studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several common genomic regions and susceptibility loci were identified, suggesting a potential shared genetic background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two independent MHC regions showed the main overlap, with several alleles in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region exhibiting an opposite risk effect for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002056'>type I diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results support continued investigation to further elucidate the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
