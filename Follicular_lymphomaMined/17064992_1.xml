<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed biopsy samples from two indolent B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e>), that have transformed to diffuse-large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We correlated the presence or absence of DNA-mismatch repair enzymes by immunostaining as well as the p53 status to smoking history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (n = 30), 37% showed negative immunostaining of MLH1, 16% showed negative immunostaining of MSH2 and 63% had p53 mutations and/or protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighteen out of 20 transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and seven out of 10 CLL/SLL that have transformed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0349631" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Richter's syndrome</z:e>) were informative for smoking histories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that the relative risk of negative immunostaining for either MLH1 or MSH2 was 2.2 times higher in smokers than non-smokers (relative risk = 2.2041, 95% confidence interval: 0.89714, 5.41491) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No direct correlation was found between smoking and the mutations in the p53 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that cigarette smoking may play a role in the development of transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> through defective mismatch repair </plain></SENT>
