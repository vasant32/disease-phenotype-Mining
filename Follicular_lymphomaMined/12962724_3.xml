<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The molecular follow-up of 119 autografted Bcl-2/IgH positive patients was evaluated by nested PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In case of molecular recurrence, direct sequencing of involved rearrangements has been performed both at diagnosis and at the time of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two sequences then were compared in terms of breakpoints, N insertions, and JH usage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-five patients achieving molecular remission were identified in our patient sample (63%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, eight (10.6%) experienced molecular recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing of the Bcl-2/IgH translocation performed at diagnosis and recurrence showed identical rearrangements in six subjects and unrelated rearrangements in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As opposed to most true molecular relapses, unrelated rearrangements always occurred several years after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To date, the two subjects carrying unrelated rearrangements show no signs of active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This report is the first evidence that Bcl-2/IgH rearrangements unrelated to the original <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> clone can lead to false-positive results during the molecular follow-up of autografted FL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, we recommend confirmation by direct sequencing, at least for patients experiencing molecular relapse 2 or more years after the end of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This will be particularly important for patients enrolled in clinical trials that schedule additional treatment in case of molecular evidence of persistent disease activity </plain></SENT>
