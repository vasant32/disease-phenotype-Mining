<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cases were initially diagnosed by <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunophenotype and in 33 of them, on tissue histology, as follows: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (CLL), 20, 18 of them with atypical features; B cell prolymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (B-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53412">PLL</z:chebi>), two; mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>), 15; splenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with villous lymphocytes (SLVL), five; lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, six; follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, one and, four cases remained unclassifiable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FISH demonstrated BCL-1 rearrangement in the circulating cells from 15 cases classified as: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> (10), atypical CLL (three) and B-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53412">PLL</z:chebi> (two) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A definitive diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> was made on review of the spleen histology in one out of the three atypical CLL with BCL-1 rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 12 was detected in eight cases which included four atypical CLL, one typical CLL, two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> and one unspecified B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> by histology and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> had both <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 12 and BCL-1 rearrangement and the other was CD5+, CD23+ and had a CLL score of 3, suggesting the latter diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate that FISH analysis is useful to clarify the nature of the disease in patients presenting with a B cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> in which the diagnosis is difficult by conventional methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FISH established with certainty the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> by showing BCL-1 rearrangement in over two-thirds of cases in which this was suspected, including blastoid forms, and confirmed the diagnosis of most cases of atypical CLL </plain></SENT>
