<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A novel cell line, FLK-1, was established from bone marrow cells of a patient with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> by means of co-culture with follicular dendritic cell (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi>)-like cell line HK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotypic analysis showed that FLK-1 expressed CD10, CD19, CD20, CD38, IgG and HLA-DR, which is a typical feature of germinal center B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis of FLK-1 demonstrated t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation involving BCL2 and immunoglobulin heavy chain genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Especially noteworthy is that the growth of FLK-1 was found to be dependent on a <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> line, HK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When HK cells were removed from the culture, FLK-1 cells stopped growing and eventually died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An apoptotic mechanism appeared to be involved as indicated by the presence of chromosome condensation and DNA ladder formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The culture experiment using micropore membranes showed that soluble factor(s) of HK cells supported the growth, while direct cell-to-cell contact appeared to be necessary for longterm cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest the importance of the micro-environment for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells to grow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The FLK-1 cell line may thus prove to be useful for studying the growth mechanism of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and provide new insights into the pathogenesis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
