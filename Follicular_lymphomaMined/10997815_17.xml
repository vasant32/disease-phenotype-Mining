<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: 'Molecular response' is being investigated as a therapeutic goal in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High response rates in FL with the fludarabine combination 'FMD' have been associated with 'molecular remission' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A phase II study of FMD in FL was therefore conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-four patients, ten of whom were newly diagnosed received FMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-four percent of the previously treated patients had 'chemoresistant' disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment comprised: fludarabine 25 mg/m2 days 1-3, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> 10 mg/m2 day 1, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> 20 mg days 1-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood/bone marrow was collected for quantitation of t(14;18) by 'real-time' PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response rate was 37 of 54 (69%), complete responses being seen in 11 patients (20%), with no difference between newly diagnosed and the previously treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the response rate in 'chemosensitive' relapse was 84% compared to 44% in patients in whom the last prior regimen had failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Molecular responses were seen in 17 of 25 and PCR negativity in 8 of 25, although molecular and clinical responses did not always correlate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was moderate, 19 patients required admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, in 6 of 12 patients, subsequent G-CSF mobilised stem cell harvests failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FMD was well tolerated but with a lower than expected response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Molecular responses were seen in the majority of responding patients however, 'molecular remission' was rare </plain></SENT>
