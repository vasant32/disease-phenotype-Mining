<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: According to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> positivity in analyzed preparations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were divided into three categories: negative (-) with less than 1 per cent of positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells for the above-mentioned oncogenes; moderately positive (+) with 1 to 50 per cent of positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, and extremely positive (+ +) with over 50 per cent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-seven (73%) patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were bcl-2 negative, seven (19%) were bcl-2 positive (+), and only one (3%) patient was extremely positive for bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 was present in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> regardless of the intensity, whereas its presence was not recorded in other subtypes of indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 was moderately positive (+) in six of 11 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As for aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, bcl-2 was present in three patients, one (3%) of them diagnosed with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade III and moderately positive (+) bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other two patients were diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, with moderate (+) and extreme (+ +) bcl-2 positivity recorded in one patient each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>P53 was negative (-) in six (16%), positive (+) in 27 (73%) and extremely positive (+ +) in four (11%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Positive p53 was found in patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> regardless of the level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the expression of oncogenes could be determined in the archival material of lymph node biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results on oncogene expression were consistent with the expected incidence based on other characteristics of the study population </plain></SENT>
