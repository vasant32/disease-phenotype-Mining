<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More importantly, most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells derived from B cell lineage express a very low level of the adenovirus receptor hCAR; thus, warranting the design of adenoviral vectors with high affinity to abundant B cell surface molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To mimic this approach and to test the validity of adenoviral vectors in gene therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346957" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">disseminated malignancies</z:e>, we created an hCAR-expressing follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cell line was generated with the aid of a lentivirus vector carrying a novel fusion gene with EGFP replacing the cytoplasmic domain of hCAR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After verifying that this cell line was expressing the hybrid receptor in a correct manner and enrichment of the bright EGFP positive population, the cells were transduced with adenoviruses expressing the red fluorescent protein DsRed2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was shown that regular transduction with a low <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> dose (1 pfu/cell) increased the gene transfer rate by a factor of 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, experiments with adenovirus vector carrying the HSV-TK-GFP transgene demonstrated that the modified follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B cells became sensitive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> while the parental cells remained virtually resistant to this form of gene therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, we show here with this simple model system that adenoviral gene therapy of B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> is possible provided that correct receptors for adenovirus attachment are present on the surface of the target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, our results warrant further modifications of adenovirus capsid to obtain vectors with specific affinity to B cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
