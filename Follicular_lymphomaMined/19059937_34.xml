<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The clinical behavior of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is largely determined by properties of the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant tumor</z:e> microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The precise nature of the cell populations is still unclear and published data on their prognostic significance are highly conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This may be partly due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> composition and treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Pre-treatment biopsy samples of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated in an EORTC/BNLI trial comparing fludarabine to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CVP) chemotherapy could be retrieved for 61 patients in five European countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical investigations were performed evaluate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell characteristics, T-cell subsets, follicular dendritic cells and macrophages and associations with clinical outcome were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Some markers showed a homogeneous prognostic impact, while others had a different nd sometimes opposite effect in the treatment arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD69 expression on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells was a poor prognostic sign and an interfollicular infiltrate of FoxP3-positive T cells was a good prognostic sign irrespective of the treatment arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is suggestive that a dense infiltrate of FoxP3-positive T cells, dense and interfollicular infiltrate of CD68-positive macrophages and complete follicular dendritic meshworks were associated with a favorable time to progression in CVP-treated patients, while being poor prognostic sign in fludarabine-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that characteristic properties of the microenvironment in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> determines the responses to essentially different chemotherapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data may provide an explanation for the highly conflicting results on immunohistochemical markers and the prognostic role of the microenvironment in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> reported thus far and lay the basis for the development of predictive assays to tailor treatment in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
