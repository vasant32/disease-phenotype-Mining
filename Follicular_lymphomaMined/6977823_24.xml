<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fifty human B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> have been studied with regard to surface markers (surface immunoglobulins (sIg) and complement receptors (CR)), capping of sIg, and relative amounts of sIg by single-cell flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results show that these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> can be subdivided into distinct immunological subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whereas one histological subgroup (lymphocytic) consisted of only one immunological subtype, others were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> with regard to immunological subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was most striking in nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of germinal centre cell origin (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e>/centrocytic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our studies provide further evidence for the existence of a large number of subsets in the B-cell compartment of the immune system, sIgD was only found in association with sIgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative amounts of sIgD varied, especially in nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A discrepancy between capping of sIgM and sIgD was also found in some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> belonging to this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings together with other observations suggest that sIgD plays a role in B-cell maturation and differentiation events taking place in germinal centres and becomes lost during this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A close association was found between the presence of CR and capping of sIgM but not capping of sIgD or sIgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> expressing sIgG only, lacked CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that CR may become lost during maturation and differentiation processes also taking place in germinal centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lymphoplasmacytoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, which show morphological evidence of differentiation towards plasma cells, could be subdivided into three immunological subsets, indicating that plasma cell maturation may take place from different subsets of B cells </plain></SENT>
