<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) are two subtypes of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> which possess t(14;18) and t(11;14) translocations, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> is higher in the western countries as compared to India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the associated translocations are also found in healthy individuals in western population, which is 50-80% for t(14;18), whereas t(11;14) occurs at a very low frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there are no studies to explore these translocations in healthy Indian population, which could explain the lower incidence of FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We employed Southern hybridization following nested PCR to detect above translocations in healthy individuals from India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that this assay can detect one t(14;18) translocation event in up to 10(7) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells where as one t(11;14) in 10(8) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to our results, 87 out of 253 individuals carry t(14;18) indicating 34% prevalence in the population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of this translocation was also detectable at the transcript level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although, no gender-based difference was observed, an age-dependent increase in the prevalence of translocation was found in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, even after studying 210 people, we could not detect any t(11;14) translocation, indicating that it is uncommon in Indian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that lower incidence of FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> in India could be attributed to lower prevalence of these translocations in healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
