<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: In the Western world the second most common type of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) comprising 30-35% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to the data of the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry and our institute, this ratio is lower in Hungary and is about 15-20%, but the occurrence shows an increasing tendency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Our aim was to survey and revise FLs that had been diagnosed at the National Institute of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> between 1990-1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the diagnostic relevance of histology, immunohistochemistry and the detection of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) and bcl-2 gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We surveyed 53 cases that were previously diagnosed as follicular or centrocytic, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following histological re-examination, immunohistochemistry (CD20, CD3, bcl-2, CD10, bcl-6, CD5, p53, cyclin D1 and Ki-67) was performed on each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also studied the IgH and bcl-2 (major breakpoint region=MBR) gene rearrangement on paraffin embedded samples with conventional PCR methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The classification was made according to the new WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After the revision of the 53 cases we found 37 follicular, 11 diffuse large B-cell, 1 mantle cell and 1 marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 1 nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The grade of the FLs correlated with the expression of different antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CD10, bcl-2 expression and the proliferation index with Ki-67 showed good correlation with the grade of FLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We could detect bcl-2 gene rearrangement in 55% of the FLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Considering the diagnostic relevance of the different methods we can conclude that histology alone is not sufficient to make a correct diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ninety percent of our cases were solvable with the help of immunohistochemistry and in 10% of the cases the diagnosis was partly based on the molecular pathological results </plain></SENT>
