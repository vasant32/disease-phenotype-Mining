<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases display evidence of secondary chromosomal alterations at initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The influence of recurrent secondary changes on disease progression has not been fully determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to define the full spectrum of recurrent karyotypic events present at diagnosis in a large cohort of cases and to evaluate the sequence of cytogenetic evolution in relation to morphologic progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 165 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with t(14;18) were ascertained for which complete clinical information, histopathology, immunophenotype, and karyotype were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred sixty cases showed secondary alterations with an average of 7.9 additional changes per case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recurrent alterations seen at the 10% or greater level included +X, +1q21-q44, +7, +12q, +18q, del(1)(p36), del(6q), del(10)(q22-q24), the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0004025'>polyploidy</z:mp> and sidelines, and the presence of extra marker chromosomes and chromosomal additions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Changes that correlated with morphologic progression included del(1)(p36), del(6q), del(10)(q22-q24), +7, the total number of abnormalities, the number of markers and additions, and the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004025'>polyploidy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequent second event arising after the t(14;18) was duplication of the der(18)t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that the number and type of secondary chromosomal alterations in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is highly variable between cases, but that a relatively small number of changes are seen repeatedly in different combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A consistent pattern of cytogenetic evolution could not be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Potentially significant gene duplications or amplifications may be disguised within marker chromosomes and additions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additional cytogenetic investigation is required to decipher the karyotypic complexity associated with the progression of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
