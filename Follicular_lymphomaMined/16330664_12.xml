<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Although intravenous (IV) fludarabine phosphate is effective against indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B-NHL), IV administration for 3 to 5 consecutive days is inconvenient in an outpatient setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the efficacy and toxicity of oral fludarabine phosphate in patients with indolent B-NHL, we conducted a multicenter phase II study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with relapsed indolent B-NHL received fludarabine phosphate tablets orally once daily on days 1 through 5 every 28 days for three to six cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The efficacy was separately analyzed in a mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) cohort and indolent B-NHL except for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> (IL) cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was the overall response rate (ORR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-two patients, including 46 in the IL cohort (41 with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) and six in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> cohort, were registered, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-one patients (79%) had received rituximab as prior therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the IL cohort, the ORR and complete response rate were 65% (30 of 46 patients; 95% CI, 50% to 79%) and 30% (14 of 46 patients; 95% CI, 18% to 46%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One of six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> achieved a partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median times to treatment failure for the 46 patients in the IL cohort and for the six patients in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> cohort were 8.6 and 6.1 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hematologic toxicities, including grade 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (37%), were the most frequent toxicities, and nonhematologic toxicities were mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Oral fludarabine phosphate is highly effective in patients with relapsed indolent B-NHL who have mostly been pretreated with rituximab and is more convenient than the IV formulation </plain></SENT>
