<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in mammals are well-known to play important roles in innate immunity, newer roles for the TLRs have suggested that cells with aberrant TLR expression may have a survival advantage over <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes are one of a small number of cell types that express many of the TLRs, suggesting that abnormal TLR levels/signaling may potentially influence the progression of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, frozen samples of 51 lymph nodes from patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e>) were analyzed for the expression of TLR1 to 9 using quantitative real-time PCR, and compared to those in reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> (RL) samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TLR2 was over-expressed in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e> but not in FL when compared to RL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TLR1 and TLR4 expression was up-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e>, while TLR8 was highly expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although TLR5 showed lower expression in FL, expression of TLR3, TLR6, TLR7 and TLR9 did not vary significantly between different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Double immunostaining revealed an increase in the number of TLR2 and/or TLR8 expressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e>, TLR2 and TLR4 expression was localized to neoplastic T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TLR expression is highly variable among <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, despite this some significant differences exist that may prove useful in the development of novel therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
