<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the efficacy and safety of patient-specific immunotherapy with mitumprotimut-T idiotype keyhole limpet hemocyanin and granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) following rituximab in patients with follicular B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with previously untreated or relapsed/refractory CD20+ follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> received 4 weekly infusions of rituximab and those with a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease received mitumprotimut-T and GM-CSF injections subcutaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Courses were given monthly for 6 doses, every 2 months for 6 doses, and then every 3 months until disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography scans were obtained every 3 to 6 months and reviewed centrally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 103 patients treated with rituximab, 92 (54 relapsed/refractory and 38 previously untreated) received mitumprotimut-T/GM-CSF; median age was 53 years, 91% had stage III to IV disease, and 59% had failed earlier therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The premitumprotimut-T objective response rate was 47% (2 CRs, 41 PRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the mitumprotimut-T treatment phase, 16 patients converted to CR resulting in an overall objective response rate of 60% (18 CRs, 37 PRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median EFS was 15.2, 20.8, and 13.5 months for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, treatment-naive, and relapsed/refractory disease patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anti-Id cellular immune responses were detected in 13 of 18 (72%) patients and humoral immune responses in 17 of 83 (20%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were usually mild-to-moderate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most common adverse event was injection site reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mitumprotimut-T/GM-CSF-induced anti-Id cellular immune responses in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of late CRs and favorable EFS suggested a clinical benefit of active immunotherapy and led to a placebo-controlled phase 3 trial </plain></SENT>
