<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the translocation process the bcl-2 gene located on chromosome 18 (18q21) is translocated to the JH region of the immunoglobulin gene of chromosome 14 (14q32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most frequent type of bcl-2 translocations is the mbr type, whereas the immunoglobulin gene breaks mainly at the JH1-6 exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>About one of the 10(5) cells bearing the translocation can already be detected by using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight patients suffering from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were included in this study, which considered the usefulness of the PCR method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results are in good agreement with those obtained by conventional diagnostic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Translocation can be detected, however, in patients with non-malignant diseases such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjögren's syndrome</z:e> (about 5% of the patients) and in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023788" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Whipple disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, translocation was detected in lymphocytes of peripheral blood of a healthy donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are detected in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjögren's syndrome</z:e> with a relative high frequency, an early diagnosis of the translocation could improve the treatment of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is valid only in cases of bone marrow translocation-positivity </plain></SENT>
