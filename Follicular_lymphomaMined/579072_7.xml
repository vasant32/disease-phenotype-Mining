<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The transformations occurred 21 and 34 months after the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and were associated with rapid deterioration of the patients' conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The leukemic phase was characterized by plasmacytic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> appearing lymphoid cells in the peripheral blood and marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such transformation, though rare, is not unexpected in view of the currently postulated origin of nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in germinal center cells and of immunoglobulin-producing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in cells derived from germinal center cells </plain></SENT>
