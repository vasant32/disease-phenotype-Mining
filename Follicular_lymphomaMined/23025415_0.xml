<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 80% of them were B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with a predominance of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) in both nodal and extranodal sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results were compatible with those in a previous study that was conducted in the central part of Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This analysis was performed to describe the anatomic distribution of hematolymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> that were diagnosed by biopsy in our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical medical records of 122 patients with hematolymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> in the head and neck from January 2004 to December 2010 were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The anatomic site of origin according to the histopathology of each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence ratio of hematolymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> was 15.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The male:female ratio was 2.3:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ages ranged from 17 to 89 years (median, 66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 122 cases, 121 were lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (4 cases of Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 117 cases of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) and the remaining 1 was myeloid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common histopathology was <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (54.9%), followed by follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (8.2%), and peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (8.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most commonly, the oropharynx (36.1%) and the cervical lymph node (34.4%) were affected </plain></SENT>
