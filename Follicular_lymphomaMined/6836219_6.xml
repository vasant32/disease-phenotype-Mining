<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a retrospective survey of 334 cases of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), 250 cases could be classified according to both Rappaport's classification and the Kiel classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients initially in stage I had an excellent prognosis irrespective of histology, whereas patients in stages II, III and IV had a worse prognosis that did not significantly differ between stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rappaport's classification could separate stages II-IV into 2 different prognostic groups, one favourable and one unfavourable group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to the Kiel classification, 3 prognostic groups - favourable, intermediate and unfavourable - were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The survival rate for favourable Rappaport fell in between favourable-Kiel and intermediate-Kiel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both subgroups within favourable-Rappaport (nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and diffuse well differentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) could actually be subdivided by the Kiel classification into one group with a more truly favourable behaviour and one with an intermediate behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The extent of follicularity among nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and the presence of plasmacytoid differentiation among the small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were found to be of prognostic importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we found that the Kiel classification separated the more indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> better than Rappaport's classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No preference was found concerning the high grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
