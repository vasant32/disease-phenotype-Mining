<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The use of intensive therapy supported by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is being investigated as treatment for poor-prognosis follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A single-center experience is herein reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: From September 1990 to October 1997, 30 consecutive patients (pts) with advanced FL received transplants, 8 of bone marrow and 22 of peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirteen harvests were purged by an immunomagnetic method using anti-B antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients received salvage chemotherapy (CT) before ASCT with the objective of reaching this procedure in the best possible response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The disease status at ASCT was: 1(st) CR in 7 pts, &gt; or =2(nd) CR in 6 pts, PR in 10 pts, untreated relapse in 2 pts and chemoresistant disease in 5 pts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was only one transplant-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (one month after ASTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 19 (1-89) months, 27 pts are alive, 8 pts have relapsed/progressed at a median time of 11 (6-22) months after ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The estimated 2-year PFS and OS are 57% (95% CI, 34-81%) and 83% (95% CI, 64-100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When comparing the progression-free interval (PFI) before salvage CT and ASCT and the PFI after ASCT, of 17 evaluable pts, 10 had a PFI after ASCT longer than the previous interval, and 5 additional pts remain in CR/PR with a follow-up that has not yet reached the duration of pre-transplant response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By contrast, 2 pts had a short post-transplant response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: High-dose therapy followed by ASCT obtains a high rate of responses, frequently longer than any previous PFI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additional follow-up is necessary to determine whether there is any "plateau" in response duration and to define what proportion of pts may be cured with ASCT in this setting </plain></SENT>
