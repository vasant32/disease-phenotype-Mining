<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Limited data exist about the role of second-line chemotherapy response assessed by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) as a prognostic factor in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) who undergo autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this analysis was to investigate the main determinants of prognosis in patients with aggressive B-cell NHL who undergo ASCT, focusing on the impact of pretransplantation PET, secondary age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (sAA-IPI) score, histology, and previous response to first-line chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-five patients with diffuse, large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or grade 3 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who were treated at the author' institution with second-line chemotherapy (combined ifosfamide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47898">epirubicin</z:chebi> [IEV]) followed by ASCT between September 2002 and September 2006 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were evaluated by PET after 1 to 3 courses of IEV chemotherapy before ASCT, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients received a conditioning regimen of combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3423">carmustine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi>, and melphalan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prognostic impact of pretransplantation PET, sAA-IPI score, histology, and previous response to first-line chemotherapy was evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-two of 75 patients underwent ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a univariate analysis for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), a significant association was observed with pretransplantation PET (PFS, P&lt; .00001; OS, P&lt; .01) and previous first-line response (PFS, P= .02; OS, P= .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate framework, pretransplantation PET was identified as the only independent prognostic factor (PFS, P&lt; .001; OS, P= .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current data indicated that pretransplantation PET is the main prognostic predictor in patients with aggressive B-cell NHL who are scheduled for ASCT </plain></SENT>
