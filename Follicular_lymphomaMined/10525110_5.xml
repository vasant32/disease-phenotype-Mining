<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Antisense oligonucleotides (oligos) have the ability to selectively block disease-causing genes, thereby inhibiting production of disease-associated proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, their effectiveness has been limited by their low intracellular delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We had previously demonstrated that liposomes could increase the intracellular uptake of P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="42241">ethoxy</z:chebi> oligos, hydrophobic analogs of phosphodiesters, and that liposomal Bcl-2 P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="42241">ethoxy</z:chebi> antisense oligos (L-Bcl-2) could selectively inhibit Bcl-2 protein production, thereby inducing growth inhibition in Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To understand the in vivo behavior of L-Bcl-2, we conducted a series of studies to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and tissue distribution of i.v. injections of L-Bcl-2 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Daily administration of 20 mg of L-Bcl-2/kg of body weight in 5 consecutive days had no adverse effects on renal or hepatic functions, nor on hematological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histopathology also did not reveal any significant changes in the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the organs studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In rats, the area under the curve of L-Bcl-2 reflects a two-compartment model of distribution with a biphasic plasma clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The T(1/2alpha) and T(1/2beta) were approximately 8 min and 4.2 h, respectively, and the V(d) was 79 ml, indicating a broad body distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The highest concentrations of L-Bcl-2 were found in spleen &gt; liver &gt; kidneys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These studies showed that in the schedules studied no significant toxicity associated with L-Bcl-2 was observed over 6 weeks, and that L-Bcl-2 could be widely distributed in the body </plain></SENT>
