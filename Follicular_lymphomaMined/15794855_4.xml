<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Differential diagnosis from other B-cell disorders (BCDs) is usually easy based on clinical, morphologic, histopathologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BCDs potentially produce monoclonal IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we reviewed the medical files of 130 patients with IgM-secreting BCDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-four patients were diagnosed with WM, 5 with IgM-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278494" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MGUS">monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MGUS</z:e>), and 41 with other BCDs (9 with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, 5 with small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 14 with marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 5 with mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 2 with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 2 with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100778'>cryoglobulinemia</z:hpo>, and 2 with low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> not otherwise specified) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median IgM levels were 3215 mg/dL in WM, 840 mg/dL in IgM-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MGUS</z:e>, and 285 mg/dL in other BCDs (5 had IgM levels &gt; 1500 mg/dL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 10% of non-WM BCDs, monoclonal IgM was found only when more sensitive immunofixation methods were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-four percent of patients with BCDs (splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) had diagnoses that corresponded to that of WM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Careful diagnosis requires the concomitant evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters of BCDs together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is the most frequently overlapping entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Special attention should be given to mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in its atypical forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Research in this field should continue to further clarify the disease entities that overlap with WM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>New technology such as gene-expression profile techniques may contribute to this purpose </plain></SENT>
