<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We explored the expression of LCK and BAFF-R (B-cell activating factor receptor) both of which are known to play a role in signaling and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, in routine tissue biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was hypothesized that their expression patterns might yield information on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> as it occurs in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and reactive lymphoid cells, and also be of value for the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Both molecules were studied in paraffin-embedded tissue sections and cell lines by immunoperoxidase staining, and were also studied by western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human tonsillar B-cell subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry for LCK expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LCK was detected for the first time in germinal centers and, at lower levels, in mantle zone B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of LCK in B cells was confirmed by western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cross-linking surface IgM reduced LCK expression whereas cross-linking surface CD40 appeared to have the opposite effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BAFF-R was present on mantle zone B cells but absent or weakly expressed in germinal center cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of germinal center origin (e.g. follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) and also many mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) and most T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> expressed LCK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, BAFF-R was expressed in a variety of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, but often absent in grade 3 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both LCK-positive and BAFF-R-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> tended to be of germinal-center phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The reciprocal expression pattern of LCK and BAFF-R in germinal center and mantle zone B cells may reflect their opposing roles in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Their detection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissue biopsies may therefore be of clinical relevance in predicting response to treatment </plain></SENT>
