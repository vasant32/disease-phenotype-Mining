<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most often studied to date has been the macroscopic dosimetry related to organ and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> distribution of the radiolabeled antibody, but the question of microscopic dose <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> is also important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address the latter issue, we have taken an integrated approach to the pharmacology, taking into account whole-body distribution, transcapillary transport, percolation through the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> interstitial space, antigen-antibody interaction, and antibody metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first step is to simulate the spatial antibody concentration profile in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> as a function of time after i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(e.g., bolus) injection, using reasonable values for the parameters involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second step is to calculate, also as a function of time, the absorbed radiation dose distribution resulting from each concentration profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Parameter values for IgG pharmacology and a radiation point source function for 131I are used to explore the effect of antibody distribution profiles on absorbed dose in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The geometry simulated corresponds to a spherical nodule of densely packed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Absorbed doses are calculated for radiation from a single nodule (e.g., a micrometastasis or prevascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>) and for a cubic lattice of such nodules (e.g., corresponding to nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As noted in our previous studies, there is a "binding site barrier." Binding to antigen retards antibody percolation into the nodules; high antibody affinity tends to decrease percolation and give a higher absorbed dose near the surface of each nodule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneous</z:hpo> antibody distribution results in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> absorbed dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is more apparent in the case of radiation from a single nodule than it is for radiation from within an array of nodules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Dehalogenation results in a lower absorbed dose over time, and the effect is more apparent at later times after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="17300">PERC</z:chebi>-RAD, the computer program package developed for these analyses, provides a convenient and flexible way to assess the impact of macroscopic and microscopic parameters on the distribution of radioimmunoconjugates and on the consequent profile of absorbed radiation dose in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This mathematical model and the general principles developed here can be applied as well to other radiolabeled biological ligands </plain></SENT>
