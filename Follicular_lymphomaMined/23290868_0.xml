<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While FIV has previously been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, the rapidity and high attack rate seen here is highly unusual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PCR for antigen receptor rearrangements (PARR) detected clonally rearranged T cells in two animals diagnosed with B cell follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> by classical means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cats were negative for feline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> virus; gamma-herpesvirus DNA was not amplified using degenerate primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FIV proviral load in neoplastic tissue was two orders of magnitude lower than in the periphery, lower in neoplastic vs non-neoplastic lymph node, and clonal integration was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was secondary to FIV <z:hpo ids='HP_0002958'>immune dysregulation</z:hpo>, and show that PARR can augment our capacity to phenotype these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and distinguish <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age of exposure and relative virulence of the inoculum likely contributed to this unusual presentation of FIV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
