<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present an approach to deriving very simple classification rules from microarray data by first selecting very small gene subsets that can ensure highly accurate classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Finding such minimum gene subsets can greatly reduce the computational load and "noise" arising from irrelevant genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The derived simple classification rules allow for accurate diagnosis without the need for any classifiers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This work can simplify gene expression tests by including only a very small number of genes rather than thousands or tens of thousands of genes, which can significantly bring down the cost for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These studies also call for further investigations into possible biological relationship between these small number of genes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For example, we report the following simple, and yet 100% accurate, diagnostic rules involving only 2 genes to separate the 3 types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients: the patient has diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), if and only if the expression level of gene GENE1622X is greater than -0.75; the patient has <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (CLL), if and only if the expression level of gene GENE540X is less than -1; and the patient has follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) otherwise, i.e., if and only if the expression level of gene GENE1622X is less than -0.75 and the expression level of gene GENE540X is greater than -1 </plain></SENT>
