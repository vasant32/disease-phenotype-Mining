<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In human follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> the t(14; 18) chromosome translocation activates the antiapoptotic oncogene Bcl2 by linking it to the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transgenic mice expressing Bcl2 controlled by an Igh enhancer (E mu) do not develop follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, although they do have an increased incidence of other B-lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have now analyzed <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> in mice bearing a Bcl2 transgene controlled by Vav gene regulatory sequences (VavP), which confer expression in multiple hematopoietic lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unlike E mu-Bcl2 mice, many VavP-Bcl2 mice older than 10 months developed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Young VavP-Bcl2 mice had an overabundance of enlarged germinal centers and greatly elevated numbers of cycling B cells that had undergone IgH class switching and V-gene hypermutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The peripheral T-cell compartment was larger in the VavP-Bcl2 mice than in E mu-Bcl2 strains and, notably, CD4 T cells were 5-fold increased over <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The germinal center <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> required CD4 T cells, because it could be abolished by anti-CD4 antibody in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VavP-Bcl2 mice also had a propensity to develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> of the autoimmune type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the increased survival capacity of B and T cells fosters prolonged germinal center reactions, and that autoreactivity and hypermutation conspire to generate follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
