<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that targets CD20 on B cells, is now central to the treatment of a variety of malignant and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite this success, a substantial proportion of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are unresponsive or develop resistance, hence more potent anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are continuously being sought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that type II (tositumomab-like) anti-CD20 mAbs are 5 times more potent than type I (rituximab-like) reagents in depleting human CD20 Tg B cells, despite both operating exclusively via activatory Fcgamma receptor-expressing macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Much of this disparity in performance is attributable to type I mAb-mediated internalization of CD20 by B cells, leading to <z:mp ids='MP_0003799'>reduced macrophage recruitment</z:mp> and the degradation of CD20/mAb complexes, shortening mAb half-life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, human B cells from healthy donors and most cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphatic leukemia</z:hpo> and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, showed rapid CD20 internalization that paralleled that seen in the Tg mouse B cells, whereas most follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were far more resistant to CD20 loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We postulate that differences in CD20 modulation may play a central role in determining the relative efficacy of rituximab in treating these diseases and strengthen the case for focusing on type II anti-CD20 mAb in the clinic </plain></SENT>
