<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine its expression in malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ML), 103 non-Hodgkin's MLs and 18 Hodgkin's (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) MLs, together with non-tumorous lymphoid tissues were immunohistochemically analyzed, using two antibodies specific for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In non-tumorous tonsils and lymph nodes, B-lymphocytes, especially in the mantle zones, and histiocytes stained heavily, while T-lymphocytes failed to stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 55 B-MLs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (9/9) and 18/46 of the diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were found to express <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> b558 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 48 T-MLs, 46 were unstained by antibodies against the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> b558-positive cases were CD 30-positive anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of 18 HD patients had CD 30-positive Reed-Sternberg cells which also stained with antibody alpha LC (an anticytochrome b558 antibody) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> b558, represents a new lymphocyte differentiation antigen </plain></SENT>
