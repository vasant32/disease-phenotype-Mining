<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and non-Hodgkin's B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> occasionally occur in the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The identification of a common precursor of the two types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> would show definitively that Reed-Sternberg cells originate from B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> from two patients, one with a composite <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the same lymph node) and the other with a T-cell-rich B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that was followed by classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Single Reed-Sternberg cells and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells from frozen sections were micromanipulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rearranged immunoglobulin variable-region genes (V genes) of the heavy and light chains were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA and sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both patients, the Reed-Sternberg cells were related clonally to the non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The V genes carried <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> (a hallmark of germinal-center B cells and their descendants) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both patients, some <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> were shared by the Reed-Sternberg and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, whereas other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> were found exclusively in one or the other cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In two patients with classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and non-Hodgkin's B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we identified a common B-cell precursor, probably a germinal-center B-cell, for both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that the two types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> underwent both shared and distinct transforming events and provides proof of the B-cell derivation of Reed-Sternberg cells in classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
