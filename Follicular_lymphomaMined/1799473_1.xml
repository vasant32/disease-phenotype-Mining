<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Responding patients are then randomized to receive either interferon alfa-2b maintenance therapy for up to 12 months or no further treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred and eight patients are evaluable for response, the remainder are still receiving initial therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical remission (complete or good partial remission) was achieved in 42/59 (71%) patients receiving <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> alone and in 27/49 (55%) patients receiving the combination (P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preliminary analysis of remission duration shows a trend in favour of those patients receiving interferon throughout (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is no significant difference between the groups in terms of survival, at a median follow up of 2.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interferon-associated toxicity was minor in most patients but led to discontinuation of therapy in six cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Larger trials with longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm the beneficial role of interferon in the treatment of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
