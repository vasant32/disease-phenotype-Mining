<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It shows a follicular pattern lacking mantle zones, with a network of interfollicular dendritic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transformation to more aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is documented, but the only connections to mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are described cases of composite <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> consisting of these 2 entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We discuss here a case of a lymph node harboring CD20, CD10, BCL2, BCL6, cyclin D1, CD5, Ki67, and SOX11 with CD21, showing an almost intact network of dendritic cells in one part of a lymph node, and CD20, CD5, SOX11, BCL6, cyclin D1, CD10, Ki67, and CD21 cells restricted to the mantle area in another part of the same lymph node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both parts of the lymph node had BCL2 rearrangement, a lack of t(11:14)(q13;q32), the presence of SOX11 expression, and the same clonal band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The described case suggests heterogenous development of small cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and indicates the possibility of differentiation regression </plain></SENT>
