<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rituximab is indicated: as the first-line treatment of diffuse-large B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHOP); as the first-line treatment of stage III-IV follicular NHL in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (CVP); for the treatment of patients with stage III-IV follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who are chemoresistant or in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy; and as maintenance therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> responding to induction therapy with chemotherapy with or without rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This article reviews the published economic evaluations of rituximab in the treatment of NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The conclusion of these analyses is that rituximab, used both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy, is a cost-effective intervention in the most common forms of NHL, diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there exists a paucity of published studies on both the clinical and economic analysis of rituximab in the less common NHLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Currently, rituximab is being evaluated in clinical trials within other NHLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If it has the same clinical success in these trials as it has had in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, then it is possible that within a few years rituximab could play a key role in treating patients in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> forms of NHL </plain></SENT>
