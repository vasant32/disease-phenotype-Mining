<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Optimization of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, in particular by amplifying its effectors, could further increase the efficacy of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the cytotoxic activity of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells against follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and whether this killing could be increased by promoting antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, in particular a type-II glycoengineered anti-CD20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vγ9Vδ2 T cells were expanded in vitro in the presence of bromohydrin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">pyrophosphate</z:chebi> (Phosphostim) and interleukin-2 and their ability to kill follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> primary cells or cell lines was evaluated by flow cytometry cytotoxic T-lymphocyte assays in the presence or absence of three anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies: the afucosylated GA101, the chimeric rituximab or the humanized ofatumumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ability of these cells to release perforin/granzyme and secrete interferon-γ when co-cultured with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> primary cells or cell lines in the presence or not of the three anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies was also evaluated by CD107a staining and Elispot assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Phosphostim and interleukin-2 expanded Vγ9Vδ2 T cells were cytotoxic to primary follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and their cytotoxic potential was dramatically increased by GA101, a type II glycoengineered anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, and to a lesser extent, by rituximab and ofatumumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increased cytotoxicity was associated with increased secretion of perforin/granzyme and interferon-γ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In-vitro expanded Vγ9Vδ2 T cells efficiently kill primary follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and express CD16; anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, in particular GA101, dramatically increase the cytotoxic activity of expanded Vγ9Vδ2 T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These preclinical results prompt the development of clinical trials using this antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity property of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
