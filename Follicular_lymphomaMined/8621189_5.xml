<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The recently described marginal zone cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (MZCL) is a B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> characterized by concentric expansion of cells around the follicle, with or without infiltration of the mantle zone or germinal center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene is rearranged although none of the MZCL reported have been shown to be positive for the bcl-2 gene translocation by molecular studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report a patient with FL showing preferential involvement of the marginal zone of spleen morphologically mimicking a primary splenic MZCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient reported here had a well-documented previous lymph node diagnosis of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The immunoglobulin heavy chain gene and bcl-2 gene rearrangement analysis confirmed the clonal origin of both the original FL, as well as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, with a marginal zone pattern in the spleen </plain></SENT>
