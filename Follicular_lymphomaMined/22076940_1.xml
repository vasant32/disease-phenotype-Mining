<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: CD80 is a member of the B7 family of immune coregulatory proteins that mediate both immune activation and suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD80 in particular has recently been shown to play an important role in supporting immune suppression through interactions with B7-H1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD80 has been identified as a therapeutic target in non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) based on limited immunohistochemical studies of CD80 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies have shown that the anti-CD80 antibody galiximab is safe and clinically efficacious in follicular NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms through which targeting CD80 inhibits <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> remain poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To further define the potential of CD80 as a therapeutic target in NHL, CD80 expression was evaluated by multicolor flow cytometric analysis of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell suspensions generated from 241 diagnostic biopsies of patients with NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CD80 was expressed on malignant B cells in essentially <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (97%; n = 115), the majority of cases of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (90%; n = 69), marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (91%; n = 22), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (75%; n = 12), and in about half of small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases (43%; n = 23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD80 was also present on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-infiltrating T lymphocytes in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, CD80 was expressed by non-B, non-T cells in 68 and 44% of cases of follicular and diffuse large B-cell NHL, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CD80 is expressed on both malignant cells and the nonmalignant cells in NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic targeting of CD80 will therefore modulate the complex intercellular interactions that define the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> microenvironment in NHL </plain></SENT>
