<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The c-yes-1 and bcl-2 genes have been independently mapped at the same position of the chromosome band, 18q21.3, which is a breakpoint in the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High-molecular-weight genomic DNAs and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> isolated from a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line FL-18 and an Epstein-Barr virus harboring FL-18EB cell line, which carried the t(14;18), were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although there was no detectable c-yes rearrangement, the chromosome 18-specific probe b (bcl-2) revealed one rearranged fragment after EcoRI, BamHI, PstI and SstI digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, breakage of chromosome 18 in the t(14;18) occurred at the SstI fragment containing the probe b sequence on the bcl-2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The transcript of c-yes was undetectable, whereas active transcription of bcl-2 was observed in the FL-18 and FL-18EB cell lines at a higher level than in other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the c-yes-1 is not involved in the t(14;18), and the 2 genes located at 18q21.3 are independent sequences </plain></SENT>
