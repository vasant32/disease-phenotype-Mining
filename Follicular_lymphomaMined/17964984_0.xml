<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The average age of patients was 18 to 73 years old with a median age at 50.83 years old and a sex ratio of 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical characteristics of patients are mainly represented by advance stage with 70% of stage III and IV of Ann Arbor classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histological, we mainly notified follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> constituted of small cells 50%, followed by mixed follicular and large cells <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with respectively 27.78 and 22.22% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using varieties of therapeutics regiments, we obtained 41.67% of complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were significant correlations between complete remission and histology subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> constituted by large cells and mixed cells had higher rate of complete remission with respectively 46.67% and 40% in relation with those of small cells with a higher failure rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 24 months, the estimated 5-years overall survival and event-free survival were 22% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After a long period, 25 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> have been reported, 5 cases of losing sight and 6 patients are still alive and following treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results are lowers than the reported case in developing country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This none satisfying was in relation with the lower socio-economical level of the main part of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The short survival delay time of our patients didn't permit time to observe transformation case in diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
