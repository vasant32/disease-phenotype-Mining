<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This risk, however, is significantly elevated in patients receiving human leukocyte antigen (HLA) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">mis</z:e>-matched or T-cell-depleted grafts, or after treatment for severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GvHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An 18-yr-old patient with positive Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serology received a fully matched, unmanipulated bone marrow graft from an unrelated EBV-positive donor for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) in second complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GvHD prophylaxis was performed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA) and a short course of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four months after Tx, the patient developed ulcerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011110'>tonsillitis</z:hpo> that was unresponsive to antibiotic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>Diarrhea</z:hpo> appearing simultaneously was interpreted as gastrointestinal GvHD and steroids were added to CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A few days later the patient was admitted to hospital because of generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite reduction of immunosuppression, intensification of anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> treatment, and subsequent mechanical ventilation, the patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> 6 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Autopsy demonstrated disseminated EBV-induced, multi-nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> infiltration of the entire colon but no signs of GvHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, both lungs, paratracheal lymph nodes, kidneys, thyroid gland, and liver were infiltrated with large B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This case underlines the rapid and aggressive course of EBV-induced disseminated PTLD after HSCT, initially mimicking intestinal GvHD because of massive colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Tissue biopsies should be performed early for establishing correct diagnosis, thus enabling specific therapy, e.g. infusion of donor leukocytes with cytotoxic T-lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
