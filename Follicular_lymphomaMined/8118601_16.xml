<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the ability of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect this rearrangement in fixed-tissue samples, we studied 48 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> using DNA extracted from paired samples of fresh-frozen tissue and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A standard <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="59" ids="35255">chloroform</z:chebi> DNA extraction method was used for both types of tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rearrangements of the major breakpoint region (MBR) and minor cluster sequence (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e>) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three segments of the human beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> gene were also amplified to estimate the degree of DNA degradation in the fixed-tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PCR of fresh-tissue (intact) DNA revealed amplifiable products in 29 of the 48 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (60%), whereas the fixed-tissue (degraded) DNA studies were positive in 24 (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MBR products were detected in 24 fresh-tissue samples, and varied from 80 bp to &gt; 1.5 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty of these cases yielded MBR products in the corresponding fixed-tissue DNA, ranging from 80 to 276 bp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five fresh-tissue and four fixed-tissue samples produced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> segments that ranged from 340 bp to 1.2 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four of the five samples with no detectable MBR or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> translocations using degraded DNA had products greater than 1.0 kb in the fresh-tissue studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A 175-bp segment of the beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> gene was amplified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 29 fixed-tissue samples; a 324 bp fragment was produced in 20 samples (69%), and a 676 bp segment was detected in 13 (45%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
