<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirteen cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the small cell and large cell types were examined by map-guided computerized microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initially, each specimen was digitized over a 5,120- X -5,120-microns area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follicle maps depicting well-defined follicles were generated from these digitized images and used to guide a robot microscope to examine follicular center cells using from 20 to 100 fields, each 160 X 160 microns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mathematical <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was used to estimate the number of connected regions within each field examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on the assumption that each connected region corresponded to a cell nucleus, it was expected that the number of connected regions found per unit area would correlate with the number of cells per unit area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three prototypical small cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and three prototypical large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were used as a training set to calibrate the methodology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data obtained on these prototypical cases were used to establish statistical decision boundaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven test cases, judged to be less typical but classifiable by experts, were then examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five of the seven were classified correctly, and the remaining two were identified as outliers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that subclassification of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> may be aided by computerized microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This pilot feasibility study is currently being expanded using a much larger sample of case material </plain></SENT>
