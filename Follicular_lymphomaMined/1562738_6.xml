<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The presence of the translocation t(8;14)(q24;q32) has not been well described in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a consecutive series of 278 karyotypically abnormal non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL), six patients with FL showing a t(8;14) without a t(14;18)(q32;q21) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They ranged in age from 45 to 73 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cell type was mixed in four patients, small-cleaved in one, and large-cleaved in one; four cases also contained diffuse areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases tested displayed monoclonal surface Ig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical courses were consistent with the histologic subtypes, being less aggressive than other t(8;14)-bearing NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In five cases, frozen tissue was available for Southern blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The BCL2 gene showed a germline configuration when studied with the MBR, MCR, and 5' cDNA probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The MYC gene also appeared unrearranged using an exon-1 probe with EcoRI or HindIII digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the Ig heavy chain (IgH) gene with a JH region probe and BamHI or EcoRI digestion showed only one rearranged band in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, indicating that the 14q32 breakpoint did not lie in either the J or switch-mu (SM) regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In four cases, the exon-1/intron-1 border of the MYC gene, a target area for point mutations in cases of t(8;14) that do not display rearrangements of the MYC gene, was enzymatically amplified and sequenced; no point mutations were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The indolent behavior of our six cases, and the finding that the molecular structure of the t(8;14) in these cases does not follow the pattern of breakpoint sites and point mutations defined in other histologic subtypes of NHL with this translocation, suggest that the t(8;14) in these cases is cytogenetically and molecularly distinct from the t(8;14) seen in high-grade NHLs, and is relatively ineffectual in terms of MYC deregulation, or that other genetic elements at these chromosomal sites may be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further analysis of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> may provide insights into MYC deregulation and BCL2-independent FL </plain></SENT>
