<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The balance between proapoptotic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> and prosurvival <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37550">sphingosine-1-phosphate</z:chebi>, sometimes termed the "<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26739">sphingolipid</z:chebi> rheostat," has received particular attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Less well studied is the role of the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> variant translocation 1 (FVT1) gene, which was identified through its involvement in an atypical follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> translocation and which encodes an enzyme in the synthetic pathway of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the expression of FVT1 in a variety of B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and found that FVT1 is significantly underexpressed by germinal center-type diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) when compared with non-germinal center-type <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tonsil control samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased expression of FVT1 correlated with decreased survival, suggesting that changes in the expression of FVT1 and in the concentrations of bioactive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26739">sphingolipids</z:chebi> may be important in the pathogenesis and treatment of some types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
