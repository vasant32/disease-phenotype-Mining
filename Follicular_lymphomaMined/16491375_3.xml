<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reporting of such cases is important because they pose major biologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic dilemmas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we describe the third reported case of mantle cell and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed accurate immunohistochemical and molecular studies to define the mono- vs biclonal nature of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used both manual and LASER-capture microdissection combined to multiple molecular approaches for clonality determination, including detection of heavy and light chain recombination, as well as presence of kappa/Kde recombination and sequence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By immunohistochemistry and FISH, we confirmed the presence of two distinct <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> types characterized by specific translocations [namely, t(11;14) and t(14;18)], while we demonstrated two distinct and not clonally related cell populations by molecular techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The light chain approach, and particularly the kappa and kappa/Kde recombination detection, proved very useful for solving the clonality issue </plain></SENT>
