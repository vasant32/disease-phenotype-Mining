<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> an innate defect in the T-cell repertoire could account for the impaired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-specific immune response; alternatively, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> itself could exert an inhibitory effect on the immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To address this issue we analysed the T-cell responses against follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) in identical twins as it can be postulated that their overall T-cell repertoire is identical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While differences between the T-cell response of the patient and the healthy twin would point to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-induced T-cell unresponsiveness, impaired responses in both would point to a defective T-cell repertoire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated an impaired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-specific proliferation (P = 0.035 and P = 0.013) and cytokine release (P = 0.004 and P = 0.0008) of both peripheral blood and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-derived T-cells, respectively, in the FL patient compared with the T-cell response of the healthy twin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, only syngeneic primed T cells were able to directly lyse unmodified FL cells of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data support previous findings in murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and suggest that inhibitory mechanisms during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour growth</z:e>, rather than a defective T-cell repertoire, are responsible for the insufficient T-cell response in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
