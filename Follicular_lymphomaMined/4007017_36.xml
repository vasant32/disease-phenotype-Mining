<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were no remarkable differences in the distribution of age, sex and the location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> between Japanese NHL and the disease in Western races </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histologically, however, several differences were present; in particular, the lower frequencies of nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of nodal origin and lymphocytic type of nodal and extranodal origin in the present cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>About 10% of the cases show a peculiar histology characteristic for adult T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From this study, it appears that the ratio of low-grade malignant NHL in Japan is much lower than in the Western countries </plain></SENT>
