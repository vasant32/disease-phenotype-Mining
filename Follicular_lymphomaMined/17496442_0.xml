<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> has become the treatment of choice in initial treatment, and its long-term effectiveness and safety have been confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> agent is believed to be the standard treatment in first remission induction therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To improve the efficacy of the first remission induction chemotherapy, the addition of gemutuzumab ozogamicin has been investigated intensively <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> over the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there are many obstacles to conducting its clinical trial in Japan </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>But the number of transplantations and the timing of second transplantation need more investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Considering the overall situation with regard to the standard treatments of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> in Japan, there is little difference in practice from western countries </plain></SENT>
