<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD44 expression was immunohistochemically examined in 167 well characterized cases of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (MLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of 12 nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs) were CD44+, whereas 3 of 4 extranodal ones showed distinct CD44 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast to nodal FLs, 28 of the 38 (74%) nodal diffuse B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were CD44+ (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed a significantly higher expression of CD44 antigen than diffuse B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in the nodal cases (p &lt; 0.04), but not in the extranodal ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In nodal diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 3 of 5 stage I <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (60%) were CD44+ in contrast to 53 of 63 stage II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (84%), but the difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 14 Hodgkin's diseases, 9 cases were CD44+ with no significant correlation with clinical stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data of flow cytometric analysis confirmed the results of immunohistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, CD44 expression is relevant to primary sites of distinctive MLs originating in the mucosal regions (MALToma) and some histological subtypes, but the relation with clinical stage was not defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules or different mechanisms must also be taken into account concerning the genesis and the expansion of MLs </plain></SENT>
