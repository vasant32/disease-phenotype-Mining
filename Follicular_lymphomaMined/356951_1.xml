<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were slightly more common in females and were clustered in the age range 30 to 90 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were slightly more common in males; the age distribution was bimodal, with one peak in the age range 10 to 19 years and the other in the age range 60 to 69 years, but when the age distribution of the general population in which the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> occurred was taken into account, the incidence of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was found to be significantly higher (P &lt; 0.001) in persons more than 69 years of age than in those 40 to 69 years of age.SURVIVAL CORRELATED WITH HISTOPATHOLOGIC TYPE: persons with nodular (follicular) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and diffuse lymphocytic well differentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had a significantly greater survival (P &lt; 0.05) than those with other diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in survival was noticed between persons with nodal and extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>.While Rappaport and colleagues' criteria are still very useful, it is important to recognize the nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> as a specific entity requiring generally different management from diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Appreciation of the different biologic behaviour of the various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is important to clinicians planning therapy </plain></SENT>
