<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> have a germinal center origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have applied mutational analyses and a novel algorithm for quantifying shape properties of mutational lineage trees to investigate the nature of the diversification, somatic hypermutation and selection processes that affect B cell clones in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and reveal whether they differ from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lineage tree analysis demonstrated higher diversification and mutations per cell in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was caused solely by the longer diversification times of the malignant clones, as their recent diversification processes were similar to those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> responses, implying similar mutation frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since previous analyses of antigen-driven selection were shown to yield false positives, we performed a corrected analysis of replacement and silent mutation patterns, which revealed selection against replacement mutations in the framework regions, responsible for the structural integrity of the B cell receptor, but not for positive selection for replacements in the complementary determining regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most replacements, however, were neutral or conservative, suggesting that if at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> selection operates in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> it is for structural B cell receptor integrity but not for antigen binding </plain></SENT>
