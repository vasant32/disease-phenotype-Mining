<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper describes a series from a population based study of 24 patients with L3 ALL presenting over 17 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical data were collected prospectively from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adult patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> in the Northern region since 1982 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with FAB type L3 ALL were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, L3 ALL accounts for 8.6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751606" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adult ALL</z:e> and it is more common in the elderly than has hitherto been recognised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to classic Burkitt-type translocations (11 of 24 cases), the t(14;18) translocation, which is characteristically found in lower grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> such as follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, is frequently present (five of 24 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of L3 ALL is often associated with non-Burkitt-type translocations and the presence of a t(14;18) translocation may indicate that in some cases a clinically non-apparent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo>, such as a low grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, has transformed to a more aggressive form and, thus, presents as a de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
