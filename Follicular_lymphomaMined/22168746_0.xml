<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we attempted to clarify the significance of AID associated with c-myc in the progression of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) using RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tissues from the patients with grade 3 FL expressed relatively higher levels of c-myc and AID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The samples taken from a patient with FL who died within 2 years after the start of treatment showed either no or low expression of AID, despite expressing high levels of c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to examine the role of AID expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> FL, the full-length AID transcript was transfected into AID-negative cell lines established from different patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This led to the establishment of AID-expressing transfectants with a low proliferation rate and a significantly increased incidence of G(0)/G(1) arrest compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that AID may act as a negative regulator of cell survival in FL when sufficient c-myc is expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Switch-off or low expression of AID after c-myc amplification may correlate with the clinical outcomes of FL </plain></SENT>
