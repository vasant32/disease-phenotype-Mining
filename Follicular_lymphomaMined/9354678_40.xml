<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>Somatic mutations</z:hpo> or other changes in P53 have been reported in numerous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types, and in some of these, they are associated with poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined 237 cytogenetically characterized B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (B-NHLs) for somatic changes in P53 by Southern blot analysis, by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP) of exon 5 through 9, and by direct sequencing of SSCP variants to determine the frequency and types of mutations and their clinical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a portion of these (173 tumors), we also studied p53 expression by immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On Southern blots, no gross change was identified in P53 and no mutation was identified in exon 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In exons 5 through 8, 27 different mutations were identified in 25 patients (23 single-base substitutions, 3 deletions, 1 duplication) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutations in P53 were identified in 25 of 237 tumors (10.5%), which included 1 of 45 small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLLs</z:e>), 2 of 38 follicular small cleaved-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FSCCs), 2 of 35 follicular mixed small cleaved-cell and large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FMxs), 1 of 4 follicular large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLCs), 1 of 14 diffuse small cleaved-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DSCCs), 2 of 17 diffuse mixed small- and large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DMxs), and 16 of 84 diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DLCCs); the difference between the histologic groups was significant (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (MC) patients, 3 of 10 had mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 16 patients, the mutation was identified in specimens obtained at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mutation of transition type and transversion type occurred at a relative frequency of 2:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirty percent occurred at CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> sequences and the codon for arginine was most frequently affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nineteen of 99 tumors with complex cytogenetic abnormalities, but none of 69 tumors with simple cytogenetic abnormalities, had mutations (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Similarly, 11 of 25 tumors with an abnormality of 17p and 8 of 143 tumors with apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 17p had mutations (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Positive correlations were found between a mutation and p53 expression (P &lt; .001), between missense type mutations and p53 expression (P &lt; .005), and between 17p abnormalities and p53 expression (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two of 49 patients without mutation and 14 of 17 patients with mutations died (P &lt; .05), but there was no significant difference in median survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Similarly, 21 of 26 p53 positive patients died, whereas only 1 of 24 p53-negative patients died on-study (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Among p53-negative patients, mutation (P &lt; .01) was positively associated with a fatal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that in B-NHL, somatic changes in P53 were present in diagnostic specimens of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> histologic types, but at a higher frequency in DLC and MC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>P53 mutation and/or expression has a negative influence on survival, and therefore can serve as prognostic indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining for p53 is an effective way to screen for P53 changes in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
