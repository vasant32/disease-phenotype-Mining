<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most nodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with monocytoid B cell/marginal zone differentiation exhibit the morphologic and immunophenotypical characteristics of extranodal MALT-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To clarify the relationship between nodal and extranodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZLs</z:e> and to investigate the possible existence of a nodal variant of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e>, 36 MZL initially considered to be primary nodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with marginal zone differentiation were excluded (small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>/CLL], follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZLs</z:e> showed morphologic and phenotypic characteristics similar to those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e>, whereas 30 tumors were more similar to MALT-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were IgD positive (6/6) but cyclin D1 (0/5), CD5 (0/6), and CD23 (0/6) negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five of these patients came for treatment in stage I or II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patient manifested <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, peripheral blood, and/or bone marrow infiltration either at diagnosis or during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lymph nodes from 30 patients with MALT-type features showed a perisinusoidal and perivascular infiltration of monocytoid/centrocytoid cells and residual germinal centers with a relatively well-preserved mantle cuff </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The neoplastic cells were negative for IgD (0/17), cyclin D1 (0/8), and CD5 (0/12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seven of 16 (44%) patients with a detailed history and clinical follow-up had evidence of extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that most nodal B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with marginal zone differentiation are of the MALT type and that they are frequently associated with an extranodal component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition, a primary nodal counterpart of splenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> also exists, and may occur in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
