<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The PRIMA (Primary Rituximab and Maintenance) study established 2 years of maintenance rituximab (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) as a standard of care for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) patients who achieve an objective response after induction chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 17% improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared with those who did not receive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the decision to stop <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> after 2 years was arbitrary, and the PRIMA study reports only short-term follow-up of 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Longer series on FL outcomes describe ubiquitous relapse and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The optimal duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> is under investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Herein, we report our experience with prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, the outcome of 25 consecutive, unselected, previously untreated patients with low-grade high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden FL in need for treatment is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients achieved a partial or complete response to induction immunochemotherapy and received ongoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 5.0 years and 5.2 years mean duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>, there are no relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> have occurred, unrelated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> treatment has been well-tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004313'>Hypogammaglobulinemia</z:hpo> is the only observed adverse event, with only one patient requiring monthly intravenous gamma globulin infusions due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006532'>recurrent pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There has been no discontinuation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> or refusal to remain on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These provocative long-term results suggest that continuous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> beyond 2 years is safe and may be associated with prolonged PFS in patients with FL who achieve an objective response after immunochemotherapy </plain></SENT>
