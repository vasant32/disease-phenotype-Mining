<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here a Japanese female with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who subsequently developed PML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to JCV, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) was detected in the affected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> of the patient by polymerase chain reaction and by in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HHV-6, recognized as a neurotropic virus, is known to be reactivated during immunosuppression and can cause fatal complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is likely that impaired immunity associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the additional immunosuppression following cytopenia-inducing chemotherapies predisposed the patient to reactivated HHV-6 infection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although it remains to be clarified whether HHV-6 plays an important role as a co-agent with JCV in causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> of the brain, our observation alerts physicians to the possible association of HHV-6 with the pathogenesis of PML </plain></SENT>
