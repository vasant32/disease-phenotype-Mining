<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few studies have examined the role of circadian genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current study examined Cryptochrome 2 (CRY2), a core circadian gene and transcriptional repressor, as a potential circadian biomarker for NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We first performed genetic association analyses of tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in CRY2 and NHL risk using DNA samples from a population-based case-control study (n = 455 cases and 527 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three SNPs were found to be significantly associated with risk of NHL when combining <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes [dbSNP IDs, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals: rs11038689, OR, 2.34 (1.28-4.27), P = 0.006; rs7123390, OR, 2.40 (1.39-4.13), P = 0.002; and rs1401417, OR, 2.97 (1.57-5.63, P = 0.001)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each of these associations remained significant when restricting the analysis to B-cell cases and when further restricting to follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An analysis of CRY2 diplotypes confirmed these significant findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To further determine the functional effect of CRY2, we silenced the gene in vitro and performed a whole genome expression microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A pathway-based analysis showed that genes significantly altered by CRY2 knockdown formed networks associated with immune response and hematologic system development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, these genes were predicted to have significant effects on several disease processes, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (B-H P = 3.75E(-9)) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disease</z:e> (B-H P = 8.01E(-8)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, both genetic association and functional analyses suggest that the circadian gene CRY2 may play an important role in NHL development </plain></SENT>
