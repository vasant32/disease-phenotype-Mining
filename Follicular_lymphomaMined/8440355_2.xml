<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical and hematologic features at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of this phase were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells expressed monoclonal surface immunoglobulins with moderate to strong intensity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 of the patients diagnosed as leukemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Various B-cell associated antigens were expressed as follows: CD19 (5/6), CD20 (7/7), and CD10 (6/7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reactivity to these markers was comparable in the lymph node and blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD38 antigen was much lower in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells of the blood than in those of the lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic studies of the lymph nodes of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in leukemic phase revealed a common chromosomal aberration, of t(14;18)(q32;q21) and +18, in 2 patients successfully analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in the leukemic phase in these patients in Akita, Japan, were consistent with those in the West with respect to <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, immunology and cytogenetics, the high incidence of leukemic manifestations may be a salient feature of Japanese cases </plain></SENT>
