<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We started a controlled clinical trial to assess if interferon alpha 2b could improve outcome, measured with event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with FL in complete remission after chemotherapy based <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> and adjuvant radiotherapy to sites of initial bulky disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three hundred and eighty four patients in complete response after 6 cycles of CEOP-Bleo (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47898">epirubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi>, at standard doses), and adjuvant radiotherapy when necessary, were randomized to received Interferon alpha 2b, three times a week for 1 year or no treatment (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median follow up was 9.8 years (range 7.0-15 years); actuarial curves showed that EFS was 64% (95% confidence interval (CI) 56-71%) in patients treated with interferon that was statistically significant to patients in the control group: 35% (95% CI: 28-43%) (p&lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OS was also statistically significant: 81% in patients treated with interferon (95% CI: 74-93%) and 57% (95% CI: 50-63%) in the control group (p&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was mild, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients received the planned dose of interferon on time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The use of aggressive chemotherapy and maintenance therapy with interferon alpha 2b in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> improved outcome; more than 60% of patients remain alive free of disease at longer follow-up </plain></SENT>
