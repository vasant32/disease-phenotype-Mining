<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe here the clinical, morphological, immunological, cytogenetic and molecular findings from 37 cases of t(14;18)-positive CLPD, identified from our series of non-FL B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (n=993) that were routinely analysed in peripheral blood by conventional cytogenetics analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The FL diagnosis was excluded by <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunology (the samples were CD10 negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The BCL2 translocations were observed in 22 CLL cases, including 7 monoclonal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo> (MBL) cases re-classified according to the new International Workshop on CLL criteria, six small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>) cases, 1 splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e>) case and eight cases of unclassifiable CLPD with overlapping CLL/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the CLL cases, the IGH/BCL2 fusion was remarkably associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 12 (13/22) and mutated IGHV status (20/21) and did not affect the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, most of these CLLs harboured a low mutation load of BCL6 gene and unmutated FAS (CD95) loci, which points to a post-germinal-centre cellular origin </plain></SENT>
