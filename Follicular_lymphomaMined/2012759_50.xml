<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We here describe 13 patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and a translocation t(11:14)(q13:q32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were part of a series of 163 patients with NHL and an abnormal karyotype, serially referred to our institution between January 1984 and 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with t(11:14) seem to present several common and interesting features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Males are more frequently affected than females, and old people more than young </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They present at diagnosis with advanced disease and usually show involvement of epithelium and bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With respect to histologic diagnoses, these patients are usually considered to be of low-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, most of them do very poorly, have short complete remission and frequent relapses whatever the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a whole, the median survival rate is rather low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cytologic, histologic as well as the immunologic patterns tend to be uniform: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> are composed of small cells and display features of mantle zone/intermediate lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They express high IgM and low IgD levels and more commonly bear Ig lambda light chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They also express <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pan-B antigens (except CD23) as well as the CD5 antigen, but usually lack the CD10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>According to these characteristics, these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> could be placed in between lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (which usually express CD23) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (which commonly lack IgD and CD5 and bear CD10 as well as a t(14:18) </plain></SENT>
