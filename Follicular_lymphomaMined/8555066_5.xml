<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this report a follicular non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) carrying an unusual t(14;18) is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This translocation most likely occurred during the VH to D-JH rearrangement process of the IgH locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From the data combined with data from the literature we conclude that the chance for development of a t(14;18) decreases during progression of the immunoglobulin rearrangement process in the pre-B-cell ontogeny </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is probably due to decreased accessibility of the bcl-2 locus by reduced transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analysed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> pattern of the productively rearranged IgH gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Like other follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> were present in this gene and indicated positive selection, probably for an antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found no evidence for ongoing induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that bcl-2 gene deregulation, but not the precise moment at which this occurs during the pre-B-cell stage, influences the development of follicular NHL </plain></SENT>
