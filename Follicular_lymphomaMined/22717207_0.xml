<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of FL is based on morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics found on tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our project's aim is to develop computer-aided analysis tools on virtual slide images (VSI) of lymphoid tissues with the purpose of improving the FL grading performed in malignant follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we focus on the first step of our work, an automated system for detecting follicles in VSI of lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To mimic the human expert process, the system works on low-resolution CD20 images and maps the follicle boundaries on high-resolution H&amp;E images </plain></SENT>
