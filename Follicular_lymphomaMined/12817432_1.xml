<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the level of HLA-DO expression is a helpful marker in the differential diagnosis between florid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we analyzed single-cell suspensions from 29 lymph node specimens by 4-color flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 29 specimens, 7 were from patients with florid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo>, in which the clonality of the germinal center B cells (GCBCs) was indeterminate by flow cytometric immunophenotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining 22 cases were follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; neoplastic cells in 2 of these cases lacked expression of surface immunoglobulin light chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of HLA-DO expression in the reactive CD10+ GCBCs in florid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> was markedly down-regulated compared with the CD10- polytypic B cells of the same specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the level of HLA-DO expression in the CD10+ neoplastic cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was similar to that of the CD10- polytypic B cells, thus higher than the reactive CD10+ GCBCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This difference was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that HLA-DO is a useful marker to differentiate florid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> by flow cytometry, particularly when clonality of the CD10+ B cells is in question </plain></SENT>
