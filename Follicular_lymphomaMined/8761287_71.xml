<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The prototypic mammalian regulator of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is bcl-2, the oncogene implicated in the development of human follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several homologues of bcl-2 are now known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a PCR-based strategy we cloned a novel member of this gene family, denoted bcl-w </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The gene, which is highly conserved between mouse and human, resides near the T-cell antigen receptor alpha gene within the central portion of mouse chromosome 14 and on human chromosome 14 at band q11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Enforced expression of bcl-w rendered lymphoid and myeloid cells refractory to several (but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) cytotoxic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, like Bcl-2 and Bcl-x, the Bcl-w protein promotes cell survival, in contrast to other close homologues, Bax and Bak, which facilitate cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the expected amino acid sequence of Bcl-w with that of these relatives helps to delineate residues likely to convey survival or anti-survival function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While expression of bcl-w was uncommon in B or T lymphoid cell lines, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was observed in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> murine myeloid cell lines analysed and in a wide range of tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that bcl-w participates in the control of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in multiple cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Its functional similarity to bcl-2 also makes it an attractive candidate proto-oncogene </plain></SENT>
