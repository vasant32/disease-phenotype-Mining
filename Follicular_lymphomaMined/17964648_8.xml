<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to test the usefulness of two different techniques, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and PCR to detect t(14;18) in FL at diagnosis in paraffin-embedded tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 51 patients diagnosed of FL were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FISH was performed with dual color dual fusion commercial probes (VYSIS) and in PCR experiments, the BIOMED-2 primers covering MBR, mcr and 3'MBR regions were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FISH showed positivity for the IgH/BCL2 translocation in 96% of patients and PCR in 59% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FISH was able to detect variant translocations involving light chain Ig, or showing variant patterns such as deletions of the IgH portion involved in translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 4% of cases, the IgH/BCL2 translocation was not detected by any of the two techniques tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results show that FISH represents the best technique to detect t(14;18) at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
