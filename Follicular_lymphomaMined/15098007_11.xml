<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Completion of the human genome project has focused scientific attention on the development of methods that permit rapid characterization of proteins that are encoded by the genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent improvements in two-dimensional separation techniques in combination with protein identification software/databases and mass spectrometry (MS) now permit rapid comprehensive large-scale analysis of individual proteins within <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33837">complex protein</z:chebi> mixtures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have performed pairwise comparisons of low-grade and transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs) in order to identify proteins that may be involved in FL progression using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (ProteinChip, Ciphergen Biosystems) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This system utilizes preactivated differential binding surfaces to achieve multidimensional chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The protein-bound chips were then analyzed by a SELDI-TOF mass spectrometer to generate protein profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In preliminary experiments, we established that the MS data obtained from SELDI-TOF MS were reproducible, and that reduction in sample complexity improved the ability to detect lower abundance proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With specific regard to FL transformation, we rapidly identified a number of potential candidate proteins involved in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These included an upregulated 32 kDa protein and a down-regulated 11.8 kDa protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Protein database searches revealed several candidates, among them cyclin D3 (32.5 kDa) and caspase 3 (11.8 kDa) whose differential expression were confirmed by immunoblotting and/or immunohistochemical analysis on the primary tissue specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our studies demonstrate the utility of SELDI-TOF-MS for the rapid discovery of differentially expressed proteins using femtomolar quantities of crude protein derived from biopsy material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The versatility of this methodology supports its application to the rapid discovery of potential biomarkers in a variety of cellular systems </plain></SENT>
