<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the bcl-2/IgH fusion gene was present in 57% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and that this translocation was also present in 33% of the reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The over expression of bcl-2 protein was found in 78% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, but none in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo>, therefore bcl-2 protein staining may be a useful immunohistochemical method to differentiate follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
