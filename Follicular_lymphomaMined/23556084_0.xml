<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the charts of 137 patients (53% female, 87% White, age 61.0 ± 12.4 years) who received either R-M (n = 53) or OBS (n = 84) after chemotherapy induction for newly diagnosed FL at community <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> practices within the US </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients (65% with advanced disease; 48% with a high FLIPI score [3-5]) had completed ≥1 Patient Care Monitor HRQoL survey in the period following front-line therapy, and were excluded if they had progressed during front-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Linear mixed models showed that postinduction, most symptoms were stable, with patients on R-M reporting HRQoL that was equal to that reported by OBS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among R-M patients, receipt of rituximab was associated with improved psychological symptoms </plain></SENT>
