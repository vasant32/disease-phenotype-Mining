<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we have evaluated whether gender has prognostic impact on the survival of patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the postrituximab era of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study populations consisted of 217 diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and 110 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) patients treated with immunochemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hundred and sixty chemotherapy-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> patients served as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to Kaplan-Meier analyses, female patients had a significantly better progression-free survival than men both in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (4 yr PFS 75% vs. 60%; P= 0.013) and in FL (4 yr PFS 68% vs. 52%, P=0.036) patients treated with immunochemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In chemotherapy-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> patients, no difference in survival between the genders was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results support the idea that women seem to respond better to rituximab </plain></SENT>
