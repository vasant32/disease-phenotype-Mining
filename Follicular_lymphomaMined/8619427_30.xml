<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 37 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> found to have BCL1/cyclin D1 (PRAD1, CCND1) gene rearrangements, 30 fit the morphologic and immunophenotypic criteria for typical CC/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven cases with morphologic features atypical for CC/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD5+ monoclonal B cells were documented in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six cases were subsequently stained for cyclin D1 protein, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed nuclear positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five cases had variably sized foci of cells with moderately abundant pale cytoplasm resembling parafollicular/monocytoid B cells, marginal zone cells, hairy cells, or even proliferation centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transformed-appearing cells were also present in some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one case, striking follicular colonization created a markedly nodular growth pattern mimicking a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A sixth case had a marked predominance of small, round lymphocytes at some sites, mimicking a small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five of these six cases also had areas more typical of CC/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The seventh case was a CD5-positive splenic marginal zone-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e>) with plasmacytic differentiation and circulating villous lymphocytes consistent with a splenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with villous lymphocytes (SLVL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These cases illustrate the morphologic spectrum of small B-cell lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> that have BCL1/cyclin D1 gene rearrangements and overexpression of cyclin D1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite the BCL1 translocation and cyclin D1 overexpression, the splenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with plasmacytic differentiation was definitely not a CC/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> and fit the clinicopathologic entity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e>/SLVL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The other six cases are best considered CC/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> variants based on a combined morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genotypic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Genotypic or immunophenotypic studies to identify cyclin D1 rearrangements and overexpression, although not pathognomonic, are useful in recognizing these variant CC/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> cases, which can mimic almost any of the other well-described but more indolent low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Some of the variant CC/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> cases had features in common with the CD5+ cyclin D1+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e>/SLVL, suggesting a possible relationship between these two otherwise distinct entities </plain></SENT>
