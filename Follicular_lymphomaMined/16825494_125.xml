<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the impact of FOXP3-positive regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the progression and outcome of FL patients, we examined samples from 97 patients at diagnosis and 37 at first relapse with an anti-FOXP3 monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tregs were quantified using computerized image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival (OS) of the series was 9.9 years, and the FL International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) was prognostically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median Treg percentage at diagnosis was 10.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, 49 patients had more than 10% Tregs, 30 between 5% to 10%, and 19 less than 5%, with a 5-year OS of 80%, 74%, and 50%, respectively (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with very low numbers of Tregs (&lt; 5%) presented more frequently with refractory disease (P = .007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prognostic significance of Treg numbers was independent of the FLIPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven transformed diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e>) had lower Treg percentages (mean: 3.3%) than FL grades 1,2 (mean: 12.1%) or 3 (mean: 9%) (P &lt; .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, high Treg numbers predict improved survival of FL patients, while a marked reduction in Tregs is observed on transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
