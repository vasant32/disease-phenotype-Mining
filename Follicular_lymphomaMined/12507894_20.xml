<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Primary follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the gastrointestinal tract (GI-FL) is a rare so far poorly studied entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed four FL cases located in the small intestine and duodenum to gain insight in their pathogenesis and to find an explanation for their low tendency to disseminate outside the GI tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GI-FLs resemble nodal FLs with respect to <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and expression of typical GC markers such as CD10, CD38, and BCL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We established that the high levels of the anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> protein BCL-2 in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells are in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases due to a t(14;18) involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain and BCL-2 loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Detailed immunoglobulin gene analyses on microdissected tissue samples further supported the GC-cell derivation: GI-FLs carry extensively mutated variable heavy-chain genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mutation patterns indicated that at some time point in development stringent antigen receptor-based selection processes must have occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, three of four <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> expressed surface IgA, an immunoglobulin class typical of the mucosal immune system and seldom found in nodal FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to nodal FLs, the GI-FLs expressed the alpha4beta7 integrin, an established mucosa-homing receptor also expressed by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intestinal B and T lymphocytes and by low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the chemokine receptor CXCR3, expressed on low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, was not detected on the GI-FLs or on nodal FLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The combined data suggests that primary FL of the small intestine is a distinct entity that originates from local antigen-responsive B cells </plain></SENT>
