<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The recognition of several new types of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) in recent years has led to proposals for changing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> classifications, including a new proposal put forth by the International <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Study Group (ILSG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical significance of the new entities and the practical utility of this new proposal have not been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we performed a clinical evaluation of the ILSG classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A cohort of 1,403 cases of NHL was organized at nine study sites around the world and consisted of consecutive patients seen between 1988 and 1990 who were previously untreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A detailed protocol for histologic and clinical analysis was followed at each site, and immunologic characterization as to T- or B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> was required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five expert hematopathologists visited the sites and each classified each case using the ILSG classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A consensus diagnosis was also reached in each case, and each expert rereviewed a 20% random sample of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical correlations and survival analyses were then performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of NHL was confirmed in 1,378 (98.2%) of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> types were diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (31%) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (22%), whereas the new entities comprised 21% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic accuracy was at least 85% for most of the major <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> types, and reproducibility of the diagnosis was 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotyping improved the diagnostic accuracy by 10% to 45% for a number of the major types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The clinical features of the new entities were distinctive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Both the histologic types and the patient characteristics as defined by the International Prognostic Index predicted for patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion we found that the ILSG classification can be readily applied and identifies clinically distinctive types of NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, for clinical application, prognostic factors as defined by the International Prognostic Index must be combined with the histologic diagnosis for appropriate clinical decisions </plain></SENT>
