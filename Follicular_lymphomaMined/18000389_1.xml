<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the detection rate largely varied with the technique used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the incidence of IGH rearrangements using several fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques on metaphases obtained from 96 patients with nodal NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An IGH rearrangement was identified in 71 cases (74%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A t(14;18)(q32;q21) was found in 37 of the 42 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (88.1%) studied and a t(11;14)(q13;q32) in 12 of the 14 mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (85.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IGH rearrangements were identified in 21 of the 40 diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (52.5%), including seven t(14;18)(q32;q21) and four t(3;14)(q27;q32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conventional cytogenetics was uninformative in several cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the complemented analysis using 24-color FISH, chromosomal whole paints, telomeric probes and locus specific identifiers enabled us to characterize complex and/or masked IGH translocations in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the chromosomal partners involved in IGH rearrangements in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study shows the interest of using metaphase FISH in addition to conventional cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following banding techniques, FISH with the IGH dual color probe can be the first approach in NHL, after which chromosome painting and 24-color FISH can be used to identify the chromosomal partners involved in IGH rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The identification of these genes is of utmost importance for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the genesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
