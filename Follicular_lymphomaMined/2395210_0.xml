<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This prompts us to study <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) which is undetectable by conventional morphological or cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using this technique, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specific chimeric DNA or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were detected in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with t(14; 18) or in Ph1 positive ALL in complete remission, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PCR was also useful to monitor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> after treatment of bone marrow cells with monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In sex-mismatched bone marrow transplantation, mixed chimerism was well documented by using repeated sequences which is unique to human Y chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that PCR offers a great help for detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> or mixed-chimerism following bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
