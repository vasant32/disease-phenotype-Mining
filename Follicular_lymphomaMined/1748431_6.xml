<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One hundred fifty-two cases (155 specimens) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> were studied by immunohistochemistry and gene rearrangement analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ninety-five of 96 B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (99%) showed genotypic B-cell monoclonality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, five cases had rearranged T-cell receptor (TCR) beta chain gene in addition to immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) and kappa light chain (Ig-K), one case had rearranged IgH and TCR-gamma chain but not Ig-K or TCR-beta, and two cases had only Ig-K rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One exceptional case in the B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> group had unrearranged, germline genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only 10 of 19 (53%) phenotypic T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had rearranged TCR-beta, eight with concurrent TCR-gamma rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining nine cases, six had germline configuration, two had rearranged Ig-K only, and one had both IgH and Ig-K rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This last case was reclassified as T-cell predominant, B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of 16 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> had germline configuration; three cases had rearranged IgH and Ig-K, of which two were lymphocyte predominant with light chain monoclonality and one was a recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 21 reactive lesions, 17 had germline configuration and four had rearranged IgH and Ig-K genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these four cases, two were orbital lesions, one was a partially involved lymph node, and one developed a nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 9 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> have IgH and/or Ig-K rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> have greater genotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, and germline patterns for TCR genes are not uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Reactive lesions and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> tend to retain germline configuration, and any exception is often associated with an unusual clinical setting and/or histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Genotypic analysis is thus most indicated in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with equivocal immunohistochemistry findings, T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and atypical cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and reactive lesions </plain></SENT>
