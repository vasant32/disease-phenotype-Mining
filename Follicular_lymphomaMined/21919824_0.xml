<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report describes two cases of lymph nodal in situ FL complicated by the association with nonlymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In case 1, in situ FL was discovered incidentally on a biopsy performed for an unexplained cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> 6 months after the resection of a carotid body <z:hpo ids='HP_0002668'>paraganglioma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In case 2, in situ FL was detected incidentally during surgery for radical resection of prostatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the lymph nodes, the in situ FL foci were characterized immunohistologically by strong coexpression of BCL2 and CD10 in the involved GCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FISH study demonstrated BCL2 rearrangement in one of the two tested cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data extend the spectrum of the clinical situations that may be associated with in situ FL, but the biological and clinical significance of the association of in situ FL with nonlymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> deserves further investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="?"><plain>Important fields of investigation should include: (1) how to approach these patients who have a risk of progression to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; (2) is the association of in situ FL with concurrent nonlymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> incidental, related to immunosuppression or to previous treatment </plain></SENT>
