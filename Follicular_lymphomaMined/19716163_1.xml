<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to characterize growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 protein expression in reactive tonsillar tissues and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissues obtained from diagnostic biopsies of classical Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, primary mediastinal large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 20 low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 expression was assessed in tissues by immunohistochemistry and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines by immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In reactive lymphoid tissues, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 was expressed in the cytoplasm of B-cells and histiocytes but not T-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Strong, cytoplasmic growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 expression was seen in the neoplastic cells of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, primary mediastinal large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only 10% of the classical Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 expression in the neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 protein expression was detected by Western blotting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines tested with higher levels in primary mediastinal large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> compared with classical Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
