<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cytologic evaluation of lymph node fine-needle aspirates and serous effusions is a rapid and useful means for establishing the diagnosis of a variety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in some instances, cytologic findings are not sufficient to establish a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, thus necessitating the use of ancillary procedures, the most frequent of which is immunophenotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this respect, the usefulness of molecular markers, such as clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements or chromosomal translocations, have been less well evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> constitutes an interesting disease for such a study because these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> possess characteristic histopathologic features and contain two potential molecular markers, that is, a clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and a bcl-2 gene translocation [t(14;18)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we evaluated, retrospectively, the cytologic material from four lymph node fine-needle aspirates and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo> of five patients with biopsy-proven follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In four of the cases, definitive diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had not been possible solely from cytologic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA was isolated from archival air-dried samples present on glass slides and amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of either a clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement or bcl-2 translocation (major breakpoint region) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement was detected in four of five patients, and two patients had the bcl-2 translocation by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effusion case was identical by gel electrophoresis with product amplified from a lymph node biopsy of the same patient and DNA extracted directly from fresh <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo> cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
