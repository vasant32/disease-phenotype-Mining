<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additional genetic mutations are required to generate a fully malignant phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Secondary chromosomal alterations seen in FL include prominent involvement of chromosome 1 in the form of balanced or unbalanced translocations, insertions, deletions, and duplications involving both the p and q arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated a diagnostically well defined set of 55 t(14;18)-positive FL cases with complex karyotypes by means of multicolor karyotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen cases showed involvement of chromosome 1 and were analyzed in further detail by a novel multicolor banding technique for this chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We defined three groups showing varying complexity of chromosome 1 alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first group revealed simple translocations, such as t(1;2), t(1;6), t(1;8), and t(1;17), involving breakpoints on either the p or the q arm of chromosome 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The second group showed more complex rearrangements with translocations, insertions, regional duplications, and involvement of more than one partner chromosome with either the p or the q arm of chromosome 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The third group was defined by highly complex rearrangements involving translocations, regional duplications, amplifications, and intrachromosomal band relocations affecting the entire chromosome 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three groups shared interchromosomal rearrangements of chromosome 1 with chromosome 8, often involving the MYC protooncogene site, amplification involving region 1q21-q31, and deletion involving region 1p36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the use of sophisticated multicolor molecular cytogenetic assays in the investigation of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> allows precise characterization of chromosomal alterations and will provide a better understanding of their biology </plain></SENT>
