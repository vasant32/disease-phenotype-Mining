<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the reactive lymphoid tissues, the anti-Sld antibodies each reacted with a subpopulation of cells in the mantle zone and interfollicular areas; they rarely reacted with cells in the germinal center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 13 anti-Sld antibodies reacted with a total of 78 of 186 (42%) specimens bearing immunoglobulin; none of the antibodies reacted with 41 specimens not bearing immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (15/19, 79%) and extranodal small lymphocytic/non-mantle cell diffuse small cleaved <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (11/15, 73%), the reactivity of the antibodies was high compared with that in the other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (52/152, 34%; P = 0.0002 and 0.004, respectively), including follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (11/42, 27%; P = 0.002 and 0.002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since idiotypes are associated with the hypervariable regions and antigen-binding sites of immunoglobulin, these findings may reflect the differences in the regions/sites in each of these diseases </plain></SENT>
