<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The genes affected by these rearrangements remain poorly characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Typically, 1q21-23 rearrangements arise during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> evolution and accompany disease-specific chromosomal rearrangements such as t(14;18) (BCL2) and t(8;14) (MYC), where they are thus thought to play an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pathogenetic basis of this 1q21-23-associated disease progression is currently unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this setting, we surveyed our series of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> for evidence of recurring 1q21-23 breaks and identified three cases in which a t(14;18)(q32;q21) was accompanied by a novel balanced t(1;22)(q22;q11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecular cloning of the t(1;22) in a cell line (B593) derived from one of these cases and detailed fluorescent in situ hybridization mapping in the two remaining cases identified the FCGR2B gene, which encodes the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif-bearing IgG Fc receptor, FcgammaRIIB, as the target gene of the t(1;22)(q22;q11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate deregulation of FCGR2B leading to hyperexpression of FcgammaRIIb2 as the principal consequence of the t(1;22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is evidence that IgG Fc receptors can be targets for deregulation through chromosomal translocation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It suggests that dysregulation of FCGR2B may play a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
