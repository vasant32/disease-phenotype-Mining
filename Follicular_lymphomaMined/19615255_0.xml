<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility of semi-nested PCR technique for detection of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) clonal rearrangement in bone marrow of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patient and to further evaluate its clinicopathological value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Gene clonal rearrangement of IgH was detected by semi-nested PCR using primers of FR2 &amp; FR3A in 105 bone marrow samples of patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The PCR detection results were compared with the cytomorphology of bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlation between PCR detection results and clinicopathological factors were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 105 cases of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, bone marrow involvement was detected by PCR technique in 48 cases (45.7%), while only 22 cases (21.0%) were detected by bone marrow cytological analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference between two methods (P &lt; 0.05), and the concordance rate was 71.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of bone marrow involvement at the time of initial diagnosis detected by PCR technique was 30.8% for diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), 25.0% for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), and 100.0% for small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow involvement detected by PCR detection correlated with Ann Arbor stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rate of clonal IgH gene rearrangement by PCR in early B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was lower than that in advanced stage B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in efficacy between patients with positive and negative results detected by PCR (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>But difference in complete response (CR) rate (23.3% and 46.3%) had significant difference (P = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Semi-nested PCR analysis may be an effective method for detection of abnormalities in bone marrow in patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and is superior to cytomorphology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The positive rate in patients with advanced Ann Arbor stage is higher than that in patients with early Ann Arbor stage, and patients with PCR negative result have more chances to achieved CR after treatment </plain></SENT>
