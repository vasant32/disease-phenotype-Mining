<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report the outcome of 73 patients with lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> who received RISCT with a fludarabine/cyclophosphosphamide conditioning regimen and a median follow-up of 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median age was 54 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight per cent of patients had previously undergone autologous stem cell transplantation with a median of three prior therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Non-relapse mortality at 3 years was 19% but only 5% for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three-year overall survival and current progression-free survival was 67% and 63% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grade 2-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD occurred in 14% of patients while 49% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD requiring systemic immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The preparatory regimen in this study has the advantage of reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD and low mortality, notably in patients with MM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, this strategy provides long-term disease control in a significant proportion of patients with particular benefit in those with high-risk follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
