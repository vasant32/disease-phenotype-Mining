<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More recently, bendamustine has demonstrated activity in refractory FL, and has been explored as initial therapy and in novel combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whereas outcomes for this patient population have significantly improved, there remains substantial unmet need for patients who require more effective and better-tolerated therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Novel anti-CD20 antibodies and other immunotherapies against different B-cell antigens are under active investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proteosome inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> and the immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide have demonstrated single-agent activity and are currently in randomized trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other novel compounds have demonstrated activity in broad-based clinical studies in B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, considerable challenges remain in efficiently demonstrating which patient subsets can benefit from these novel compounds and which combinations may have the greatest clinical benefit in further improving outcomes for patients with FL </plain></SENT>
