<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the trade-off of toxicity versus improved clinical outcome with interferon alfa-2b (IFN) administered concomitantly with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-containing regimen for the treatment of advanced follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A quality-of-life-adjusted survival analysis (Quality-Adjusted Time Without Symptoms or Toxicity [Q-TWiST]) was applied to the <z:chebi fb="98" ids="24433">Groupe</z:chebi> d'Etude des Lymphomes Folliculaires (GELF) trial 86, which compared a regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, teniposide, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHVP) versus CHVP plus IFN in 242 patients with confirmed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CHVP was administered monthly for 6 months then every other month for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The IFN dosage was 5 x 10(6) U three times weekly for 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median follow-up duration of 72 months, the IFN group gained a mean of 12.3 months of progression-free survival (PFS) and 7.4 months of overall survival (OS), but also experienced additional time with grade 3 or worse toxicity compared with the CHVP group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that CHVP plus IFN provided a greater amount of quality-adjusted survival regardless of the relative quality-of-life valuations placed on time with toxicity due to CVHP alone, time with toxicity due to CHVP plus IFN, and time following disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This gain was significant (P &lt; .05) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases except for patients who consider time with toxicity to have a low relative value and time following disease progression to have a high relative value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with advanced follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the clinical benefits of concomitant IFN can significantly offset the associated grade 3 or worse toxic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of this clinical benefit depends on an individual patient's relative quality-of-life valuations for time with toxicity and time following disease progression </plain></SENT>
