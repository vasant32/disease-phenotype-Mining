<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate patient-specific immunotherapy with mitumprotimut-T (idiotype keyhole limpet hemocyanin [Id-KLH]) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in CD20(+) follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with treatment-naive or relapsed/refractory disease achieving a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) with four weekly rituximab infusions were randomly assigned to mitumprotimut-T/GM-CSF or placebo/GM-CSF, with doses given monthly for six doses, every 2 months for six doses, and then every 3 months until disease progression (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Randomization was stratified by prior therapy (treatment-naive or relapsed/refractory) and response to rituximab (CR/PR or SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was time to progression (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) from randomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 349 patients were randomly assigned; median age was 54 years, 79% were treatment naive, and 86% had stage III/IV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> was 9.0 months for mitumprotimut-T/GM-CSF and 12.6 months for placebo/GM-CSF (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.384; P = .019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> was comparable between the two arms in treatment-naive patients (HR = 1.196; P = .258) and shorter with mitumprotimut-T/GM-CSF in relapsed/refractory disease (HR = 2.265; P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) scores, the difference in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> between the two arms was no longer significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall objective response rate, rate of response improvement, and duration of response were comparable between the two arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was similar in the two arms; 76% of adverse events were mild or moderate, and 94% of patients had injection site reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> was shorter with mitumprotimut-T/GM-CSF compared with placebo/GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This difference was possibly due to the imbalance in FLIPI scores </plain></SENT>
