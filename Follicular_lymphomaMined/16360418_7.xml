<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mononuclear phagocyte system of human lymphoid tissue comprises macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the non-DC mononuclear phagocyte population in human lymphoid tissue has been little addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we studied the expression of 2 monocyte-derived markers, CD14 and CD169 (sialoadhesin), in reactive human lymphoid tissue as well as in a series of 51 B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> by immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We confirmed that lymph node sinusoidal monocyte-derived cells were the only population staining for CD169 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although most sinusoidal histiocytes also expressed CD14, monocyte-derived cells with phagocytosis such as erythrophagocytosis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003165" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anthracosis</z:e>, or tingible bodies macrophage lacked CD14 and CD169 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was the only one associated with an expansion of the CD14(+)CD169(+) cells in the cords </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With respect to nodal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, CD14(+) cells were rare among B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, strikingly, we found a strong expansion of CD14(+)CD169(-) cells in numerous diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e>), except in cases associated with numerous mitoses, apoptotic bodies, and tingible bodies macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When cultivated in granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor/interleukin 4, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> purified CD14(+) cells differentiate into plasmacytoid cells, expressing DC-specific intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin, suggesting dendritic cell differentiation potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our observation fits well with the lymph node and host response cluster signatures described in the gene profiling signatures of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the role of this CD14(+) population that may constitute a microenvironment-related marker of this subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
