<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis was performed using the 10K GeneChip array on a series of 26 paired follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) and transformed-FL (t-FL) biopsies and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines SCI-1, DoHH2 and RL2261 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regions of acquired homozygosity were detected in 43/52 (83%) primary specimens with a mean of 1.7 and 3.0 aberrations in the FL and t-FL, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A notable feature was the occurrence of recurring sites of acquired <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (aUDP) on 6p, 9p, 12q and 17p in cell lines and primary samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Homozygosity of 9p and 17p arose predominantly in t-FL and in three cases rendered the cell homozygous for a pre-existing mutation of either CDKN2A or TP53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that mutation precedes mitotic recombination, which leads to the removal of the remaining <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 18 cases exhibited abnormalities in both FL and t-FL samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 10 cases blocks of homozygosity were detected in FL that were absent in the subsequent t-FL sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These differences support the notion that FL and t-FL may arise in a proportion of patients by divergence from a common malignant ancestor cell rather than by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> from an antecedent FL </plain></SENT>
