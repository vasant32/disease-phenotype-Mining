<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many biomedical studies focus on delaying disease relapses and on prolonging survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Usual methods only consider one event, often the first recurrence or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, ignoring the other recurrences may lead to biased results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The whole history of the disease should be considered for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, some diseases involve recurrences that can increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this case, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> time may be dependent on the recurrent event history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose a joint frailty model to analyze recurrences and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two gamma-distributed frailties take into account both the inter-recurrences dependence and the dependence between the recurrences and the survival times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We estimate separate parameters for disease recurrent event times and survival times in the joint frailty model to distinguish treatment effects and prognostic factors on these two types of events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We show how maximum penalized likelihood estimation can be applied to semiparametric estimation of the continuous hazard functions in the proposed joint frailty model with right censoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also propose parametrical approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We evaluate the model by simulation studies and illustrate through a study of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
