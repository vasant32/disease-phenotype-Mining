<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, most studies were retrospective, and few distinguished former drinkers or infrequent drinkers from consistent nondrinkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the authors investigated whether history of alcohol drinking affected risks of NHL and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> among 102,721 eligible women in the California Teachers Study, a prospective cohort study in which 496 women were diagnosed with B-cell NHL and 101 were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> between 1995-1996 and December 31, 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of B-cell NHL combined or <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> was not associated with self-reported past consumption of alcohol, beer, wine, or liquor at ages 18-22 years, at ages 30-35 years, or during the year before baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NHL subtypes were inconsistently associated with alcohol intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, women who were former alcohol drinkers at baseline were at elevated risk of overall B-cell NHL (rate ratio = 1.46, 95% confidence interval: 1.08, 1.97) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (rate ratio = 1.81, 95% confidence interval: 1.00, 3.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The higher risk among former drinkers emphasizes the importance of classifying both current and past alcohol consumption and suggests that factors related to quitting drinking, rather than alcohol itself, may increase B-cell NHL risk </plain></SENT>
