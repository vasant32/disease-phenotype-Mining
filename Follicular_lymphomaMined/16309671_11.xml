<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (Dex) induced depolarization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane, release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> and DNA fragmentation in a human follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, HF28RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>New protein synthesis was required before Dex-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> changes, and the kinetics of the apoptotic events correlated with the upregulation of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we studied whether specific inhibitors of known survival pathways would potentiate Dex-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results show that inhibition of PKC and ERK pathways had no effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, inhibition of PI3-kinase or Akt markedly enhanced Dex-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The enhancement was seen at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> level, and the kinetics of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was notably accelerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, inhibition of PI3-kinase did not alter levels of Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L) or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> proteins in mitochondria but caused translocation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bad to mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, inhibition of PI3-kinase-Akt pathway and subsequent translocation of Bad to mitochondria did not induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on these results and our current understanding of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> and Bad action, it seems that both proteins play a synergistic role in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, these results indicate that inhibitors of PI3-kinase-Akt pathway might be combined in future with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> to improve the treatment of lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
