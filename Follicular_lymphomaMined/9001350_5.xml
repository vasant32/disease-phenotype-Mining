<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed histopathological specimens from 118 of 135 patients who had been diagnosed as having follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> between 1968 and 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prognostic factors influencing survival were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Factors that were independently significant upon multivariate analysis were incorporated into a predictive model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety-three patients (78.8%) had a confirmed diagnosis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one of the remaining 25 patients were categorized as having other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes, and four patients showed indefinite findings or those suggesting diseases other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Major characteristics of the 93 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were a median age of 53 years (20-85); 59 males (63%) and 34 females (37%); small cleaved cell type in 33 (35%), mixed cell type in 41 (44%) and large cell type in 19 (20%); stage I/II in 41 (44%) and stage III/IV in 50 (54%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was 71% at 5 years, 58% at 10 years, and 43% at 15 years with a median survival of 13.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that two variables, age (&gt;60) (P=0.001) and the serum LDH level (&gt;1 x <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value) (P=0.026), were unfavorably significant prognostic factors influencing survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The predictive model using these two variables identified three risk groups with estimated five-year survival rates of 88.5%, 56.8%, and 31.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age and serum LDH were significant predictors of survival in Japanese patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our predictive model may provide a basis for future therapeutic trials against follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Japan </plain></SENT>
