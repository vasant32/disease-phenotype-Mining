<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A phase II study of Prednimustine (PMN) was conducted for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PMN at a dose of 40-60 mg/body, p.o. every day, was administered to 17 patients with FL and 4 with CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dose and schedule of PMN was modified according to hematological toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 17 patients with FL, there were 6 (35.3%) CRs and 7 (41.2%) PRs, with a high response rate of 76.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 4 patients with CLL, there were 2 PRs and one case which showed clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PMN was effective for cases of FL and CLL refractory to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi>, and therefore the result suggested a lack of clinical cross-resistance to these agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As to the side effects observed in patients with FL, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> (median of lowest count 3,150/mm3) occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One case experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo>, while increased appetite was observed in 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that PMN is effective for FL and CLL, and that in addition, it has an advantage in that its mild side effects allow long-term administration through outpatient clinics, so that the quality of life for patients is not impaired </plain></SENT>
