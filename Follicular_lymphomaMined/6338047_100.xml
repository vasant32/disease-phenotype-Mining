<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A murine monoclonal antibody (designated R4/23) which reacts strongly with human dendritic reticulum cells (DRC) is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunoperoxidase staining of tissue cryostat sections revealed that this antibody reacts strongly with DRC in lymphoid follicles (both primary and secondary), and also weakly with marginal zone splenic B cells and with some peripheral follicular mantle B lymphocytes in lymph node cortical follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The value of antibody R4/23 is that it allows the distribution of DRC in reactive and neoplastic lymphoid tissue to be clearly delineated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of particular interest is the fact that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of germinal centre cell origin are consistently accompanied by a proliferation of DRC, even when the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> is present in non-lymphoid tissue--for example, in the kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, DRC in B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of non-germinal centre origin are partially or totally obliterated </plain></SENT>
