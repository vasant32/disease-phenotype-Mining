<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The breakpoints cluster mainly in a region spanning the first noncoding exon of the gene (the major breakpoint region) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A second breakpoint cluster has also been identified upstream of the first BCL6 noncoding exon (the alternative breakpoint region [ABR]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To date, eight different rearrangements involving the ABR have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe a novel rearrangement involving a t(2;3)(p11;q27) translocation that affects the ABR in an unusual combination with the IGK locus </plain></SENT>
