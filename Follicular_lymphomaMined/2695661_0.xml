<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A frequency of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was 9.3% in the 364 patients with nodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> registered between 1981-1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients (42%) were classified as follicular medium-sized cell type (F-medium; identical with follicular small cleaved cell type by Working Formulation criteria), 12 (24%) as follicular mixed (F-mixed), and 17 (34%) as follicular large (F-large) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 31 (62%) patients with Stage III-IV disease involving bone marrow in 6 patients, liver in 2, bone marrow and liver in 2, stomach in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall five- and ten-year survival rates were 65% and 32%, respectively, in the 49 patients whose median follow-up period was 3 years, ranging from 2 to 11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adriamycin-based combination chemotherapy [ADM(+) therapy] produced 10 (100%) complete response (CR) of 10 patients with F-large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 8 (80%) of them were free from relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>But, in the patients with F-medium <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, ADM(+) therapy produced one (17%) CR of 6 patients and their survivals were not superior to those treated with ADM(-) therapy, single agents or radiotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the natural history or therapeutic results between the patients in Japan and United States, although the frequency of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was extremely lower in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ADM(+) therapy can be accepted as the first-line chemotherapy for the patients with F-large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but the best modality of treatment should be investigated for the patients with F-medium <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
