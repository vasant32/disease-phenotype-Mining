<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 6 patients (age range, 56-72 years; mean, 62.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We searched the database of our institution and retrospectively collected data on the thyroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that were confirmed pathologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the sonograms and medical records were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 6 patients had an enlarged neck mass and underwent ultrasound-guided fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most notable sonographic feature of primary thyroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was a marked hypoechoic mass compared with the residual thyroid tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 6 patients with a diagnosis of thyroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 3 (50%) had a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> by ultrasound-guided fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Final pathologic results were obtained by ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy (3/6 patients [50%]) or thyroidectomy (3/6 [50%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most patients with thyroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (5/6 [83.3%]) were found to have diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and were treated with chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, diagnosis and treatment were accomplished by total thyroidectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy can be a safe and accurate method for diagnosing thyroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and may be a suitable replacement for diagnostic thyroid surgery </plain></SENT>
