<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Special interest has been devoted to late toxicities and outcome in terms of molecular status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ninety-two untreated FL patients aged &lt;or=60 were enrolled by 20 Italian centers and evaluated on an intention-to-treat basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Main findings are as follows: (1) 5.5-years overall survival projection of 80% (median follow-up: 68 months), with no differences related to age-adjusted IPI score; (2) 46 (50%) of 92 patients presently in continuous complete remission; (3) projected long-term progression-free survival exceeding 80% for patients collecting PCR-negative stem cell harvests or achieving molecular remission within the first 2 years from the end of therapy; (4) actuarial 5-years risk of developing secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> of 3.7%, with most of these events occurring in patients re-treated for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that i-HDS is feasible, effective and safe even in terms of long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As the HDS schedule can be easily supplemented with Rituximab, it is one of the best options for random comparison with Rituximab-supplemented conventional chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
