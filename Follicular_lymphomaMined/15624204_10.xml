<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: CD19 is expressed on most B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; however, the frequency and types of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with low-level expression of CD19 are not well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed flow cytometric histograms specifically for decreased CD19 expression on 349 cases analyzed by the Flow Cytometry Laboratory at University Hospitals of Cleveland (Cleveland, Ohio) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results of flow cytometry were correlated with the morphologic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the cases reviewed, 125 (36%) showed a visible decrease in CD19 expression compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Decreased CD19 expression was noted in 79% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (27 of 34), 36% of small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo> (82 of 228), 31% of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (4 of 13), 24% of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (8 of 33), and 13% of marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>/lymphoplasmacytoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (4 of 30) and was not observed in any Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (0 of 5) or hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (0 of 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Decreased CD19 expression was significantly more frequent in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> than in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed in the frequency of decreased CD19 expression based on histologic grade of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Diminished expression of CD19 expression occurs frequently in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, in particular follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and may be helpful in identifying B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in complex cell mixtures such as bone marrow specimens </plain></SENT>
