<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 confers a longer half-life to the cell, which overexpresses it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As the translocation t(14,18), which is most often found in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and leads to overexpression of bcl-2, has also been reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>, it is possible that there is a correlation between these events in this entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We stained immunohistochemically 40 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> for the presence of bcl-2 and EBV-LMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 positivity within reactive lymphocytes was revealed in 29 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In five of these cases a week, positive reaction in cytoplasm of Reed-Sternberg cells was observed (one mixed cellularity and four nodular <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The EBV-LMP immunopositivity was observed in 16 of these 29 cases (ten MC and six NS cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The simultaneous presence of bcl-2 protein and EBV-LMP was found in two cases, the remaining three bcl-2-positive cases did not have EBV-LMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results do not support the hypothesis of the correlation between the expression of bcl-2 protein and the presence of EBV-LMP in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> as the LMP-dependent stimulation of bcl-2 oncogene </plain></SENT>
