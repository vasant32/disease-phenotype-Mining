<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the association of these factors with risk of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) overall and for diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> specifically in a prospective cohort of 35,159 Iowa women aged 55-69 years when enrolled at baseline in 1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diet was ascertained using a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Through 2005, 415 cases of NHL (including 184 DLBCL and 90 follicular) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox regression, adjusting for age and total energy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The strongest associations of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> with risk of NHL (RR for highest versus lowest quartile; p for trend) were observed for dietary <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> (RR = 0.78; p = 0.044), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28425">alpha-carotene</z:chebi> (RR = 0.71; p = 0.015), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26267">proanthocyanidins</z:chebi> (RR = 0.70; p = 0.0024) and dietary <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> (RR = 0.62; p = 0.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no associations with multivitamin use or supplemental intake of <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamins C</z:chebi>, E, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi>, zinc, copper or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From a food perspective, greater intake of total fruits and vegetables (RR = 0.69; p = 0.011), yellow/orange (RR = 0.72; p = 0.015) and cruciferous (RR = 0.82; p = 0.017) vegetables, broccoli (RR = 0.72; p = 0.018) and apple juice/cider (RR = 0.65; p = 0.026) were associated with lower NHL risk; there were no strong associations for other <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>-rich foods, including whole grains, chocolate, tea or nuts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, these associations were mainly observed for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and were weaker or not apparent for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these results support a role for vegetables, and perhaps fruits and associated <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> from food sources, as protective factors against the development of NHL and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in particular </plain></SENT>
