<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results show (1) that the four <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> types present a characteristic range of enzyme activity in an increasing order: B-CLL, BC/CC, IC, and PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>B lymphocytes, germinal center cells, and plasmacytes are the main constituents of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This sequence might reflect one possible mode of B-cell transformation into plasmacytes traversing an amplification stage in germinal centers under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases showed the basic IEF pattern of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B lymphocytes with 12 bands localized in three regions between pH 6.1 and 3.9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This finding supports the B-cell origin and the close phenotypical relationship among the investigated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(3) The IEF patterns of B-CLL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1511945" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CB/CC</z:e> did not differ from that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B lymphocytes, whereas two additional isoenzymes were encountered in cases of IC and seven in PC; this suggests that the higher enzyme activity of IC and PC is at least partly due to the appearance of "new" isoenzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results support the validity of the underlying classification and indicate the individually, B-cell origin, and close relationship among the four <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> entities investigated </plain></SENT>
