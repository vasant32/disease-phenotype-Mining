<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) in peripheral blood (PB) and/or bone marrow (BM) samples collected pre- and post transplant from 23 recipient-donor pairs receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 23 donors, 11 had a PB and/or BM sample positive for t(14;18) (BCL2/IGH fusion) at low levels (&lt;one t(14;18) cell in 10K total cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recipients from donors with (n=11) and those without (n=12) detectable t(14:18) cells were similar in age, sex, and disease status pretransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No differences in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host-disease</z:e> (GVHD), delayed engraftment, relapse rate, disease-free survival and overall survival were identified between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two recipients without detectable t(14;18) cells pre-transplant showed detectable t(14;18) cells at 2 and 11 years after receiving grafts from donors with t(14:18) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither patient developed FL 1.5 and 2 years after the emergence of t(14;18) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the sample size is relatively small, our findings suggest that individuals carrying t(14;18) cells may not be excluded as donors given the lack of an association of t(14;18) detected in donors with adverse clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It may be necessary to screen for the donor's t(14;18) status before using t(14;18) for monitoring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> by RQ-PCR to exclude the possibility of confounding donor's t(14;18) clone </plain></SENT>
