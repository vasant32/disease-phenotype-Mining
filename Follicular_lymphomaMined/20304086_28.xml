<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Immunotherapeutic ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is a conceptually attractive treatment strategy that is the subject of intense translational research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that are genetically modified to express CD19- or CD20-specific, single-chain antibody-derived chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) display HLA-independent antigen-specific recognition/killing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe our initial experience in applying CAR-redirected autologous CTL adoptive therapy to patients with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using plasmid vector electrotransfer/drug selection systems, cloned and polyclonal CAR(+) CTLs were generated from autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells and expanded in vitro to cell numbers sufficient for clinical use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 2 FDA-authorized trials, patients with recurrent diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were treated with cloned CD8(+) CTLs expressing a CD20-specific CAR (along with NeoR) after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and patients with refractory follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were treated with polyclonal T cell preparations expressing a CD19-specific CAR (along with HyTK, a fusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24753">hygromycin</z:chebi> resistance and HSV-1 thymidine kinase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0812393,C0038661" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">suicide</z:e> genes) and low-dose s.c. recombinant human interleukin-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 15 infusions were administered (5 at 10(8)cells/m(2), 7 at 10(9)cells/m(2), and 3 at 2 x 10(9)cells/m(2)) to 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overt toxicities attributable to CTL administration were not observed; however, detection of transferred CTLs in the circulation, as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, was short (24 hours to 7 days), and cellular antitransgene immune rejection responses were noted in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies reveal the primary barrier to therapeutic efficacy is limited persistence, and provide the rationale to prospectively define T cell populations intrinsically programmed for survival after adoptive transfer and to modulate the immune status of recipients to prevent/delay antitransgene rejection responses </plain></SENT>
