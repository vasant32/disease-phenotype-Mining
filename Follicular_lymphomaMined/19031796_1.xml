<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen cases of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011953'>pulmonary lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosed from Jan 1989 to Feb 2007 were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 6 males and 12 females, with a median age of 47.5 years (17-71 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen cases were diagnosed by surgical lung biopsy; 1 by percutaneous needle lung biopsy (1/6), 1 by percutaneous needle lung biopsy and bronchoscopic examination at the same time, the other 1 by bronchoscopic examination (1/10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological diagnosis showed that 2 cases were Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 9 mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 1 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 2 diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 2 anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 2 non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> whichcould not be classified because the slides were from other hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common symptoms were cough (9/18) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (6/18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ESR elevation was common (10/12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CT features included solitary or multiple nodules (14/18), patchy opacities (11/18), consolidations (5/18), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusions</z:hpo> (5/18), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100750'>atelectasis</z:hpo> (5/18), and cavities (1/18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Misdiagnosis was found in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment modalities included surgical resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up time was 11 months (10 d to 205 mon) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients were still alive, 4 patients were lost, and 1 patient died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The prognosis was associated with the level of [25.1 x 10(9)/L(18.1 - 39 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>-1) x 10(9)/L in poor prognosis group, 6.7 x 10(9)/L (5.48 - 8.41) x 10(9)/L in good prognosis group, u = 0.000, P &lt;0.05] <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> (3/3 vs 1/10, P &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clinical manifestations of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011953'>pulmonary lymphoma</z:hpo> are nonspecific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Misdiagnosis is common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Surgical lung biopsy is necessary for early diagnosis </plain></SENT>
