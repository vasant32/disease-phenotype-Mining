<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) and B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) occasionally occur in the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such composite <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> represent interesting models to study the pathogenesis of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and the relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> and B-cell NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed two composite <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (a combination of classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> [FL] and a combination of classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> [B-CLL]) by micromanipulation of single cells from tissue sections and amplification of immunoglobulin V region genes for the clonal relationship of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both cases, clonally related variable (V) genes with both shared as well as distinct <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> were obtained from the two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, showing that in each of the cases the distinct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were members of a common germinal center (GC) B-cell clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FL cells from two different lymph nodes of patient 1 showed a similar mutation pattern, suggesting that infiltration of these lymph nodes by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells was not restricted to a particular FL cell or subclone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the FL, a single cell was identified with a mutation signature indicating that premalignant cells can persist in the tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The cases presented here further underline the close relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> and B-cell NHL and the role of the GC in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas the latter was already suggested for FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>, the present study indicates that also in the B-CLL subset characterized by mutated Ig genes, important steps in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> happen in the GC, and that HRS cells can derive from CD5-positive B cells </plain></SENT>
