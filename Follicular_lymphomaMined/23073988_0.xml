<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Secondary changes have yet only been described in few of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we performed array-comparative genomic hybridization and molecular inversion probe microarray analyses on DNA from 12 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded and two fresh-frozen IRF4 translocation-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, which together with the previously published data on nine cases allowed the extension of copy number analyses to a total of 23 of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> except one case carried chromosomal imbalances, most frequently gains in Xq28, 11q22.3-qter, and 7q32.1-qter and losses in 6q13-16.1, 15q14-22.31, and 17p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No recurrent copy-neutral losses of heterozygosity were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TP53 point mutations were detected in three of six cases with loss of 17p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall this study unravels a recurrent pattern of secondary genetic alterations in IRF4 translocation-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
