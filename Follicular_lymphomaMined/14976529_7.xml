<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Promoter hypermethylation resulting in inactivation of the p16 gene has been found in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancies</z:e>, including non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and may play a role in transformation/clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> of those <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the p16 protein expression in primary gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has not been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we characterize protein expression and promoter hypermethylation of the p16 gene in B-cell primary gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> from China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 43 cases of B-cell primary gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They consisted of 24 (56%) cases of diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 12 (28%) cases of extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, six (14%) cases of extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with large-cell transformation and one (2%) case of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Loss of p16 protein expression was found in 34 (79%) out of 43 cases, while the remaining nine (21%) cases showed positivities for the p16 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 43 cases were further characterized by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to analyze p16 promoter hypermethylation status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In total, 11 (26%) of 43 cases were positive for p16 promoter hypermethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among those, 10 (30%) out of the 33 cases negative for the p16 immunostaining showed promoter hypermethylation, whereas only one (10%) out of the 10 cases that were positive for the p16 immunostaining displayed promoter hypermethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 43 cases, 30 had limited pathologic data at the time of resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Primary gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involved extragastric sites (lymph node or liver) in 17 (57%) of 30 cases, while the remaining 13 (43%) cases were only limited to the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Loss of p16 protein expression was found in 14 (82%) of 17 cases with extragastric involvement and in 11 (85%) of 13 cases without such involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, loss of p16 protein expression is frequent in those B-cell primary gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and approximately one-third of such loss correlated with promoter hypermethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Despite limited pathologic data, loss of p16 protein expression appears not to be correlated with extragastric involvements </plain></SENT>
