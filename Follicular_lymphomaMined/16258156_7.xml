<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The detection of clonality in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was recently improved by the BIOMED-2 approach, but analysis of fixed tissues is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we adapted the BIOMED-2 protocol for examining immunoglobulin H (IgH) receptor rearrangements in fixed, decalcified bone marrow biopsies (BMBs) for clonality analysis in B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (B-NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study included 111 decalcified BMBs (12 formalin fixed and 99 glutardialdehyde fixed), with B-NHL (n = 85), T-NHL (n = 8), or reactive infiltrates (n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initially, IgH FRIII polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of crude DNA extracts from 75 glutardialdehyde-fixed BMBs (B-NHLs) using a standard seminested PCR resulted in clonal peaks in 46 of 75 (61.3%) BMBs compared with 19 of 70 (27.1%) for the original BIOMED-2 protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Modifications to both DNA extraction and PCR reaction improved the detection rate to 26 of 36 (72.2%) for BIOMED-2 primers, including 10 of 15 (66.7%) cases not detected by our standard IgH analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, introducing the same modifications for analysis of the FRII region by BIOMED-2 primers revealed clonal peaks in 19 of 36 (52.8%) B-NHLs compared with 5 of 70 (7.1%) for the original BIOMED-2 protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together, analysis of FRII and FRIII regions by the modified BIOMED-2 protocol increased the detection rate to 31 of 36 (86.1%), particularly for BMBs with histological evidence of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FRIII, 70%; FRII, 90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, this study provides an improved protocol for detection of clonality by IgH-specific BIOMED-2 primers in fixed, decalcified bone marrow biopsies </plain></SENT>
