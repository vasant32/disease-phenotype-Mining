<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously reported cases of histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> after follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> suggested that follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> can transdifferentiate into histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe another case involving a 40-year old male who developed histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> in his right thigh 4 years after the diagnosis of grade 1 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the left neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were morphologically and immunophenotypically different but had identical immunoglobulin heavy chain gene and bcl-2 gene rearrangements, as demonstrated by polymerase chain gene reaction analysis, and the presence of t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation was confirmed via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because of spindle cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and focal S-100 positivity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100697'>malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> diagnoses were made initially and extensive workup was required to discover the correct diagnosis </plain></SENT>
