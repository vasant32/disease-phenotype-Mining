<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, post-BMT patients may develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> (AIHA), which sometimes fails to respond to standard therapies </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rituximab is currently only labeled for treatment of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, such as B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; however, it is also employed in the treatment of a variety of disorders mediated by auto-antibodies, such as AIHA and transplant-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
