<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied 48 non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> (FNA) specimens with initial cytomorphology (CM) and flow cytometry (FC) and subsequent surgical biopsy of the same lesion to determine whether a reliable diagnosis of large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or large cell transformation could be made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CM was evaluated by examining 200 lymphocytes in each specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FC was performed by analyzing monoclonal or abnormal B-cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Percentages of large cells were evaluated by CM and FC and results correlated with the histologic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> small cell NHLs showed fewer than 40% large cells by CM and FC; 100% (9/9; FC) and 67% (6/9; CM) of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> demonstrated greater than 40% large cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Variable numbers of large cells were detected in grade III follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with partial large cell transformation, and large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> containing fewer than 10% neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By using combined CM and FC, large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and large cell transformation can be diagnosed reliably by FNA if greater than 40% large cells are present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical biopsy is necessary when there is <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, fewer than 10% neoplastic cells by FC, or fewer than 40% large cells with clinical signs of transformation </plain></SENT>
