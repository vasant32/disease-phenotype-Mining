<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-two CD34+ cell selections from patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 14), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 6), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 1), and splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 1) were performed by use of a magnetic cell selector followed by a negative cell selection step with anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody bound to immunomagnetic beads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The PBPC components contained median CD34+ cells of 1.24 percent (range, 0.38-3.92%) and CD19+ cells of 1.83 percent (range, 0.06-69.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After positive selection (n = 22), 49 percent (range, 16-72%) of CD34+ cells were recovered with a purity of 93 percent (range, 24-99%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The double-positive and -negative selections (n = 20) yielded 57.5 percent of CD34+ cells (range, 33.4-79.4%) with a purity of 95 percent (range, 63-99%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logarithms of B-cell reduction in the CD34+-cell-enriched B-cell-depleted component had a median value of 3.63 (range, 2.74-4.84 log) and CD19+ and CD5+ cells for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> patients with more than 4.56 log (&gt;3.6-5.6 log) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 13 PBPC components that had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific clonal signal, 10 became PCR negative after the double-selection procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Combined positive and negative magnetic cell selection achieves a high grade of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell reduction with up to 77 percent of the grafts being negative for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific clonal signal by PCR analysis </plain></SENT>
