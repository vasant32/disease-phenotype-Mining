<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the cellular origin of this entity is unclear and its ultrastructure has not been described before, we processed formalin-fixed samples for electron microscopy, which revealed three cell types: small lymphocytes with cleaved nuclei, large lymphocytes with vesticular noncleaved nuclei, and mesenchymal stromal cells occasionally bearing desmosomes or hemidesmosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was an increase of the intercellular connective tissue, which consisted of a mixture of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and fibrous long spacing collagen fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> can evolve from a nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and that diagnostic information can be obtained by electron microscopy of tissue samples previously fixed in formalin </plain></SENT>
