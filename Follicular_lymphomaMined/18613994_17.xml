<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the effectiveness of peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FCIP) in predicting the histologic B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied the FCIP results and tissue histopathology from 252 patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> seen at Mayo Clinic's site in Rochester, MN, between January 1, 1997, and January 1, 2004, who had positive results on PB, bone marrow, or body fluid FCIP and a corresponding diagnostic tissue biopsy specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most of the B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> studied were low grade, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL)/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> being most common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric immunophenotyping histogram analysis was more informative than tabulated percentage antigen positivity; surface immunoglobulin and CD20 staining intensity, CD5 and CD23 positivity, CD10 positivity, and the coexpression of CD11c/CD22 and CD103 were the most pertinent markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using these FCIP parameters and strict immunophenotypic definitions for CLL, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>), and hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, we obtained greater than 95% specificity for each diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, we encountered the following exceptions to standard paradigms of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-associated FCIP: (1) CD5 expression by disorders distinct from CLL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, (2) lack of uniform CD5 positivity in some CLL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> cases, (3) absence of CD10 in approximately 50% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and (4) expression of CD103 by occasional marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Stringent interpretation of PB and bone marrow FCIP results enables identification of certain B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the observed exceptions to accepted immunophenotypic paradigms highlight the occasional phenotypic overlap among diseases and emphasize that a systematic approach to FCIP interpretations is key to providing clinically useful diagnostic information </plain></SENT>
