<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BCL-2 is an antiapoptotic protein overexpressed in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, principally as a result of the t(14;18)(q32;q21), and useful in distinguishing follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (usually BCL-2 positive) from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> (BCL-2 negative) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BCL-2 is also overexpressed in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> types without the t(14;18), including marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, because of other, poorly understood mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that BCL-2 immunoreactivity can distinguish between malignant (BCL-2 positive) and reactive (BCL-2 negative) marginal zone B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated 26 spleen, 10 abdominal lymph node, and 3 ileum specimens with marginal zone B-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> for BCL-2 expression immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed these cases using polymerase chain reaction methods to evaluate for the presence of clonal rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH) using consensus V FRIII and J region primers, and the t(14;18) involving both the major breakpoint and the minor cluster regions of the bcl-2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> (100%) cases of splenic, abdominal lymph node, and ileal marginal zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> displayed strong BCL-2 reactivity in the marginal zone B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases analyzed, IgH polymerase chain reaction demonstrated a polyclonal pattern, and bcl-2/JH DNA fusion sequences were not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that BCL-2 is consistently expressed by reactive marginal zone B cells of the spleen, abdominal lymph nodes, and ileal lymphoid tissue and should not be used as a criterion for discriminating between benign and malignant marginal zone B-cell proliferations involving these sites </plain></SENT>
