<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A subset of cases harbours translocations involving the BCL6-gene locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine the frequency of BCL2- and BCL6-translocations in FL and to identify morphological and immuno-histochemical features with respect to the presence of BCL2- and BCL6-translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fluorescence-in-situ-hybridisation (FISH) was used to determine the BCL2- and BCL6-translocation status of 102 FL and these were compared to morphological and immunohistochemical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphomas</z:hpo> with BCL6- and BCL2-translocations were very similar to t(14;18)-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> without BCL6-translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, t(14;18)-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with BCL6-translocations were amongst others of higher grade, less often CD10-positive, involved the bone marrow less frequently and did not infiltrate the lymph node capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BCL2- and BCL6-translocations correlate with particular phenotypes of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BCL6-translocations seem to affect the phenotype only when they are not accompanied by BCL2-translocations </plain></SENT>
