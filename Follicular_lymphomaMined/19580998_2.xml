<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD19+ and CD20+ B cell counts in peripheral blood decreased rapidly following Rituximab treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six months after the end of treatment, a few CD19+ B cells were detected in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cells had a naive B <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> (IgD+, CD27-) and they expressed high levels of CD38 and CD24, which show that the B cell pool was repopulated mainly with immature, naive B cells </plain></SENT>
