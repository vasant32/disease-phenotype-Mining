<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is recent inconclusive evidence that, in such cases, intensification or salvage treatment with high-dose chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) increases the response rate and may improve survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, published data on long-term follow-up of high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients treated with HSCT are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 101 consecutive patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy followed by HSCT after induction with standard chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age was 38 years (range, 12-63 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (n = 32), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 33), diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 12), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 7), T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 14), and others (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients received either an autologous graft (n = 72) in first complete remission (1CR; n = 23) or in advanced stages (AS; n = 49), or an allogeneic graft (n = 29) in 1CR (n = 7) or in AS (n = 22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We concluded that transplant-related mortality was 2.7% for patients receiving an autologous HSCT and 27% for patients receiving an allogeneic HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The main etiologies were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in the allogeneic setting, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in the autologous setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The probability of long-term (12-year) overall survival was 71%, higher than that described for high-relapse-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients treated without HSCT and significantly better (P &lt; .05) for patients who received the transplant in 1CR (89%) than in AS (65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, the probability of long-term survival was significantly better for patients treated with HSCT during the period from 2000-2007 (85%) compared with the period from 1989-1999 (72%) </plain></SENT>
