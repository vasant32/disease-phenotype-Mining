<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have compared the value of immunohistochemical and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques in distinguishing follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of 41 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 15 reactive lymph nodes and 5 reactive tonsils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry demonstrated bcl-2 protein in the follicle centre cells of 97% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> whereas monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain was detected in 83% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Assessing the lowest proliferating follicle of each case by MIB-1 immunostaining, proliferation fractions in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> varied from 0.5% to 59% (mean 15.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over 80% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had proliferation fractions of less than 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PCR detected gene rearrangement either at the bcl-2 locus, or at the IgH locus, or at both loci in 32%, 44% and 61% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The follicle centre cells of the reactive lymph nodes and tonsils were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> bcl-2 protein negative and polytypic for kappa and lambda light chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proliferation fractions of the lowest proliferating follicle in each reactive case ranged from 30.5% to 86.8% (mean 64.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rearrangements of the bcl-2 or IgH loci were not detected in any reactive case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that bcl-2 and light chain immunostaining are the most consistently helpful <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> to diagnosing follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A low proliferation fraction also indicates <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but a high proliferation fraction does not exclude the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining with a combination of anti bcl-2 and MIB 1 antibodies is a sensitive and specific method for identifying follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, is technically simple to perform and easy to interpret </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In occasional cases, where immunostaining gives equivocal results, PCR analysis can confirm <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but a negative result does not exclude the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
