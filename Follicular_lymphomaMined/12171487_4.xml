<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detection of this translocation in a clinical sample suspected of containing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> can assist the pathologist in diagnosis and classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction is a technology that is frequently used to detect the t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation (bcl-2/J(H)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This article reviews the utility of polymerase chain reaction testing for bcl-2/J(H) detection and summarizes the experience of participants in the Molecular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Proficiency Survey of the College of American Pathologists from 1997 through 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe current practice and encourage improvement of bcl-2/J(H) testing in clinical laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of Molecular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Proficiency Survey data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Laboratory participants in the College of American Pathology Molecular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Proficiency Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four well-characterized specimens were sent to participants, of which 6 contained bcl-2/J(H) major breakpoint region translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight hundred nineteen major breakpoint region and 323 minor cluster region determinations were performed, with an overall correct response rate of 91% and 94%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in correct response could be found for frozen versus paraffin-embedded tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Many laboratories did not know their assay sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Overall performance was good; however, there was great variability in the methods reported and lack of knowledge of the limits of detection was common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Continued participation in external quality control programs, such as the Molecular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Survey; dissemination of information that impacts on test performance; and technical recommendations from the molecular diagnostics community are critical for improved testing for bcl-2/J(H) </plain></SENT>
