<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The International Network of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Treatment and Research (INCTR) recently organized a workshop on non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHLs) in selected developing countries with the purpose of examining existing information relating to the pathology and management of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, and identifying potential areas for research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report provides a summary of the information presented and is focused primarily on the pathology of NHLs in children and adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In most countries, the WHO classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was used and most participating centers included immunohistochemistry using a wide array of lymphoid antibodies as part of routine diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some of the series had been reviewed by an external panel of experts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> accounted for 82-88% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphatic leukemia</z:hpo> (4-6%), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, 3-5%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> (2-4%) were similar in the series presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there was a significant variation in the proportion of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), which accounted for 15% and 11% in India and Kuwait, but less than 5% in Pakistan and Egypt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these frequencies are significantly lower than those reported in Western series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> accounted for about 35% of cases in India but for more 50% in other countries, but this difference was not accounted for by an increased incidence in a single <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtype in India, but rather an apparent paucity of several subtypes (such as mantle cell and marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>)) in other series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were relatively high frequencies of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Egypt (7%) and precursor T-cell lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in India (6-7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCLs</z:e>) (not otherwise specified and angioimmunoblastic subtypes) accounted for 3-5% of NHLs, and extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of T/NK cell type was rare (&lt;1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These differences in the relative proportions of NHL subtypes among developing countries and between developing countries and the rest of the world presumably arise from differences in environmental and genetic factors that influence <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> and strongly suggest that more research in developing countries would provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
