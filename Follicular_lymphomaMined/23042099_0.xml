<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16285">Phytanic acid</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26607">saturated fatty acid</z:chebi> obtained primarily through the consumption of ruminant meat and dairy products, may offer a potential underlying mechanism for these associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a population-based case-control study of 336 cases and 460 controls conducted in Nebraska during 1999-2002, we examined whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16285">phytanic acid</z:chebi>-containing foods or total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16285">phytanic acid</z:chebi> intake, estimated from a food frequency questionnaire and the published <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16285">phytanic acid</z:chebi> values of 151 food items, were associated with increased NHL risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for overall NHL and the common NHL histologic subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariable models, higher intakes of density-adjusted beef [OR(T3 vs. T1) = 1.5 (1.1-2.2); P(trend) = 0.02], total dairy products [OR = 1.5 (1.1-2.2); P(trend) = 0.02) and milk [OR = 1.6 (1.1-2.3); P(trend) = 0.01] were associated with an increased risk of NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intake of total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16285">phytanic acid</z:chebi> was positively associated with NHL risk [OR = 1.5 (1.0-2.1); P(trend) = 0.04] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In analyses stratified by NHL subtype, greater consumption of beef was associated with an increased risk of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and greater consumption of milk was associated with an increased risk of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16285">phytanic acid</z:chebi> intake was associated with an increased risk of FL and small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results provide support that total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16285">phytanic acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16285">phytanic acid</z:chebi>-containing foods may increase NHL risk </plain></SENT>
