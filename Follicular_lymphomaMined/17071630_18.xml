<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated five single nucleotide polymorphisms in four key caspase genes, CASP3 [Ex8-280C&gt;A (rs6948) and Ex8+567T&gt;C (rs1049216)], CASP8 Ex14-271A&gt;T (rs13113), CASP9 Ex5+32G&gt;A (rs1052576) and CASP10 Ex3-171A&gt;G (rs3900115) to determine whether they alter risk for non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) in a population-based case-control study of women in Connecticut (461 cases and 535 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Variants in CASP3 and CASP9 were significantly associated with a decreased risk for NHL, particularly follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> [e.g. CASP3 Ex8+567T&gt;C odds ratio (OR)(CC+TC) = 0.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.3-0.7; and CASP9 Ex5+32G&gt;A OR(AA+AG) = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.4-1.0] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further, variants in CASP3, CASP8 and CASP10 were associated with a decreased risk of marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and variants in CASP3 and CASP10 were associated with a lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and related subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The striking protective associations observed for polymorphisms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four genes for NHL and/or one or more subtypes suggest that genetic variation in CASP genes may play an important role in the etiology of NHL </plain></SENT>
