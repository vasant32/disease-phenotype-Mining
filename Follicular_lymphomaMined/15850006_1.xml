<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS AND BACKGROUND: In order to increase the prognostic significance of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) data it has been suggested that quantitative PCR can be used to measure <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this option has not yet been definitely supported or refuted in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We decided to evaluate whether knowledge of the quantitative level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> and its variations can be of use in the management of FL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used qualitative and competitive PCR to study 11 patients with refractory or relapsed FL harboring the t(14;18) translocation who underwent autologous (nine patients) or allogeneic (two patients) stem cell transplantation (SCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Competitive PCR was performed with a multiple competitor carrying specific sequences including Bcl2/IgH MBR and mcr, and the beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median post-SCT follow-up of 44 months (range, 12-62), overall survival was 91% and disease-free survival 82% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The quantitative PCR data showed that: 1) effective chemotherapy before SCT substantially (1-2 log) reduced the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden in the bone marrow (BM); 2) the increase in rearranged DNA detected in BM was associated with disease progression and relapse; 3) a PCR-negative autograft seemed to lead to lasting molecular remission even when it was performed in patients with a low level of BM infiltration before transplant; and 4) allo-SCT made and maintained the BM PCR negative even in the presence of a greater <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden before SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six of the nine patients having CR after SCT (four auto and two allo) are in continuous molecular remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In FL patients qualitative and quantitative PCR may provide data that can be helpful for the prognostic evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> and the early detection of impending relapse by highlighting biological features such as the quality of the infused material, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden at transplant, and the behavior of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells after transplant </plain></SENT>
