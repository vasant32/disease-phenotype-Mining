<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We undertook a single center retrospective cohort study to investigate the efficacy of retreatment with rituximab with or without chemotherapy in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We only included patients treated first-line and in first progression; 178 patients were included in the study, of whom 29% had diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and 28% had follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate for the first treatment was 81% and for the second treatment was 66% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median progression-free survival (PFS) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients from diagnosis was 13.2 months and from relapse was 12.5 months (not statistically different) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> the median PFS from diagnosis was 9.6 months and from relapse was 8.4 months, and for FL the median PFS from diagnosis was 26.4 months and from relapse was 19.2 months (not statistically different) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall survival was 57% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a historical comparison with rituximab-naive patients, rituximab-retreated patients had a shorter time to initial relapse than control patients, but there was no difference between the two groups for PFS from relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, retreatment with rituximab, with or without chemotherapy, yields a high overall response rate in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Relapse occurring after rituximab-containing therapy appears to be more aggressive than that occurring after chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The outcome of retreatment, in terms of progression-free survival, is similar to that of primary treatment </plain></SENT>
