<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) involvement in FL was investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a series of 24 consecutive patients with histologically revised diagnosis and treated with involved field radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the limited stage, Bcl-2/IgH+ cells were found at diagnosis in PB and/or BM of 16 patients (66.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After treatment, in 9/15 Bcl-2/IgH positive evaluable patients, a disappearance of Bcl-2/IgH+ cells was observed, which persisted after a median follow-up of 43.5 months (range 11-70) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative PCR demonstrated the feasibility of clearing PB and BM Bcl-2+ cells after local irradiation of the primary site of the disease only when the basal number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells was &lt;1:100 000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with Bcl-2/IgH+ cells at diagnosis or after treatment had a higher likelihood of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, despite a negative BM biopsy, the majority of localised FL Bcl-2/IgH+ cells were found in the PB and BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> cells can reversibly spread from the affected lymph node to PB and BM and, in a proportion of cases, durably disappear after irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The possibility of a persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell clearance is proportional to the amount of cells detected at presentation by quantitative PCR </plain></SENT>
