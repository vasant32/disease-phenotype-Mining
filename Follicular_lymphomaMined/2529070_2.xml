<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The tissues examined in this study included lymph nodes, extranodal tissues of divergent diseases, and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the germinal centers (GCs) of the lymph follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FceRII showed a lace-like pattern irrespective of the distribution of IgE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In general, FceRII was positive only in the light zone and not in the dark zone of GCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distribution of FceRII was different from that of DRC1(+) <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> which were FceRII(+) and FceRII(-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FceRII was seen by immunoelectron microscopy on the cell surface of follicular dendritic cells (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IgE-positive GCs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033838" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Kimura's disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001429" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Warthin's tumor</z:e> were intensely positive for FceRII in their entire portion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In IgE-positive GCs, an increased number of FceRII-positive lymphoid GC cells was recognized by immunoelectron microscopic observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, there were also two types of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> which were FceRII(+) and FceRII(-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings indicated that FceRII on <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> was closely related to the IgE immune response and also was a marker for functional phase or differentiation of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
