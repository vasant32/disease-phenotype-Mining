<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-Two cases of intestinal NHL were studied clinically and pathologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were reclassified according to the WHO classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-one cases (65.6%) were diagnosed as B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including 15 cases of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 2 cases of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 1 case of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 2 cases of MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 1 case of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten cases (31.2%) were diagnosed as T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002242'>enteropathy</z:hpo>-associated T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (EATCL) and 8 cases non-EATCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One case (3.1%) was diagnosed as histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine cases were at stage I-II and 23 cases were at stage III-IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up information was available in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases ranging from 4 to 168 months (mean 25.6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifteen cases died of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mortality rates were 33% for B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 80% for T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on Cox multivariate analysis, the clinical stage and histological types of the disease were important prognostic factors (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had a relatively poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is the most common subtype of primary intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Colon is the most common site involved, followed by the small intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Early stage of the disease and low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> appear to have a better prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has a very poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
