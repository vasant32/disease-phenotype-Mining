<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To analyze the characterization of T-cell receptor-gamma (TCR-gamma) gene rearrangement in the gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and evaluate the value of PCR-SSCP analysis in gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TCR-gamma gene rearrangement segments of gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were cloned and sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Single clone plasmid and mixed clone plasmids were subsequently submitted to PCR-SSCP analysis to investigate the relationship between the number of amplified clones and band patterns of the amplified products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The PCR products of TCR-gamma gene rearrangement of 40 gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were electrophoresed on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gels and the positive cases on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gels were studied by SSCP analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sequencing showed that TCR-gamma gene rearrangement of the gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> included functional gene and pseudogene with extensive variety in the junctional regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In SSCP analysis, the number of the single-stranded bands was about two times of the number of amplified clones, and double-stranded band became broad with the increased number of the amplified clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of the 25 B-cell gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 14 of the 15 gastrointestinal T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were positive detected on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the positive cases detected by SSCP analysis, 3 B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 13 T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed positive bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other cases showed only smears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rearranged pattern included 13 monoallelic gene rearrangements and 3 biallelic or oligoclonal gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The pattern of TCR-gamma gene rearrangement in gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are similar to that of the nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PCR-SSCP analysis for TCR-gamma gene rearrangement can be applied both for adjuvant diagnosis of gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and analysis of the gene rearrangement pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The ratio of TCR-gamma gene rearrangements occurred in T-cell gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is significantly higher than that in B-cell gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The gene rearrangement pattern involves monoallelic and biallelic (or oligoclonal) gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
