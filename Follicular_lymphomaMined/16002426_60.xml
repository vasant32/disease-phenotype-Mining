<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We conducted a phase 1/2 trial of high-dose 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan in combination with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi>) 40 to 60 mg/kg (day -4) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 100 mg/kg (day -2) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in 31 patients with CD20+ non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent dosimetry (day -21) with 5 mCi (185 MBq) 111In-ibritumomab tiuxetan following 250 mg/m2 rituximab, followed a week later by 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan to deliver a target dose of 1000 cGy to highest <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> organ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow biopsy was done on day -7 to estimate radiation dose and stem cells were reinfused when the radiation dose was estimated to be less than 5 cGy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan dose was 71.6 mCi (2649.2 MBq; range, 36.6-105 mCi; range, 1354.2-3885 MBq) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histology included follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 12), diffuse large B-cell (n = 14), and mantle cell (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median number of prior chemo-therapy treatments was 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The treatment was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median times to reach an absolute neutrophil count greater than 500/microL and platelet count more than 20,000/microL were 10 days and 12 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and 5 relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 22 months, the 2-year estimated overall survival and relapse-free survival rates are 92% and 78%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that high-dose 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan can be combined safely with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> without an increase in transplant-related toxicity or delayed engraftment </plain></SENT>
