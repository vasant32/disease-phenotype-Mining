<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> constituted 7.7% (94/1208) of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients were diagnosed with stage I follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 20 with stage II, 23 with stage III, and 33 with stage IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were subclassified as: follicular small cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FSC) in 20 cases, follicular mixed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FMX) in 59 cases, and follicular large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FLC) in 15 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients comprised 49 men and 45 women with a median age of 54 years (range, 25-84 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The complete response rate was 76.5%, and the median survival time was 13 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expected 10-year overall survival and event-free survival rates were 61.9% and 38.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis identified the factors associated with poor survival as elevated serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) level (P &lt; .0001), age of &gt;60 (P &lt; .0001), Ann Arbor stage III/IV (P &lt; .01), and Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group performance status (PS) of 2 to 4 (P = .048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that LDH, age, and PS were independent predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After application of the International Prognostic Index (IPI), the 10-year survival rates for the low-risk, low-intermediate risk, high-intermediate risk and high-risk groups were 80.4%, 48.7%, 21.9%, and 0.0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The differences among these groups were significant at P &lt; .01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The IPI for aggressive non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was found to be applicable to survival prediction for Japanese follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
