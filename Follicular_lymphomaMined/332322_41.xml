<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five percent of the patients have been followed for at least 5 years after initial therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of actuarial survival curves reveals that patients in the poorly differentiated lymphocytic and mixed histiocytic-lymphocytic categories with the three architectural patterns ("nodular only," "nodular with focal diffuse," and "nodular with diffuse") have similar long-term and disease-free survivals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, any degree of nodularity imparts a more favorable prognosis than diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of coreresponding cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the small number of patients with a nodular lye than in the other two histiocytic type, associated with diffuse areas, the prognosis is less favorable than in the other two histologic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, a nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of so-called histiocytic type with diffuse areas may behave more like a diffuse than nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and warrants appropriate therapy </plain></SENT>
