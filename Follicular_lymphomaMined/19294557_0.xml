<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Differential diagnosis of the subtypes is sometimes difficult, especially for small B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (SBCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Standardisation of molecular genetic assays using multiple gene expression analysis by microarrays could be a useful complement to the current diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to develop a low density DNA microarray for the analysis of 107 genes associated with B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and to evaluate its performance in the diagnosis of SBCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A predictive tool based on Fisher discriminant analysis using a training set of 40 patients including four different subtypes (follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> n = 15, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> n = 7, B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> n = 6 and splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> n = 12) was designed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A short additional preliminary analysis to gauge the accuracy of this signature was then performed on an external set of nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using this model, eight of nine of those samples were classified successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This pilot study demonstrates that such a microarray tool may be a promising diagnostic approach for small B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
