<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because diagnosis was difficult relying only on formalin-fixed histopathology, we examined the cell surface markers and karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient, a 65-year-old man, presented with multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011134'>low-grade fever</z:hpo>, night sweats, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo>, dry cough and sense of chest oppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell surface marker analysis showed that pathologic lymphocytes were positive for CD 10, CD 19, CD 20, HLA-DR, IgM/IgD and kappa, and t (14; 18) (q 32; q 21) was detected by karyotypic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 'reverse' variant of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, clinical stage <z:mp ids='MP_0010560'>IVB</z:mp> was diagnosed the rearrangement band was detected with PCR-based clonality analysis in not only the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene but also the T cell receptor gamma chain gene, thus confirming monoclonal proliferation of both B cells and T cells </plain></SENT>
