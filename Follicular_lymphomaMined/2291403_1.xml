<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To study changes in the clinico-pathological features of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in Japan, the histopathological and clinical features of 71 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and 49 cases of nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> occurring in Nagoya were compared in three different periods (1965-71, 1972-78 and 1979-85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proportional frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> among total <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (10%) and that of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> among non-Hodgkin's nodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (18%) did not vary over the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As to the histological patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, the relative frequency of the nodular <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (NS) type, which is relatively common in young women, increased, but that of other types decreased in the more recent periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the relative frequency of the completely follicular type, which is more common in the United States than in Japan, increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The five-year survival rate in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> improved more recently even after adjusting for the effects of other prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This recent increase in survival rates may be due partly to the recent improvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment, but is also related to the recent increase in patients with better prognostic features, i.e. the NS type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These variations over time suggest that the patterns of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in Japan might be gradually changing, probably because of westernization, as seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> of other organs </plain></SENT>
