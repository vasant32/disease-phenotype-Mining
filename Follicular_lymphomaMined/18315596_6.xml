<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to present a series of cases with persistent lymph node enlargement that featured some germinal centres showing light chain immunoglobulin restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A series of six reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002840'>lymphadenitis</z:hpo> and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017531" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GLNH|AFLH">Castleman's disease</z:e> cases was analysed by immunohistochemistry, IgH-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and microdissected PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases some germinal centres contained a population of plasma cells and plasmacytoid germinal centre cells showing light chain immunoglobulin restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In three cases the monotypic cells also showed distinct Bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of the cases showed a predominant IgH rearrangement on a florid polyclonal background and one had an IgH monoclonal rearrangement, as revealed by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microdissected germinal centre PCR revealed a dominant repeated band in one of three cases and in another case a non-repeated clonal peak was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of the patients developed a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which became evident from a subsequent biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings may be a manifestation of an underlying disorder in the regulation of the immune response, or an exaggeration of the germinal centre oligoclonal nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
