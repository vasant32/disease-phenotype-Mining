<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite its known involvement in a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), a detailed examination of BSAP expression in NHL has not been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant lymphoid tissues and cell lines, including 102 cases of B-cell NHL, 23 cases of T- and null-cell NHL, and 18 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> lymphoid tissues showed strong nuclear BSAP expression in mantle zone B cells, less intense reactivity in follicular center B cells, and no expression in cells of the T-cell-rich zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monocytoid B cells showed weak expression, whereas plasma cells and extrafollicular large transformed B cells were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 102 B-cell NHLs, 83 (81%) demonstrated BSAP expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 13 (100%) B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo> (B-CLLs), 21 of (100%) mantle cells (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCLs</z:e>), and 20 of 21 (95%) follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs) were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moderate staining intensities were found in most B-CLL and FL cases, whereas most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCLs</z:e> showed strong reactions, paralleling the strong reactivity of nonmalignant mantle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight of 12 (67%) marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases showed negative or low BSAP levels, and 17 of 24 (71%) large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> displayed moderate to strong expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the 23 T- and null-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> reacted with the BSAP antisera, whereas in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, 2 of 4 (50%) nodular lymphocytic predominance and 5 of 14 (36%) classical cases showed weak nuclear or nucleolar BSAP reactions in a fraction of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis showed a 52-kD BSAP band in B-cell lines, but not in non-B-cell or plasma cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that BSAP expression is largely restricted to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of B-cell lineage and that BSAP expression varies in B-cell subsets and subtypes of B-cell NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The high levels of BSAP, especially those found in large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and in some follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, may be a consequence of deregulated gene expression and suggest a possible involvement of PAX-5 in certain B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
