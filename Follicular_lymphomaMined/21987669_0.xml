<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases of lacrimal gland <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from January 1, 1975, through December 31, 2009, were retrieved from The Danish Registry of Pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histologic specimens were reevaluated using a panel of monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical files from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients with lacrimal gland <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight of the patients were men and 19 were women; the median (range) age was 69 (43-87) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes was as follows: extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 10 (37%); follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 5 (19%); diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 4 (15%); mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 3 (11%); <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 2 (7%); and unclassified B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 3 (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients (81%) had stage I or II <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 1 patient (4%) had stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 4 patients (15%) had stage IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with stage I or II <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were treated with radiotherapy (15 [67%]), chemotherapy (3 [14%]), chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (1 [5%]), and surgery (3 [14%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients presenting with stage III or IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were treated with chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complete remission was observed in 23 of the patients (85%), although 12 (44%) of these had a relapse, independent of subtype, stage, or treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall survival was 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the lacrimal gland is relatively rare and is mostly prevalent in elderly women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The distribution of lacrimal gland <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes resembles that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes of the salivary glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The majority of lacrimal gland <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are low grade, and the prognosis is relatively good </plain></SENT>
