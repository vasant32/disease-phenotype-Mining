<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about additional chromosomal aberrations in Asian FL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We applied comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to screen for genomic imbalances in 32 biopsy samples from 23 Japanese patients with nodal FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18) was assessed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers for the major (MBR), 3'MBR, minor (mcr), 5'mcr, and intermediate breakpoint cluster regions (icr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 17 of 23 patients, CGH analyses detected genomic imbalances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gains frequently affected chromosomes 18p (6 of 23), X (5 of 23), 5 (4 of 23), 12 (4 of 23), 2 (3 of 23), and 16 (3 of 23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The only recurrent loss affected chromosome 6q (2 of 23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A t(14;18) was detected in 13 of 23 patients (56.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Breakpoints were located in the MBR (10 patients), in the 3'MBR, in the mcr, and in the icr (1 patient each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of aberrations detected by CGH as well as relapse-free survival were not distinctly different between patients with and without a t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, no significant difference in the overall frequency of aberrations compared with Westerners was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite the extended primer set used, the frequency of PCR-detected t(14;18) remained low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additional studies are required to assess the reasons for geographic variation in FL </plain></SENT>
