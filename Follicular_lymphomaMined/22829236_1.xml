<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> depends on CD4+ cells, but CD8+ cells counteract it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the presence of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is associated with higher CD4+ than CD8+ cell numbers in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> microenvironment but not in the immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using flow cytometry, pre-treatment and follow-up CD4/CD8 ratios were estimated in the bone marrow, blood and lymph nodes of untreated follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients in two independent data sets (N(1)=121; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17997">N(2)</z:chebi>=166) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ratios were analyzed for their relation with bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone marrows were also investigated with immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In either data set, the bone marrow CD4/CD8 ratios were higher in bone marrows involved with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (P=0.043 and 0.0002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean CD4/CD8 ratio was 1.0 in uninvolved and 1.4 in involved bone marrows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also higher in involved bone marrows were CD4/CD56 and CD3CD25/CD3 ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No blood or lymph node ratios differed between bone marrow-negative and -positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sequential samples showed increased bone marrow CD4/CD8 ratios in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of progression to bone marrow involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry showed CD4+, CD57+, programmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-1+, forkhead box protein 3+ and CD21+ cells accumulated inside the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> infiltrates, whereas CD8+, CD56+ and CD68+ cells were outside the infiltrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study provides evidence in vivo that the microenvironment changes upon follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involvement </plain></SENT>
