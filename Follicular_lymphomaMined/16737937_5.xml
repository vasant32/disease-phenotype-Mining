<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether follicular histology in large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> influences treatment outcomes after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It remains an area of controversy whether the natural history of follicular large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FLCL) is akin to diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL) with curative potential or is more similar to indolent follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with a pattern of late relapses after intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although ASCT is a potentially curative treatment for patients with recurrent DLCL, the effectiveness of this approach in patients with FLCL is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We undertook a retrospective analysis of 332 patients with large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who underwent ASCT at the City of Hope Comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 31 months, the projected 10-year overall survival and disease-free survival were similar between patients with FLCL and DLCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of prognostic factors demonstrated that although age, chemotherapy refractoriness, and disease status at the time of ASCT were predictive of overall survival/disease-free survival, follicularity did not influence the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the similar plateau in the survival curve for the DLCL and FLCL patients suggests that the behavior of FLCL is similar to that of DLCL and that FLCL is potentially curable with ASCT </plain></SENT>
