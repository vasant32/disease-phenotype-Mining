<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The potential of Bcl-2 for the differential diagnosis of follicular lesions was emphasized, and the results on follicular lesions were correlated with those of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In hyperplastic lymphoid tissue, Bcl-2 reactivity was widespread, including germinal center surroundings, scattered cells within the germinal centers, and the T-cell areas in general </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Distinctively negative lymphoid populations included the majority of germinal center cells, and the negative staining pattern was maintained in cases of florid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were consistently Bcl-2 positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemical Bcl-2 reactivity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> follicles correlated with the clonal PCR amplification pattern of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Bcl-2-negative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasias</z:mpath> revealed a non-clonal pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clusters of monocytoid B cells were Bcl-2 negative, whereas monocytoid B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and closely related MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other small cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of B-cell types showed nearly uniform Bcl-2 reactivity, whereas large cell B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were variably positive (74%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Hodgkin's cells, Bcl-2 reactivity was seen in the neoplastic populations of most cases of nodular <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> and mixed cellularity types, whereas the L&amp;H and Reed-Sternberg cells in lymphocyte predominance <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> were negative in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 immunohistochemistry thus appears very valuable in the differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, and it may help to distinguish between reactive and neoplastic monocytoid B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, Bcl-2 immunohistochemistry is not useful in the subtyping of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
