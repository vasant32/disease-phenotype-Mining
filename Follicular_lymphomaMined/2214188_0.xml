<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of the bcl-2 gene was studied in seven cultured cell lines and twenty clinical samples, including eleven non-<z:mp ids='MP_0002022'>lymphoid tumors</z:mp> and nine <z:mp ids='MP_0002022'>lymphoid tumors</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002022'>lymphoid tumors</z:mp> except one sample from a patient with ALL expressed the bcl-2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2 gene was strongly expressed in B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This gene was also expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> samples studied, although the expression was not as marked as in the B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non-<z:mp ids='MP_0002022'>lymphoid tumors</z:mp> did not express bcl-2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>bcl-2 gene rearrangement was studied in five cultured cell lines and six clinical samples including four follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No abnormal bcl-2 gene configurations were found in any of the clinical samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the cultured cell lines, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">BALL</z:e>-1 line showed two-fold amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of bcl-2 rearrangement in Japanese follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is reported to be lower than that seen in the American follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the increased expression of the bcl-2 gene seen in the Japanese B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> studied supports the contention that the bcl-2 gene plays an important role in the pathogenesis of B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
