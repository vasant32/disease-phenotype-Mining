<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>When the latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome in B95-8 cells is induced into a replicative phase, two abundant early <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> are transcribed rightward from the EBV BamHI H DNA fragment into BamHI F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis of cDNA clones prepared from the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> of cells replicating EBV revealed that both <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> contain the BHRF1 open reading frame </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Part of BHRF1, cloned into a prokaryotic fusion protein expression vector, expressed a fusion protein in Escherichia coli and the purified fusion protein was used to generate a monoclonal antibody against BHRF1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This antibody was then employed to characterize the protein encoded by BHRF1 in cells replicating EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The monoclonal antibody reacted with a 17-kDa protein component of the restricted early antigen (EA) complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the protein in cells was similar to that noted when sera from patients with African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were used to stain these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The protein was synthesized before the major 47-56 kDa protein associated with the diffuse component of EA in superinfected Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> human sera containing antibodies to EA as determined by immunofluorescence (IF) reacted with the protein as did some sera determined to be anti-VCA positive and anti-EA negative by IF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The predicted amino acid sequence of the protein has characteristics which suggest that it is a membrane protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It also has significant homology with both the anchor region of polyoma middle T antigen and with the predicted protein product of the bcl-2 mRNA activated by the 14/18 chromosome translocation characteristic of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This latter homology is extensive and colinear, suggesting common evolution and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, neither a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> which could efficiently translate the BHRF1 protein nor the BHRF1 protein could be detected in latently infected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, the bcl-2 predicted protein is similar to an EBV protein synthesized in the early phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
