<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to well-known premalignant B-cell proliferations, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278494" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MGUS">monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MGUS</z:e>) and monoclonal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo> (MBL), so-called in situ <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> have recently been described with minimal infiltrates of clonal B-cells in morphologically reactive lymphoid tissues which show the phenotypic and genetic features of specific B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes and often show a characteristic topographical distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This article addresses a group of clonal lymphoproliferations with usually <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e> and excellent clinical prognosis, such as pediatric follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and nodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Another group of early lesions not addressed in this review are virally induced lymphoproliferations which represent a grey zone between purely reactive lesions and malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and may pose significant diagnostic as well as clinical problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this review diagnostic criteria for early or in situ lesions and their distinction from partial infiltration by malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are described </plain></SENT>
