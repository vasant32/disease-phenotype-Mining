<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>T-cell-rich B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (TCRBCL) is a recently described variant of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It may arise de novo or secondary to follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present here seven cases of TCRBCL to emphasize a peculiar relationship to lymphocyte-predominant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Morphologically, the neoplastic populations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> TCRBCLs, in addition to centroblast-like and immunoblast-like cells, comprised a few L+H-like elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These neoplastic cells were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regularly scattered in a majority of reactive small T-lymphocytes as well as histiocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells of TCRBCL, including the L+H-like elements of TCRBCL, expressed LCA and L26 but did not stain for Leu-M1 and BerH2, as is the case with the Reed-Sternberg cell L+H variant of lymphocyte-predominant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the L26 immunoreaction in one of the cases, which otherwise presented as typical TCRBCL, disclosed a small subcapsular area resembling nodular paragranuloma because some few foci consisting of mature B lymphocytes with occasional L+H-like elements were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This also holds true for a second of the TCRBCLs presented that obviously coexisted with recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152269" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Hodgkin's paragranuloma</z:e> 10 years after the primary manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate a close connection between TCRBCL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1266194" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="LRCHL">lymphocyte-rich Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, and it may even be speculated as to whether TCRBCL represents merely a phenotypically different manifestation of this Hodgkin's subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the data presented here will not provide sufficient proof of this hypothesis, it seems clear that the nosology of TCRBCL in the context of current <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> classifications requires further elucidation </plain></SENT>
