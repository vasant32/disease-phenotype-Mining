<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease is biologically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, however, and aggressive instances associated with short survival are relatively common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because defects in the regulation of apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> are fundamental in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> pathogenesis, we hypothesized that deregulated expression of components of the Rb signaling pathway may promote cell proliferation, thereby complementing antecedent antiapoptotic mutations and producing more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We determined the differential expression of key cell-cycle regulatory proteins in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells by incorporating formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples from the initial, diagnostic biopsies from 127 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> into tissue microarrays, histologic sections of which were stained by immunohistochemistry for p53, pRb, p16(INK4a), and cyclin D3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were ascertained by visual inspection and then correlated with histopathological and clinical parameters, including overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings show that increased abundance of p53 or p16(INK4a) is associated with reduced overall survival and conventional pathological markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> including high histologic grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, subjective quantification of cell-cycle regulatory proteins by immunohistochemistry can identify biologically and clinically distinct subsets of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
