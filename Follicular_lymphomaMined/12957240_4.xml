<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to update our experience with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated with central lymphatic irradiation (CLI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 47 patients were treated with CLI between January 1993 and March 2000 in a prospective manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLI consisted of mantle, whole abdomen, and pelvic radiation fields with a 1-month break after each field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each field was treated to 3000-3060 cGy at 150-180 cGy per fraction followed by a boost dose of 900 cGy to the areas with gross disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age was 52 years (range: 29-73 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 29 males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses were as follows: follicular small cleaved-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 23 patients; follicular mixed-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 19 patients; follicular large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ann Arbor stages were as follows: I, 5 patients; II, 14 patients; and III, 28 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The International Prognostic Index (IPI) categories were as follows: 0, 14 patients; 1, 24 patients; and 2, 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anderson <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> Score was as follows: 0, 14 patients; 1, 18 patients; 2, 9 patients; 3, 4 patients; 4, 1 patient; and unknown, 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0002943'>abnormal LDH levels</z:mp>, and 11 patients had beta2M levels &gt;2 mg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Gender, pathology, stage, IPI, Anderson <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> Score, beta2M, and number of disease sites were examined for significance in freedom from progression (FFP) by univariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median follow-up was 54 months (range: 8-93 months) for the 45 surviving patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Every patient achieved a complete response, except for 1 patient whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> progressed to diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall survival and FFP were 94% and 53%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>No failure has yet been observed beyond 55 months of follow-up with 13 patients at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Patterns of failure were as follows: within the radiation field, 10; outside the fields, 4; and both, 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Of the seven variables investigated, beta2M &gt;2 mg/dL and IPI &gt;1 were the only significant adverse prognostic factors for FFP (p = 0.023 and 0.046, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CLI is well tolerated and seems to achieve durable FFP in about half of the patients with Stage I-III follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Most of the experiences with CLI come from the treatment of Stage III disease and are very similar to our previous experience with combined modality treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Whether a plateau in FFP can be maintained beyond 5 years remains to be seen </plain></SENT>
