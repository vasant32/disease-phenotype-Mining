<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the development of numerous treatment strategies to reduce the risk of progression, optimal therapeutic strategies for patients with FL remain undefined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with an anti-CD20 antibody linked to <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-131 or to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">yttrium</z:chebi>-90 has emerged as well-tolerated treatment after induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analyses to quantify the benefits of consolidative RIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched the CENTRAL and MEDLINE libraries, and conference abstracts for reports on phase II/III clinical trials that assessed RIT consolidation for patients with untreated FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extracted data included pretreatment disease status, patient characteristics, treatment regimen, response rates, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pooled estimates of complete response (CR), overall response (OR), 2- and 5-year PFS and OS rates were computed by using random effects models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight studies (n = 783) were included in the meta-analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CR rates after RIT ranged from 69.0% to 96.5%, 2-year PFS ranged from 64.8% to 86.1%, and 5-year PFS ranged from 47.0% to 67.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pooled estimates of the CR rate and OR rate were 82.7% (95% CI, 67.4%-91.7%) and 96.2% (95% CI, 90.4%-98.6%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pooled estimates for 5-year PFS and OS were 57.6% (95% CI, 47.8%-66.9%) and 90.1% (95% CI, 83.9%-94.1%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We believe that these aggregated data can further the discussion on RIT as a consolidation therapy and inform decisions on future study designs Additional studies are needed to compare the benefits of RIT consolidation to maintenance therapy with rituximab </plain></SENT>
