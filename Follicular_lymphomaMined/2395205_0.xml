<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Median age was 56 yr (range 8-86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 76 patients (17.6%) with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 355 with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 30 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 10 (33%) were found to have a bcl-2 rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence was lower than those reported in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This might contribute to the lower incidence of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 168 patients (39.0%) with nodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 263 with extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight-four cases arose from the stomach, 84 from Waldeyer's ring, 21 small intestine and 13 thyroid </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in stage I were treated with resection alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the same manner, patients with Waldeyer's ring <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in stage I were treated with radiotherapy alone </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, only 55% of patients with nodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in stage I were expected to survive for more than 10 years </plain></SENT>
