<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Low grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> comprise several well defined, clinically and immunophenotypically distinct disease entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Composite <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showing phenotypic characteristics of more than one of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> subtypes in the same site are rare, and both common and separate clonal origins of the two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> parts have been reported for cases studied by molecular methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the detailed immunohistochemical and molecular findings in three cases with features of composite low grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B-NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> contained morphologically distinct but interwoven compartments of different cell types, which exhibited discordant expression of several markers, including CD5, CD10, CD43, and cyclin D1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to their <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and phenotypes, they were classified as mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Case 1), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Case 2), and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Case 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PCR analysis of DNA obtained from whole tissue sections failed to reveal evidence for biclonality in any of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We therefore isolated cell populations with different antigen expression patterns by laser capture microdissection and analyzed them by polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing of clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements and oncogene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis revealed unrelated clonal rearrangements in each of the two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> parts in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases, suggesting distinct clonal origins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, Case 1 showed a bcl-2 rearrangement present only in the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> part </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that low grade B-NHL with two distinct morphological and immunophenotypic patterns in the same anatomical site are frequently biclonal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is in keeping with current classification schemes, which recognize subtypes of low grade B-NHL as separate disease entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates the power of laser capture microdissection in revealing molecular microheterogeneity in complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
