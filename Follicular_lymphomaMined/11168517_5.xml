<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Classically, reactivity for CD19, CD10, and strong positivity for the surface light chain immunoglobulin (SIg) are considered to be phenotypic signs typically expressed in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In practice, this pattern is difficult to identify since most neoplastic cells analysed by flow cytometry (FC) show weak intensity for CD19-Pe/Cy5 and for SIg and negativity for CD10-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used triple antigen combinations including two monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against CD10 (CD10-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> and CD10-Pe/Cy5) and a long-distance polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach to establish the phenotypic pattern of neoplastic cells carrying t(14;18)(q32;q21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neoplastic cells showed the following immunophenotype: stronger reactivity against CD20 than against CD19, positivity for CD22 and SIg and negativity for CD5, CD11c and CD10-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Characteristically, CD10-Pe/Cy5 was expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the samples with positive bcl-2/JH rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In FL, there was a high correlation between histologic diagnosis and reactivity against CD10-Pe/Cy5 (96% cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DLCL), CD10-Pe/Cy5 identified positive cases with t(14;18)(q32;q21) chromosomal translocation, whereas Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases reactivity against CD10-Pe/Cy5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, CD10-Pe/Cy5 is a useful antibody for identifying neoplastic cells carrying t(14;18)(q32;q21) in FL and DLCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In combination with other MoAbs, anti-CD10 (HI10a, Cy-<z:chebi fb="200" ids="28073">Chrome</z:chebi>) can be used to identify a characteristic phenotypic profile of FL against other <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
