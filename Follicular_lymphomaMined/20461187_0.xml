<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate retrospectively the usefulness of ECR imaging for the histologic classification of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ML) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional Review Board approval was obtained and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients provided informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study subjects included 15 patients with untreated ML who were histologically diagnosed with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL; n = 8) or diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>; n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent ECR imaging and the offset frequency was set at 7 ppm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median ECR values were 71% (range; 60.7 to 75.5) in FL and 54% (50.8 to 59.4) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median cellular density was 1.5 +/- 0.17 x 10(6) / mm(2) in FL and 1.0 +/- 0.70 x 10(6) / mm(2) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The correlation coefficient between the ECR values and cellular density in ML was 0.88 (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, assuming ECR value cut-off points of 60%, both sensitivity and specificity were 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A strong correlation between ECR and cellular density in ML is demonstrated and the ECR may be a useful technique to differentiate between FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
