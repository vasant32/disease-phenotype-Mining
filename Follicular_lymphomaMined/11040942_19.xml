<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: Detection of clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) rearrangements by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an attractive alternative to Southern blotting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnostics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the advantages and limitations of PCR in clonality analysis are still not fully appreciated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, clonality was analysed by means of PCR, focusing in particular on the sample size requirements when studying extremely small samples of polyclonal and monoclonal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS/METHODS: High resolution complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) PCR was used to investigate the minimum number of cells and the amount of tissue required for the detection of a polyclonal population, both for fresh cells and formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, frozen and paraffin wax embedded samples of 76 B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, 43 of which were tested by means of Southern blotting, were analysed to establish the sensitivity of this assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These specimens included 12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> (CLLs), nine mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCLs</z:e>), 10 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs), and 45 mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The specificity was tested on reactive lymph nodes (n = 19), tonsils (n = 4), peripheral blood lymphocyte fractions (n = 4), and biopsies with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> (n = 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In reactive tissue, 20 ng of high molecular weight DNA derived from 6.5-9 x 10(3) B cells was sufficient to obtain a polyclonal PCR result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With smaller amounts "pseudoclonality" could be induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When using paraffin wax blocks, undiluted DNA isolated from tonsillar tissue of at least 1 mm2 was necessary to obtain a polyclonal pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity required to detect clonality in paraffin wax embedded and frozen tissue by PCR for FL (40% and 60%, respectively) was lower than that for MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (60% and 86%, respectively), CLL (78% and 89%, respectively), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> (88% and 100%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PCR specificity was 96% and 100% for frozen and paraffin wax embedded tissue, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The minimum amount of template for CDR3 PCR is approximately 20 ng of high molecular weight DNA or 1 mm3 of B cell rich paraffin wax embedded <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tonsillar tissue, but care has to be taken to avoid pseudoclonality when low numbers of B cells are present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Duplicate or triplicate tests should be performed to avoid misinterpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The specificity of the PCR assay is almost 100%, whereas sensitivity depends on a combination of factors, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> type and tissue fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Because frozen samples yield better results, obtaining fresh material for the PCR assay is recommended, especially when analysing FL and MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
