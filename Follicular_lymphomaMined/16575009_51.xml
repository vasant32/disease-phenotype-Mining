<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Advanced-stage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is considered incurable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pace of improvements in treatment has been slow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This article analyzes five sequential cohorts of patients with stage IV follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated between 1972 and 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five consecutive studies (two were randomized trials) involving 580 patients were analyzed for overall survival (OS), failure-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e>), and survival after first relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A proportional hazards analysis, and subset analyses using the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> international prognostic index (FLIPI) score were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment regimens included: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> (CHOP-Bleo); CHOP-Bleo followed by interferon alfa (IFN-alpha); a rotation of three regimens (alternating triple therapy), followed by IFN-alpha; fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (FND) followed by IFN-alpha; and FND plus delayed versus concurrent rituximab followed by IFN-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Improvements in 5-year OS (from 64% to 95%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> (from 29% to 60%) indicate steady progress, perhaps partly due to more effective salvage therapies, but the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> data also indicate improved front-line therapies; these observations held true after controlling for differences in prognostic factors among the cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The FLIPI model adds rigor to and facilitates comparisons among the different cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An unexpected finding in this study was a trend toward an apparent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> plateau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Evolving therapy, including the incorporation of biologic agents, has led to stepwise significant outcome improvements for patients with advanced-stage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The apparent plateau in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> curve, starting approximately 8 to 10 years from the beginning of treatment, raises the issue of the potential curability of these patients </plain></SENT>
