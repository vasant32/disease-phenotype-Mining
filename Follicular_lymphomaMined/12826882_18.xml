<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Occasionally, primary large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (LBLs) arising in the spleen present with a micronodular pattern involving the splenic white pulp but sparing the red pulp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the nodules contain scattered large B cells in a background of numerous T cells and histiocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They can cause substantial difficulty in histologic diagnosis as the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> can mimic reactive and inflammatory lesions as well as other lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the histology and immunophenotype of the micronodular T-cell/histiocyte-rich LBL (MTLBL) of the spleen with a view to establish the characteristics that may be helpful in diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Paraffin-embedded material from 17 cases of MTLBL was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical features and histology were reviewed and immunohistochemistry was performed for immunoglobulins, CD20, CD79a, CD3, CD68, CD10, BCL6, BCL2, OCT-2, epithelial membrane antigen, CD30, CD138, and EBV markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age of presentation was 56 years, and the most frequent presenting features were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and B symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases showed a micronodular pattern of involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> nodules comprised a mixture of numerous CD3+ T cells and CD68+ histiocytes and scattered large CD20+ B cells with immunoglobulin light chain restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They were positive for BCL6 and OCT2 but negative for CD10, CD138, and EBV markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was variable expression of epithelial membrane antigen, Bcl-2, and CD30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No follicle dendritic cell meshwork infrastructure underlying the nodules could be demonstrated by staining for CD21 or CD35 antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The prognosis was poor; seven of the 12 cases with follow-up were dead within 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>MTLBL is unique variant of T-cell/histiocyte-rich diffuse LBL, characterized by primary splenic presentation and a micronodular architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The main differential diagnoses include <z:mp ids='MP_0002500'>granulomatous inflammation</z:mp>, Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
