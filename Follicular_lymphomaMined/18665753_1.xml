<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2/IgH gene rearrangement is detected in 80-90% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze the bcl-2/IgH rearrangement in FL <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients in Serbia, by PCR technique, correlate molecular findings with clinical characteristics and outcome and assess the prognostic significance of these rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred-seven patients (median age, 54 years; male/female ratio:60/47) diagnosed with FL were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA samples were obtained from paraffin embedded lymphoid tissue of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2/IgH rearrangement was assessed for the major breakpoint region (MBR), 5' MBR and the minor cluster region (mcr) breakpoints by PCR technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We detected a t(14;18) in 81.3% (87/107) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distribution of bcl-2-IgH rearrangement was as follows: 88,5% (77/87) in MBR breakpoint, 10,35% (9/87) in 5' MBR, whereas mcr bcl-2-IgH rearrangement was observed in one patient (1.15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No rearrangements were detected in remaining 20 patients (18.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first analyses of the frequency of the bcl-2/IgH gene rearrangement in Serbian FL patients, as well as in Eastern European countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between presence of bcl-2/IgH gene rearrangement and clinical outcome of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Incidence of bcl-2/IgH gene rearrangement in Serbian FL patients is relatively high, and similar to frequency in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Presence of this rearrangement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue is not of prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
