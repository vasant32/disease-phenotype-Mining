<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of molecular abnormalities in blood and bone marrow of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients including t(14;18) is less clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five patients from a single institution diagnosed with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> between1999 and 2005 were included into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was based on lymph node biopsy in 62 cases (83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine patients (52%) had G1 histological grade and 47 (63%) had entirely follicular growth pattern, as well as 9 patients (12%) had systemic symptoms and 33 (44%) were assigned to a good risk according to FLIPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median age of patients was 53 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During a median observation time of 3 years 63 patients (84%) required initiating anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five samples of peripheral blood and 65 samples of bone marrow were collected at the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bcl2 rearrangements including major breakpoint region and minor breakpoint cluster region were investigated using nested polymerase chain reaction technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The primary end points of the study were time to first line <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treatment and progression-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cells carrying t(14;18) were found in 31 cases (41%) including 29 samples of peripheral blood and 26 samples of bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Detection of t(14;18) in blood and bone marrow at diagnosis had no influence on clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Age, follicular growth pattern systemic symptoms, and FLIPI score above 1 were predictive for initiation of the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Follicular growth pattern, initial nodal involvement, serum LDH level, and FLIPI score above 1 were predictive for longer progression-free survival </plain></SENT>
