<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sometimes nodal disease is coupled with extranodal localizations, in which case the disease can follow a protracted clinical course characterized by remissions and relapses and, exceptionally, a fatal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exclusive extranodal localizations are rare and their prognosis variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study reports a case of RDD apparently limited to the liver coexisting with a diffuse (stage IV) relapsing follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient is alive and well 24 months after the diagnosis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is conceivable that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has induced RDD via an immunological disorder, possibly involving interleukin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The favorable outcome supports the belief that the prognosis of RDD is largely dependent on the number of extranodal sites involved, rather than on the specific sites themselves </plain></SENT>
