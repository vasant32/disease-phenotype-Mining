<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The morphologic, immunophenotypic, and clinical features of 16 cases of primary cutaneous follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, identified during a review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> PCBCL in the Scotland and Newcastle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Group database, were studied and the number of cases harboring t(14;18) assessed by polymerase chain reaction using primers to the major breakpoint cluster region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made with stage I follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> arising in lymph nodes and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> secondarily involving the skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases of primary cutaneous follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had undergone thorough staging, including physical examination and CT scans of chest and abdomen, with 15 of 16 cases also having bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> and/or trephine performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunophenotype of the lesions were similar to that expected in lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases displayed a follicular architecture complete with follicular dendritic cell networks and comprised an admixture of CD10 and/or bcl-6-positive neoplastic centrocytes and centroblasts with 13 of 16 cases also expressing bcl-2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None harbored t(14;18), a significantly different finding compared with cases of stage I nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (p &lt;0.001) and secondary cutaneous follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (p &lt;0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relapses occurred in five of 15 patients with a median time to first relapse of 20 months (range 1-73 months; mean 27.2 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These were multiple in two patients and involved extracutaneous sites in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The propensity for relapse was similar to that in a comparative cohort of stage I nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but the group of primary cutaneous follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were significantly more likely to attain complete remission; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of primary cutaneous follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were in complete remission when last seen compared with 49 of 87 patients with stage I nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (p &lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were encountered in 15 cases with a mean follow-up &gt;60 months (range 5-119 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results support the concept of a subtype of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lacking t(14;18) involving the major breakpoint cluster region, and with a propensity to arise in the skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite a high relapse rate patients with primary cutaneous follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are more likely to achieve complete remission and may ultimately have a more favorable long-term prognosis than those with equivalent nodal disease </plain></SENT>
