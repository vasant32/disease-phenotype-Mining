<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Concanavalin agglutinin (Con A) binding sites were studied in paraffin embedded lymph node specimens of reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> (12 cases) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (37) using the avidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-peroxidase complex method, and the results were compared with those of Peanut agglutinin (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi>) and lysozyme stains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Very similar to the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> stain, two categories of Con A receptor sites were observed: cytoplasmic and cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the reactive lymph nodes, the cells showing cytoplasmic receptor sites (CR+ cells) corresponded to macrophage-histiocytes and possibly dendritic reticulum cells in the H &amp; E stained sections, while those showing cell surface receptor sites (SR+) corresponded to lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unlike the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> binding, however, the staining reaction of SR+ lymphoid cells was weak, and another staining pattern, a dot-like stain, was observed in some lymphocytes, both SR+ and SR- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, CR+ histiocytes were distinctly displayed within the follicular centers in 25 of 37 cases, including 12 cases in which <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> stains on adjacent or nearby sections were negative for intrafollicular macrophage-histiocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, Con A stains were positive for the intrafollicular CR+ cells in four of the five cases in which lysozyme stains were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Many of these intrafollicular CR+ cells contained inclusion-like cytoplasmic globules and/or vacuoles, a hallmark of the large CR+ cells of germinal centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that macrophage-histiocytes of presumably germinal center origin are retained in neoplastic follicular centers in varying degrees, and Con A might be a useful marker for macrophage-histiocytes in paraffin-embedded routine pathological specimens, in addition to the currently accepted markers, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> and lysozyme </plain></SENT>
