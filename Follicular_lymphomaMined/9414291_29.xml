<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although highly responsive, advanced stage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is not curable with conventional treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This relative resistance is thought to be due to the t(14;18) that results in the constitutive overexpression of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-inhibiting protein bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the observation that FL cells are sensitive to treatment in vivo and prone to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> on in vitro culture questions whether bcl-2 alone is responsible for the pathogenesis and clinical behavior of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, multiple genes are likely to be involved in both the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> and the clinical course of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined whether expression of other bcl-2 family genes might also be operative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that FL cells display a different pattern of expression of bcl-2 family proteins from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> germinal center (GC) B cells that are thought to be their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterpart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FL cells express the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-suppressor proteins bcl-2, bcl-xL, and mcl-1; whereas GC B cells express bcl-xL and mcl-1 but also the proapoptotic proteins bax-alpha and bad </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although maintaining constitutive levels of bcl-2 and mcl-1, FL cells are not protected from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> when cultured in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Their propensity to undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is temporally associated with downregulation of bcl-xL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More importantly, activation of FL cells via CD40 not only prevents downregulation but increases the level of bcl-xL expression and results in promotion of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results support the hypothesis that the overexpression of bcl-2 is not the only antiapoptotic mechanism responsible for the pathogenesis of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Survival of FL cells is determined by a number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-inhibiting proteins, among which bcl-xL appears to have the most critical role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that, although FL cells are malignant, they respond to microenvironmental signals such as CD40L that appear to contribute to their survival through the upregulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-inhibiting proteins </plain></SENT>
