<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 40-year-old female diagnosed with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was treated with rituximab-combined chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although she achieved complete remission, she developed progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001896'>reticulocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow examination revealed features of pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876991" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemophagocytosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the appearance of large pronormoblasts suggested that she was infected with parvovirus B19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Excess <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA in her bone marrow confirmed that her illness was caused by persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">parvovirus B19 infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum immunoglobulin levels decreased beyond the lower <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limit, which indicated that her humoral immunity was impaired after rituximab-combined chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although she had been infected with parvovirus B19, she was re-infected and failed to control the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High-titer immunoglobulin against parvovirus B19 was intravenously administrated and resulted in remarkable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001923'>reticulocytosis</z:hpo> and improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High-titer immunoglobulin, which contained a sufficient amount of neutralizing antibodies against parvovirus B19, likely inactivated most viruses in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We successfully eradicated the virus after 2 courses of high-dose therapy at 0.5 g/kg/day every week followed by 8 courses of maintenance therapy at 0.1 g/kg/day every other week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is important to consider that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">parvovirus B19 infection</z:e> is a possible cause of progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients treated with rituximab-combined chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We propose that the use of high-titer immunoglobulin against parvovirus B19 may enable such immunocompromised patients to eradicate the virus before sufficient immune system reconstruction </plain></SENT>
