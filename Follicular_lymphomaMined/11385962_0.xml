<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, most studies used four weekly doses and time to treatment failure (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi>) and overall survival (OS) could be considered very short: 11.0 and 13.6 months respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We started a pilot study to evaluate if six infusions at the same doses and schedule could improve the outcome in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients with refractory follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> heavily treated with chemotherapy (&gt; 2 regimens), radiotherapy and biological modifiers were enrolled in a pilot study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They received 6 weekly doses, at 375 mg/m2, of monoclonal anti CD 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In an intent to treat analysis, overall response was 76%, of which 47% (8 patients) were complete response and 5 patients were partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 28.6 months, 7 complete responders remain alive, free of disease, and 2 partial responses remain stable without additional treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi> has not been reached; yet, actuarial curves showed that at 3 years, 53% of patients are alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The four patients who were failure died secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (OS) at 3-year was 76% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was mild, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients completed the schedule on time and doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The addition of two doses of anti CD 20 clearly improved OS and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi> in a group of patients with refractory follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> heavily treated and with poor prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the number is too short to draw definitive conclusions; more clinical trials are necessary to determine if 4 or 6 doses of anti CD 20 therapy are better in this setting of patients </plain></SENT>
