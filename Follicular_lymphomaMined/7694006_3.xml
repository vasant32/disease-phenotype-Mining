<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we determined the level of expression of BCL-2/IgH in 18 follicular center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> containing a t(14;18) translocation involving the major breakpoint region and five non-neoplastic lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BCL-2/IgH transcripts were demonstrated in 16 follicular center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases (five high, 11 low) and were not present in any of the five non-neoplastic lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the two follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases in which BCL-2/IgH transcripts could not be detected by RT-PCR, PCR amplification of genomic DNA indicated this was not due to primer selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, non-expression was confirmed at the protein level by immunoperoxidase studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore conclude that these represent true negative cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is the first time primary follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases have been quantitatively studied at the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> level for expression of BCL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that RT-PCR is a sensitive method for determining levels of expression of this oncogene and may be useful in studying the involvement of BCL-2 in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
