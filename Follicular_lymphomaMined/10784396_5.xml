<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the t(14;18) and/or bcl2 protein expression are less common in FLCL than in its low-grade counterparts, we sought to determine whether these features were predictive of survival as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 50 patients with FLCL who were treated with curative intent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18) was found by cytogenetic analysis in 56% of the patients and bcl2 protein was expressed by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in 73%, but neither was predictive of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, abnormalities of chromosome 17p and the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21 were adverse predictors of survival, as were a number of clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that neither the absence of the t(14;18) nor the lack of bcl2 expression explain the good response of a subset of patients with FLCL to curative therapy </plain></SENT>
