<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has been somewhat neglected by the research community, but recent genomic studies have identified key genetic lesions in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, a new murine model is available to explore the function of these lesions in the development, progression, and treatment of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, new small-molecule inhibitors are now available that target key pathways in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> including B-cell receptor signaling and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modifiers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is a very common and still incurable form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, recent genomic and in-vivo biological studies are beginning to unveil the molecular drivers of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This coincides with the development of effective small-molecule inhibitors against key targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together these developments suggest that we are at a long overdue watershed moment in the treatment of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
