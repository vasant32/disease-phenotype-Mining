<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The breakpoints on chromosome 18 are at one of two sites, designated mbr and mcr, in the bcl-2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A polymerase chain reaction strategy has been developed for amplification and direct sequencing of the resultant 14q+ and 18q- reciprocal junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the amplified 14q+ junction established that 21 tumours contained a bcl-2 (mbr) sequence to an immunoglobulin JH region, the majority being J5 or J6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A nonrandom pattern of breakpoints within the mbr region was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clustering of the breakpoint occurred with over 60% of the translocations clustering within 10 bases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a second cluster within the mbr 50 bases 3' of the first cluster </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of these junctions had an unusual configuration with the bcl-2 and JH sequences separated by a recognisable DH region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that at least some of the junctional sequences, previously thought of as N insertions, may be fragments of unrecognised DH regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> it was possible to sequence the reciprocal 18q- junction, showing it to consist of a DH/bcl-2 (mbr) fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analysis of both reciprocal junctions for a translocation in the mcr region of bcl-2, showed that this 18q- junction also consisted of DH fused to a bcl-2 sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast to previous analyses, which demonstrated either loss or duplication of bcl-2 sequences at the breakpoints, the bcl-2 sequence was conserved during the mbr and mcr translocations in this study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
