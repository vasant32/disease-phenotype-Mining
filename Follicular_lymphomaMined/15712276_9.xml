<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> can be difficult to differentiate cytologically from other small cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the distinction is important, because mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is more aggressive than other small cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is helpful in diagnosing mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> on fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> (FNA) specimens by detecting the t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation that is characteristic of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-five lymph node FNA specimens from 53 patients were analyzed using FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 2-color FISH assay that employed probes at the 14q32 (immunoglobulin H) and 11q13 (dual-colored, directly labeled cyclin D1) loci was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of single-fusion and double-fusion signals in 200 cells was counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If &gt; or = 14% single-fusion signals or &gt; or = 1.5% double-fusion signals or both were present, then the sample was considered FISH positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The findings were correlated with the cytologic, histologic, and immunophenotypic findings in each specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 55 cytology specimens, 17 were mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and 38 were nonmantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including 16 small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (9 of 16 in an accelerated phase), 5 large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 5 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 7 transformed large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (Richter syndrome), 3 atypical lymphoid proliferations, and 2 low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 17 mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were positive by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, there were six small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (two in accelerated phase), one transformed large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and one large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of follicular origin positive by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean number of single-fusion and double-fusion signals, respectively, was 36 and 33 in mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> specimens and 19 and 3 in positive nonmantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The detection of the t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation by FISH analysis was helpful in diagnosing mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> on FNA specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Double-fusion signals were more specific for mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> than single-fusion signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In rare instances, other non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> also showed increased numbers of single-fusion signals that were not necessarily indicative of the t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in an initial diagnosis of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, significant numbers of double-fusion FISH signals should be identified and interpreted in conjunction with the cytologic and immunologic studies </plain></SENT>
