<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the transformed stage the disease behaves as an invasive metastasizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> or as a blast cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>; in both cases the transformation is associated with the appearance of a new cell type, undifferentiated and distinct from that present before <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of transformation, which may however persist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The syndrome resembling <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> occurs only in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
