<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 12 courses of the chemotherapy regimen CHVP (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, adriamycin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>) plus interferon-alpha2a (CHVP+I arm) over 18 months or 6 courses of the same chemotherapy regimen combined with 6 infusions of 375 mg/m(2) rituximab and interferon for the same time period (R-CHVP+I arm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 5 years, event-free survival estimates were, respectively, 37% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29%-44%) and 53% (95% CI, 45%-60%) in the CHVP+I and R-CHVP+I arm (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five-year overall survival estimates were not statistically different in the CHVP+I (79%; 95% CI, 72%-84%) and R-CHVP+I (84%; 95% CI, 78%-84%) arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate regression analysis, event-free survival was significantly influenced by both the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index score (hazard ratio = 2.08; 95% CI, 1.6%-2.8%) and the treatment arm (hazard ratio = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.44%-0.78%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a 5-year follow-up, the combination of rituximab with CHVP+I provides superior disease control in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients despite a shorter duration of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
