<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AID has been reported to be specifically expressed in the germinal center (GC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) cells are known to be exposed to GC reaction, as characterized by a high degree of SHM with some <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in terms of intraclonal microheterogeneity and antigen selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of SHM pattern in FL intrigued us to investigate the AID expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AID expression was investigated in 19 FL materials consisting of 15 cases of FL fresh cells and four cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 10 fresh cells and three cell lines expressed AID, but the others did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SHM was investigated in 12 fresh cells and four cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ongoing mutation was significantly different between AID-positive and AID-negative FL fresh cells (unpaired Student's t-test, P=0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ongoing mutation was not seen in any of the cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AID expression was associated with the ongoing mutation in FL fresh cells (two-tailed Pearson's coefficient correlation, r=0.899, P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The switch off of AID expression may start in the B-lineage differentiation stage counterpart of FL after optimizing SHM, indicated by the cessation of the ongoing mutation in AID-negative FL fresh cells </plain></SENT>
