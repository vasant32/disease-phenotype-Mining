<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The conventional treatments of indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> do not extend the survival rate, nor do they cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent directions are centered on using several new drugs that are capable of overcoming the mechanisms that are resistant to recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The initiation of immunotherapy (Rituximab in 1997) seems to have changed the natural evolution of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is possible that resistance to healing in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> may be neutralized with Rituximab by suppressing STAT-1 positive macrophages that are present in the cellular microenvironment.Thereinafter, the re-evaluation of recent models of prognostic and therapeutic paradigmas that were used in FL became compulsory.The purpose of the paper is to compare the evolution of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the period of response, according to the treatments.Material and method: The study group consisted of the 71 patients diagnosed with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, out of a total of 767 malignant lymphatic proliferations with B cells, for a period of 7 years (2002-2008), at the Hematology Department, Hospital Coltea, Bucharest and Hematology Department, Universitary Hospital, BucharestResults and conclusions: Combining chemotherapy with Rituximab had better results compared to the same chemotherapy, administered alone, both in induction and in case of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate in our study group was 74.7%, out of which 42.3% complete remissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 84.61% in the Rituximab group, compared to 68.88% in patients without Rituximab </plain></SENT>
