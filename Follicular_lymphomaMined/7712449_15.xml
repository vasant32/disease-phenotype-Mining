<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The many treatment approaches reported in the literature attest to the lack of agreement on its best management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The treatment experiences of patients with Stage I or II follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who were at risk for at least 5 years were reviewed to assess their survival, disease free survival, and patterns of failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1974 and 1988, 144 patients with Stage I or II follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were treated at The University of Texas M </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Initial staging studies included lymphangiography in 87% of the patients, computerized tomography of the abdomen and pelvis in 60%, bone marrow biopsy in 98%, and diagnostic or staging laparotomy in 33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-five patients were treated with regional radiotherapy, 84 patients with combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and 15 patients were treated with chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 8.7 years (range, 48-182 months) the actuarial survival rates at 5, 10, and 15 years were 81, 69, and 63%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The freedom from relapse (FFR) rates were 66, 56, and 46%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The FFR rate was better for patients treated with chemotherapy-radiotherapy than for patients treated with radiotherapy alone (63 vs. 35% at 15 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, there were no relapses after 7.5 years in patients treated with chemotherapy-radiotherapy, but relapses continued even beyond 15 years in patients treated with radiotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis for each of the treatment groups revealed age to be the only significant prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in survival or disease free survival rates for the three histologic subtypes of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy may have increased the probability of cure for patients with Stages I or II follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
