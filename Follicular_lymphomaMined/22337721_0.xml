<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lymphomagenesis</z:e> appears stepwise from the t(14;18) translocation, through FL-like cells, to FL in situ, then to overt FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surface Ig is mandatory and carries a striking V-region modification because of introduction of glycan addition sites during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These are positively selected and acquire unusual high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannoses</z:chebi>, which interact with lectins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Ig-associated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannoses</z:chebi> appear essential for FL, providing a disease- specific target for antibody attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antibody therapy is currently focused on anti-CD20 (rituximab), which appears to rely predominantly on the FcÎ³ module recruiting suitably activated macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunogloblulin and, to some extent, CD20, can each escape antibody attack in vitro by modulation, but this is difficult to demonstrate clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Instead, studies of anti-CD20 therapy of FL suggest that effector modulation, similar to that seen in the suppression of autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> by infusions of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human IgG, may be important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both antigenic and effector modulations might be minimized by repeated small doses of more potent antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clearly, mechanisms of attack vary with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, the target molecule, and the antibody design, offering opportunities for optimizing this promising strategy </plain></SENT>
