<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes differences in the distribution patterns were observed between: (1) B and T cells, (2) central and peripheral cells, and (3) resting and activated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The findings suggested that cell density is determined by cell lineage the degree of differentiation and the stage of functional activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Marked differences in the density distribution profiles were also observed among certain types of morphologically distinguishable lymphoproliferations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To some extent density analyses enabled the discrimination between CLL, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> as well as between O-ALL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Density profiles of malignant lymphocytes failed to disclose any features specific for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>But they revealed some similarities with distinct subsets of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes, i.e. between: (1) CLL and bone marrow lymphoid cells, (2) follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and follicular centre cells, and (3) lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and activated lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings are further evidence supporting the hypothesis that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> of phenotypically different lymphoproliferations takes place at different levels of lymphocyte differentiation </plain></SENT>
