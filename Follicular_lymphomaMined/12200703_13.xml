<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We and others have previously reported new recurrent breakpoints (3'BCL2 and 5'mcr) which could be easily analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we characterized the BCL2 breakpoints in 113 untreated patients with t(14;18)-positive FL and correlated their location with the location of JH break and with the clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Breakpoints were respectively located at the major breakpoint region (MBR) in 73 cases (65%), at the minor cluster region (mcr) in 10 cases (9%), at 3'BCL2 in 14 cases (12%) and at 5'mcr in seven cases (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, the breakpoint could not be located in nine patients (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>5'mcr cases were associated with bulky and high-stage disease, with frequent extranodal involvement and bone marrow infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival studies did not show any correlation between breakpoint location and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The joining JH6 segment was the most frequently involved whatever the breakpoint location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, unusual BCL2 breakpoints are found in about 20% of newly diagnosed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and their study should be considered in the investigation of BCL2-JH rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was not possible, in this series, to demonstrate any correlation between breakpoint location and either initial characteristics of the disease or survival of the patients </plain></SENT>
