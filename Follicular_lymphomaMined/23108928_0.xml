<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among new agents, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> seems to play a pivotal role in the regulation of several cell pathways involved in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After results were obtained with clinical trials, we aimed to observe treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> in everyday clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed a multicenter retrospective analysis to assess the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> in heavily pretreated (median number of previous therapies 4, range 2-6) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients in an off-label setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">Bortezomib</z:chebi> therapy was scheduled for 4-6 cycles (1.3 mg/m(2) biweekly) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data from 50 patients were collected: 22% had a complete remission, 26% obtained a partial response and the remaining 52% was non-responder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to histotype, we observed an overall response rate (ORR) of 51.6% in mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, an ORR of 60% among follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, and an ORR of 50% in the indolent nonfollicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients obtained a response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Extra-hematological toxicity was really mild, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> occurred in only 5 patients; hematological toxicity was grades 3-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in nine patients and grades 3-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in only three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> as single agent resulted safe and effective in a subset of heavily pretreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients with usually poor outcome </plain></SENT>
