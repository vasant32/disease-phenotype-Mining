<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except one case with a deletion were graphed by frequency of replacement mutation, the 100 cases could be separated into two groups: 24 cases with zero, one and two mutations (germline or low frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo>); and 76 cases with three or more mutations (medium to high frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While most mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases (11/13) showed germline or low frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (11/11), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (three of three cases), plasma cell <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> (seven of seven cases) and most cases of diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>; 42/47) belonged to the latter group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These 76 cases, therefore, may be considered to show somatic hypermutation </plain></SENT>
