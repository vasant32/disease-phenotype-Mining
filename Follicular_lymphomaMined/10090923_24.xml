<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although mutation occurs specifically in B cells during the germinal center reaction, it remains a matter of debate whether the mutation machinery also targets non-Ig genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied mutations in the 5' noncoding region of the Bcl6 gene in different subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found frequent hypermutation in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (25 of 59 = 42%) (germinal center cell origin) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (19 of 45 = 42%) (postgerminal center), but only occasionally in mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1 of 21 = 4.8%) (pregerminal center) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most mutations were outside the motifs potentially important for transcription, suggesting they were not important in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> but may, like Ig mutation, represent an inherent feature of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> precursor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cell counterparts microdissected from a reactive tonsil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bcl6 mutation was found in 13 of 24 (54%) clones from the germinal centre but only in 1 of 24 (4%) clones from the naive B cells of the mantle zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency, distribution, and nature of these mutations were similar to those resulting from the Ig hypermutation process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results show unequivocal evidence of non-Ig gene hypermutation in germinal center B cells and provide fresh insights into the process of hypermutation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
