<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis of 133 patients with localized nodal and extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphomata whose staging investigations included marrow aspirate and lymphography shows that more than 60% remain alive and disease-free 4 years after initial therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Further relapses may occur in this group, particularly in the nodular lymphomata, but so far the majority of relapses and three quarters of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from disease have occurred within 2 years of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the entire group of patients, only 15% showed an unequivocally nodular pattern and a further 25% a partially nodular, partially diffuse pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, 60% of patients had diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but differences were observed depending upon the site of presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the nodal Stages I and II cases, whereas only 4 of 55 patients with supradiaphragmatic disease showed a nodular pattern, 12 of 24 infradiaphragmatic presentations had nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This difference was reflected in a lower relapse rate in the latter group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mediastinal involvement was uncommon but carried a grave prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As far as it was possible to judge, extension to adjacent nodal areas as a cause of relapse was not a common problem and, as observed previously, relapse was much commoner to a wide variety of extranodal sites than is the case with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this series marrow involvement was documented in only 7 patients but this surprisingly low frequency might be due in part to infrequent marrow sampling after the initial investigations were completed </plain></SENT>
