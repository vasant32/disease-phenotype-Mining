<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With this broad spectrum of regimens to choose from the decision has become a challenging exercise for both patients and oncologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the recent introduction of new agents such as rituximab, fludarabine, and combinations based on these, the management of relapsed cases can be similarly confusing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More aggressive approaches such as high-dose chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow transplant and more recently allogeneic bone marrow transplant have also been used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently the technique of "mini-allo transplants" has been introduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It utilizes a less myelosuppressive conditioning chemotherapy regimen based on fludarabine which is immunosuppressive enough to allow engraftment of the donor marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since it is less myelotoxic it is better tolerated, and this has allowed us to significantly extend the age cut-off for allogeneic transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these advances provide us with a more extensive armamentarium, but at the same time they confront physicians with new challenges in choosing from a large and continuously growing therapeutic menu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this review of the alternative therapies a panel of three expert hemato-oncologists each discuss their approach to the management of a 49-year-old patient with a relapsed indolent follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dr. Horning discusses the traditional alternatives available for this patient such as standard chemotherapy combinations or the watch-and-wait approach in Section I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In Section II, Dr. Kaminski reviews the different therapeutic monoclonal antibody options such as rituximab, Bexxar (<z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">Iodine</z:chebi>-labeled anti-CD20) and Ytrium-labeled anti-CD20 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic transplants are increasingly more popular for the treatment of indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> because they can provide an immune-mediated graft-versus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In Section III, Dr. Richard Champlin reviews various transplant options including autologous, allogeneic and mini-allogeneic transplants </plain></SENT>
