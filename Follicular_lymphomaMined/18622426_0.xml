<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The basic molecular defect consists of the t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation, juxtaposing the B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> protein 2 gene BCL2 to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus IGH@, and leading to the antiapoptotic BCL2 protein overproduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Variations in the t(14;18) are rare and can be classified into two categories: (i) simple variants, involving chromosomes 18 and 2, or 22, in which the fusion partner of BCL2 is the light-chain IGK@ or IGL@; (ii) complex variant translocations occurring among chromosomes 14, 18 and other chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> case showing BCL2 overexpression, detected by immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative PCR, consequently to the formation of a novel fusion gene between the 5' of the lymphoid nuclear transcriptional activator gene AFF3 at 2q11.2, and the 3' of BCL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case shows evidence, for the first time, of BCL2 overexpression consequently to the fusion of BCL2 to a non-IG partner locus </plain></SENT>
