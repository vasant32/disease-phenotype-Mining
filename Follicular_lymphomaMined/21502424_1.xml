<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the efficacy of 2 germinal center B-cell markers, HGAL and LMO2, in the separation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> derived from small B cells, particularly follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) and marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> occurring in nodal, extranodal, splenic, and bone marrow sites using immunohistochemical analysis for CD10, BCL6, BCL2, HGAL, and LMO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that HGAL and LMO2 are sensitive and specific markers for detecting FL in nodal and extranodal sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> markers were down-regulated in FL infiltrates in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD10 and HGAL were expressed in a subset of FLs in the bone marrow and were highly correlated with each other and with CD21, a marker of follicular dendritic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that HGAL and LMO2 should be considered in immunohistochemical panels used for the routine workup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> derived from small B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the bone marrow, staining for HGAL or CD10 can be helpful in making a diagnosis of FL, although they are absent in a subset of cases </plain></SENT>
