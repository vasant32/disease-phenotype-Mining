<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The LAZ3 gene has been identified on chromosome band 3q27, which is the breakpoint of reciprocal chromosome translocations observed in B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the translocations affect various chromosome sites including the immunoglobulin gene loci, molecular studies have indicated that the breakages are clustered within a 10-kb-long major translocation cluster region (MTC) at band 3q27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we have used a genomic probe from the MTC to study 51 Japanese patients having B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> with regard to rearrangement of LAZ3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study detected rearrangement in 12 cases out of 51; the rearrangements occurred within a limited region close to the first exon of the LAZ3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight cases out of 12 with rearrangement had diffuse large cell NHL and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> variant, including one case transformed from a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> carrying the BCL2 rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the rearrangement was also identified in two NHL patients showing a follicular growth pattern, in one case with indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and in one case with high-grade small noncleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with a bulky abdominal mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis revealed t(3;14)(q27;q32) in 2 cases, t(3;22)(q27;q11) in 3, and a newly identified translocation t(3;6)(q21) in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LAZ3 expression was demonstrated in cells carrying the LAZ3 rearrangement, suggesting transcriptional deregulation of the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results are compatible with previous cytogenetic reports in which the 3q27 translocation was observed in 15-20% of NHL; however, patients with the LAZ3 rearrangements exhibited a wide range of clinico-pathologic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, there is no clear consistent association of the 3q27 translocation with a specific subtype of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
