<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to determine the pattern of Bcl-2, CD10 and Bcl-6 expression in relation to t(14;18) translocation in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from a cohort of a multi-ethnic Asian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-two cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were retrieved for immunohistochemistry, and t(14;18) translocation analysis by polymerase chain reaction and fluorescent in-situ hybridization techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 expression was present in 74% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD10 expression was also relatively low (61%), with decreasing frequency of expression in high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bcl-6 protein was expressed in most of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (88%) regardless of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18) translocation was detected in 46 cases (74%) with an extremely high rate of t(14;18) translocation in ethnic Indian cases (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The frequency of t(14;18) translocation in this series of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was higher when compared with previous Asian reports, but in accordance with European and North American findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD10 expression is strongly associated with a t(14;18) translocation event, but the overall CD10 expression was relatively low, possibly due to the high proportion of high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> in the series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>t(14;18) translocation was not associated with Bcl-2 or Bcl-6 expression </plain></SENT>
