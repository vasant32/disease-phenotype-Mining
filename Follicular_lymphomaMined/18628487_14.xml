<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because TP53 mutations are associated with poor prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>, we investigated the prognostic value of TP53 mutation at diagnosis in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous TP53 mutation was detected in 12 of 185 (6%) analyzed cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutation was associated with older age (P = .02) and higher International Prognostic Index score (P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, TP53 mutation correlated with shorter progression-free survival (P &lt; .001) and overall survival (P = .009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TP53 mutation was associated with low expression of the immune-response 1 gene expression signature (P = .016) and with an unfavorable gene expression-based survival predictor score (P &lt; .001), demonstrating for the first time that molecular features of the malignant cell may correlate with the nature of the immune response in FL </plain></SENT>
