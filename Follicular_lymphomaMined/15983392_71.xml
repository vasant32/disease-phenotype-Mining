<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Despite several new treatment options, single- and multi-institution analyses have not clarified whether survival patterns in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) patients have changed in recent decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We undertook a study using a large population-based registry to analyze survival patterns among patients with FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> codes were used to identify 14,564 patients diagnosed with FL between 1978 and 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Observed median survival times, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, proportional <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> hazard ratios, and relative survival rates were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Joinpoint regression analysis was used to identify trends in annual adjusted <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> hazard ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An improvement in survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with FL was observed between each of three diagnosis eras (1978 to 1985, 1986 to 1992, and 1993 to 1999) by log-rank tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients with stage-specific data, the median survival time improved from 84 months (95% CI, 81 to 88 months) in the 1983 to 1989 era to 93 months (95% CI, 89 to 97 months) in the 1993 to 1999 era </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar findings were identified across sex and age groups and for subsets including advanced-stage, large-cell FL and the combined subset of small cleaved- and mixed-cell FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The inter-era survival advantage observed in white patients was not observed for black patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> decreased by 1.8% per year over the 1983 to 1999 observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The survival of patients with FL in the United States has improved over the last 25 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The survival improvement may be a result of the sequential application of effective therapies and improved supportive care </plain></SENT>
