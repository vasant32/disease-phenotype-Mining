<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was performed as an open-label non-randomized multicenter phase-II trial and included patients older than 18 years of age with relapsed advanced-stage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) grades I and II, according to the REAL classification, or with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e>/centrocytic (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1511945" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CB/CC</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> according to the Kiel classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four weekly doses of 375 mg/m2 rituximab were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 38 patients from eight centers were included between January 1997 and January 1998 and were evaluable for response and toxicity on an intention to treat basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age was 55 years (range 26-75 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (35%) were in first relapse, 11 patients (30%) in second, and 13 patients (35%) in third relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median time between primary diagnosis and study entry was 4.6 years (range 0.9-14.7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients tolerated the application of rituximab without adverse events; in 13 cases the infusion rate had to be reduced because of side effects; in two patients the application was stopped because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011855'>pharyngeal edema</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340865" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anaphylactoid reaction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequent side effects were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (13 patients) and rigor (13 patients); 65% of the side effects were observed after the first infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty grade-III/IV side effects were considered to be related to treatment: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphocytopenia</z:hpo> (3), granalocytopenia (1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (1), hyperglycermia (1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> (1), plasmatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation disorder</z:e> (1), <z:mp ids='MP_0001954'>shortness of breath</z:mp> (2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000992'>photosensitivity</z:hpo> (1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> (1), chills (1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> (1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> lysis (1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (1), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011855'>pharyngeal edema</z:hpo> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eight patients were not eligible for assessment of response because of non-follicular subtypes of low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (n =6) or early termination of therapy at the first infusion because of severe side effects (n =2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From the 30 evaluable cases with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, five patients achieved a complete remission (CR) (17%), nine patients a partial remission (PR) (30%), and two patients a minor response (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 47% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The median time to treatment progression (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) was 201 days (range 64-293 days), with five patients experiencing long-lasting remissions of 214-293 days duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In three patients, the rituximab-induced remission exceeded the preceding progression-free interval substantially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Bulky disease (P=0.058) and/or bone-mar row involvement (P=0.046) were associated with poor response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study confirms the moderate treatment-related toxicity and the high antilymphoma activity of rituximab in patients with relapsed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to determine the role of rituximab in the first-line treatment of these disorders and its combination with conventional chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
