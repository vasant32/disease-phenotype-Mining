<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Quantitative methylation profiling was performed using the Illumina GoldenGate Assay in untreated follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) (164), paired pre- and post-transformation FL (20), benign haematopoietic (24) samples and purified B and T cells from two FL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methylation values allowed separation of untreated FL samples from controls with one exception, based primarily on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-specific gains of methylation typically occurring within CpG islands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genes that are targets for epigenetic repression in stem cells by Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 were significantly over-represented among hypermethylated genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methylation profiles were conserved in sequential FL and t-FL biopsies, suggesting that widespread methylation represents an early event in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> and may not contribute substantially to transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant (P&lt;0.05) correlation between FL methylation values and reduced gene expression was shown for up to 28% of loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methylation changes occurred predominantly in B cells with variability in the amount of non-malignant tissue between samples preventing conclusive correlation with survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This represents an important caveat in attributing prognostic relevance to methylation and future studies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> will optimally require purified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> populations to address the impact of methylation on clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
