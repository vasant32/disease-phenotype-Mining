<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, classical banding cytogenetic studies suggested that follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs) grade 3 with preserved maturation to centrocytes (FL3A) are closely related to FL grades 1 and 2 and frequently harbor the t(14;18), whereas FL grade 3B, consisting of centroblasts exclusively, do frequently show 3q27 alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify the prevalence of BCL6 and BCL2 rearrangements in FL and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DLBLs), we performed a large scale bicolor interphase cytogenetic (fluorescence in situ hybridization) study on 188 well-characterized B-NHLs classified according to the World Health Organization Classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> of the Lymphoid Tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BCL6 rearrangements were detected in a significantly higher number of FL3B with a DLBL component (12 of 22, 55%) compared with purely diffuse nodal DLBLs (19 of 77, 25%) and DLBLs with a well-documented primary extranodal origin (2 of 27, 7%) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five FL3B without a DLBL component were negative for both t(14;18) and 3q27 aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FL grades 1/2 and FL3A were t(14;18)-positive in 88% and 64% of cases, respectively, but 3q27 alterations were identified in only four FL3A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data exemplify different genetic pathways in the genesis of FLs with a high content of centroblasts and suggest that 3q27 rearrangements are predominantly associated with FL grade 3B harboring a DLBL component </plain></SENT>
