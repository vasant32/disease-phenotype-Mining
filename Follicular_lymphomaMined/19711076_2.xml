<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the relative frequency of different subtypes of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Kuwait based on the Revised European-American <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (REAL) classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From 1998 to 2006, 738 subjects were included that were registered with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry at the Kuwait <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Control Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expert pathologists reviewed histological slides from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed detailed immunohistochemical studies and classified subjects based on the REAL classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of different types of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was determined based on age, sex, site of disease, and ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ethnicity groups comprised Kuwaiti Arabs, non Kuwaiti Arabs, Asians, and others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of B- and T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was 81.8% and 14.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common age group was 41-60 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The three most common subtypes in Kuwaiti Arabs were diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (46.5%), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (15.5%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mycosis fungoides</z:e> (9.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In non-Kuwaiti Arabs, the most common subtypes were diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (48%), B-cell small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (15.8%), and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (12.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, non-Kuwaiti Arabs exhibited the highest prevalence (59%), and 54% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases had extranodal presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared to the Western world, Kuwait had a lower prevalence of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, a higher prevalence of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and extranodal presentation, and a high frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mycosis fungoides</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Compared to other parts of Asia, Kuwait had a lower frequency of peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
