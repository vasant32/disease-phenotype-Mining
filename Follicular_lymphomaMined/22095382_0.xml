<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed 564 four-color FC files from B-NHLs, assessing LC staining with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Discrepancies in LC expression between mAbs and pAbs were present in 9.2% of cases, mainly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e>; 11.1%), diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>; 10.2%), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (9.5%), and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (11.1%) and most frequently in body fluids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Equal proportions of cases were LC+ only with pAbs (4.8%) or mAbs (4.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Negative LC expression with both antibodies was present in 7.5% of cases, most frequently in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (21.6%) and body fluids (27.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evaluation with both mAbs and pAbs increases the sensitivity for LC detection, with no single reagent outperforming the other, although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e> preferentially showed LC expression with pAbs </plain></SENT>
