<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We used a standardized electrophoresis protocol to identify differentially expressed proteins based on a sample pooling approach comparing three follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and three mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and seventy-five consistently differentially expressed proteins were identified out of more than 1600 protein spots per gel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these 175 protein spots, 38 of the 41 most highly expressed proteins were identified by MS analysis (MALDI-TOF), involving different cellular programs such as DNA repair (Rad50), cell cycle control (Mad1L1), transcription (SAFB), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (Luca-15 protein) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression data were confirmed by Western blot analysis of identified proteins and 2-D gel hybridization of proteins with known overexpression (G1/S-specific cyclin-D1, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> regulator Bcl-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison of proteome analysis to <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> expression array data revealed only a modest correlation of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and protein level emphasizing the relevance of post-translational regulation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> (p = 0.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most interestingly, additional data bank search identified 13 out of 17 referenced proteins (76%) as members of a TP53-dependent network of cell regulation </plain></SENT>
