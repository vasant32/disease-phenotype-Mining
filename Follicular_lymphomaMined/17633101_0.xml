<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The initial diagnosis and management of these complications are often difficult in PSIL, because the small intestine is usually inaccessible in routine endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, total enteroscopy with a double-balloon method, called double balloon endoscopy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBE</z:chebi>), has been developed for the diagnosis and treatment of small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report herein on 4 cases of PSIL (2 diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 2 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> [FLs]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these cases, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBE</z:chebi> was useful in the diagnosis, decision to perform surgery after assessment of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> lesion, and treatment of the intestinal stenosis using enteroscopic balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combination chemotherapy consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> with rituximab was administered in 3 cases, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> achieved complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient with FL of the duodenum was treated with rituximab alone, but with little effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBE</z:chebi> is useful in the management of PSIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More PSIL cases must be analyzed to establish the optimal management of patients with this form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
