<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TNFRSF5 and TNFSF5 encoding the CD40 and CD154 proteins, respectively, influence <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> risk, particularly a functional TNFRSF5 SNP (-1C&gt;T, rs1883832) associated with reduced B-cell CD40 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TNFRSF5 and TNFSF5 SNPs were examined in a population-based case-control study of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (376 cases/801 controls with DNA), and compelling findings were followed up in 2 independent populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pooled analyses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 case-control studies (total N = 1776 non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases, N = 2482 controls) revealed an increased risk of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) associated with the TNFRSF5 -1TT genotype (odds ratio = 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, among women, an inverse association was found between the variant A allele for a TNFSF5 6809G&gt;A SNP and FL risk (OR = .61; 95% CI, 0.36-0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In genotype-phenotype studies, significantly reduced circulating soluble CD40 was observed in TNFRSF5 -1TT compared with -1CC carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, dendritic cells from those with -1TT versus -1CC genotypes exhibited lower CD40 cell surface expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the TNFRSF5 -1C&gt;T polymorphism may increase FL susceptibility through mechanisms that hinder cellular immune responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to explore these findings </plain></SENT>
