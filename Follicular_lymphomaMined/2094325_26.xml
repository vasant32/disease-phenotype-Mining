<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A prospective cytogenetic study of patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) presenting to one institution was commenced in 1983 as part of a larger study including histology, immunophenotyping, cytokinetics and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>175 patients were studied over 5 years and G-banded karyotypes were successfully obtained in 147 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chromosome abnormalities were detected in 135 cases (92%) with the commonest abnormality being t(14;18)(q32;q21) in 69 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other non-random translocations were much less frequent, i.e. t(11;14) in seven cases and t(8;14) in four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other specific structural changes included partial deletions of 6q (breakpoints ranging within q13-q23), 3q (breakpoints ranging within q21-q27), 1q and 10q22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromosome regions highlighted as being frequently involved in structural abnormalities were 11q13-q25, 1p22-p36, 3q21-q27 and 6q13-q23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several specific recurring breakpoints were identified and these included 14q32, 18q21, 1p36 and 6q21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Frequently occurring numerical abnormalities were gains of chromosomes 3, 7, X and 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Correlation with histological type showed, as expected, that t(14;18) was present in 89% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but also occurred in 30% of diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities of 11q were correlated with the diffuse histologies as a group, whereas both numerical and structural abnormalities of chromosome 3 correlated with the diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL) subtype, and t(11;14) with diffuse small cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DSCCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although not statistically significant, abnormalities of 6q occurred twice as frequently in DLCL than in any other variety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, several other commonly occurring abnormalities, such as extra copies of chromosomes 7, X, 12 and most of the structural abnormalities of 1p, did not correlate with any histological type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore this large cytogenetic study has confirmed some previously reported correlations between specific chromosome abnormalities and histological subtypes of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and has also identified some new correlations which may prove useful in the investigation of the biological basis of the disease </plain></SENT>
