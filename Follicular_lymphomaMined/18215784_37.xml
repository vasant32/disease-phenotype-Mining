<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared traditional myeloablative conditioning regimens to RIC in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcomes of HLA-identical sibling HSCT for FL in 208 recipients reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) between 1997 and 2002 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conditioning regimens were categorized as myeloablative (N = 120) or RIC (N = 88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Use of RIC regimens increased from &lt;10% of transplants in 1997 to &gt;80% in 2002 signaling a major shift in practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving RIC were older and had a longer interval from diagnosis to transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These differences did not correlate with outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up of survivors was 50 months (4-96 months) after myeloablative conditioning versus 35 months (4-82 months) after RIC (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 3 years, overall survival (OS) for the myeloablative and RIC cohorts were 71 (63%-79%) and 62 (51%-72%; P = .15) and progression free survival (PFS), 67 (58%-75%) and 55 (44%-65%; P = .07), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lower Karnofsky performance score (KPS) and resistance to chemotherapy were associated with higher treatment-related mortality (TRM) and lower OS and PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> progression after RIC was observed (relative risk = 2.97, P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RIC has become the de facto standard in allogeneic HSCT for FL, and appears to result in similar long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although disease-free survival (DPS) is similar compared to myeloablative conditioning, an increased risk of late disease progression after RIC is concerning </plain></SENT>
