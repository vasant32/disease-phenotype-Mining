<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Breast involvement by non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is particularly rare in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the case of a patient with a rapidly growing, painless <z:hpo ids='HP_0000771'>gynecomastia</z:hpo>-like nodule in the left breast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On ultrasonography, the nodule was suspicious for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A breast biopsy from a 54-year-old Caucasian man showed the morphoimmunophenotypical features of grade 3 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed a t(14,18) translocation suggesting breast involvement by a systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> rather than a primary breast <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The histological diagnosis was subsequently confirmed after nodule excision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mediastinal and abdominal node involvement was then identified on computed tomography and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography scans during staging examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our patient was treated with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After three years our patient experienced a right retro-areolar relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>He then received two further cycles of chemotherapy but developed a myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and, as a result of this, he subsequently died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rarity of breast <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, especially in men, and the problems related to the therapeutic choices with these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> require molecular techniques in association with classical histological diagnosis </plain></SENT>
