<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 150-bp bcl-2 Mbr, which contains three breakage hotspots (peaks), has a single-stranded character and, hence, a non-B DNA conformation both in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we use gel assays and electron microscopy to show that a triplex-specific antibody binds to the bcl-2 Mbr in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">Bisulfite</z:chebi> reactivity shows that the non-B DNA structure is favored by, but not dependent upon, supercoiling and suggests a possible triplex conformation at one portion of the Mbr (peak I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have used circular dichroism to test whether the predicted third strand of that suggested structure can indeed form a triplex with the duplex at peak I, and it does so with 1:1 stoichiometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using an intracellular minichromosomal assay, we show that the non-B DNA structure formation is critical for the breakage at the bcl-2 Mbr, because a 3-bp mutation that disrupts the putative peak I triplex also markedly reduces the recombination of the Mbr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A three-dimensional model of such a triplex is consistent with bond length, bond angle, and energetic restrictions (stacking and hydrogen bonding) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We infer that an imperfect <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi> (R.R.Y) triplex likely forms at the bcl-2 Mbr in vitro, and in vivo recombination data favor this as the major DNA conformation in vivo as well </plain></SENT>
