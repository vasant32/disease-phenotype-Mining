<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2 gene is translocated into the Ig loci in about 80% of human follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and in 10% of B-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo> (B-CLL), resulting in a high level of expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have compared the expression of bcl-2 transcripts and protein in B-CLL cells in their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> equivalent CD5+ B cells and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cell populations representative of different in vivo and in vitro stages of activation and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here that bcl-2 was expressed in 11 of 11 cases of CD5+ B-CLL clones, contrasting with the absent expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD5+ B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activation of 173 and 183 B-CLL cells by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol esters</z:chebi> (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> [<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>]) to IgM secretion without concomitant DNA synthesis resulted in a rapid but transient downregulation of bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the reduction of bcl-2 at both the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> and protein levels was sustained after mitogenic stimulation, suggesting that bcl-2 expression and proliferation are inversely related in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This notion was further supported by immunocytochemical analysis showing that bcl-2 was primarily expressed in small resting lymphocytes and in cells differentiating to the plasma cell stage, but less expressed in Ki67-positive proliferating B blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it was also supported by the low level of bcl-2 in exponentially growing Epstein-Barr virus-carrying lymphoblastoid and B-CLL cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The regulation of bcl-2 expression in B-CLL resembled that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tonsillar follicular B cells, in which a high level of expression was found in resting mantle zone B cells but not in the proliferating germinal center B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings and the role of bcl-2 in maintaining B-cell memory, we propose that the phenotype of B-CLL cells corresponds to a mantle zone memory-type B cell </plain></SENT>
