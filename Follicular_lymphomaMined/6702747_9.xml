<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency and distribution of Leu 7+ cells in 14 reactive lymphoid tissues and 47 malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were studied using the frozen section immunoperoxidase technic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In reactive lymphoid tissues, Leu 7+ cells were concentrated in the pale zone of germinal centers and usually were relatively scarce in the interfollicular areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> most consistently had numerous admixed Leu 7+ cells and lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> the least </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors' findings suggest that Leu 7+ cell accumulation in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic lymphoid tissue is associated at least in part with something shared by the pale zone of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> germinal centers and the presence of neoplastic germinal centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This association does not appear to be a simple response to lymphoid proliferation </plain></SENT>
