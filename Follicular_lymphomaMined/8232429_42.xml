<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 1986, we designed a clinical trial to evaluate the benefit of concomitant administration of recombinant interferon alfa with a regimen containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> in patients with follicular non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The trial involved 242 patients with advanced low-grade follicular non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> selected on the basis of clinical, radiographic, and biologic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with a regimen consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, teniposide, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHVP), given monthly for six cycles and then every two months for one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After randomization, 123 patients also received interferon alfa-2b at a dosage of 5 million units three times weekly for 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining 119 patients received chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As compared with the patients treated with CHVP only, the patients treated with CHVP plus interferon alfa had a higher overall rate of response (85 percent vs. 69 percent, P = 0.006), a longer median event-free survival (34 months vs. 19 months, P &lt; 0.001), and a higher rate of survival at 3 years (86 percent vs. 69 percent, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte toxicity was greater in the patients treated with CHVP plus interferon alfa than in those treated with CHVP alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interferon alfa had to be stopped because of toxic effects (<z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>) in 13 patients (11 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The addition of interferon alfa to a regimen containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> increased the rate of response, event-free survival, and overall survival in patients with advanced follicular non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, without serious toxicity, although some patients were unable to tolerate the side effects </plain></SENT>
