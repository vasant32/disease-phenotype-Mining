<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether analyzing numbers of t(14;18)-positive cells in peripheral blood correlated with remission status in individual patients receiving a variety of treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Numbers of circulating t(14;18)-positive cells were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disease parameters and response to treatment were related to the pre- and post-treatment numbers of circulating t(14;18)-positive cells for 53 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these 53 patients, 70 treatment episodes were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A content of more than 328 t(14;18)-positive cells per 75,000 cells prior to therapy correlated with the more advanced stage IV disease ( P=0.01), bone marrow involvement ( P&lt;0.01), and overt leukemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> ( P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therapy episodes that cleared circulation from t(14;18)-positive cells with more than one log resulted in a significantly longer progression-free survival than treatment episodes with less than one log decline (26 versus 12 months, respectively) ( P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After first-line treatment episodes, numbers of circulating t(14;18)-positive cells declined in fairly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, irrespective of the clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, for second or later lines of treatment, declining numbers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells correlated with a clinical remission, whereas increasing numbers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were associated with clinically stable or progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From this, we conclude that quantitation of circulating t(14;18)-positive cells in peripheral blood is of only limited clinical significance in predicting treatment efficacy for the individual follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patient </plain></SENT>
