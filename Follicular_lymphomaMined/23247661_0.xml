<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Many patients with aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and high clinical risk score still die of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> after conventional R-CHOP chemoimmunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that intensified chemoimmunotherapy including systemic central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) prophylaxis improves outcome and reduces the incidence of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>-related events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Inclusion criteria were age 18-65 years, primary diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or grade III follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> without clinical signs of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease and negative cerebrospinal fluid cytology, age-adjusted International Prognostic Index 2-3 and WHO performance score 0-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of six courses of R-CHOEP-14 followed by a course of high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> and a course of high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary end point was failure-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e>) at 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 156 eligible patients with a median age of 54 years (range 20-64) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three-year overall survival (OS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> rates (median observation time 52 months for survivors) were 81% and 65%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven patients experienced <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> relapse, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> within 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results are promising with favorable 3-year OS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> rates, a low toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate and a lower than expected number of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> progression might be further reduced by earlier <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
