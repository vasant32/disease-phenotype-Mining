<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This retrospective analysis is focused on the efficacy and safety of radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with ZevalinÂ® in nine patients with recurrent follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) who were treated in a consolidation setting after having achieved complete remission or partial remission with FCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The median age was 63 yrs (range 46-77), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were relapsed with histologically confirmed CD20-positive (grade 1 or 2) FL, at relapse they received FCR every 28 days: F (25 mg/m2x 3 days), C (1 gr/m2 day 1) and R (375 mg/m2 day 4) for 4 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Who achieved at least a partial remission, with &lt; 25% bone marrow involvement, was treated with 90Yttrium Ibritumomab Tiuxetan 11.1 or 14.8 MBq/Kg up to a maximum dose 1184 MBq, at 3 months after the completion of FCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients underwent a further restaging at 12 weeks after 90Y-RIT with total body CT scan, FDG-PET/CT and bilateral bone marrow biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine patients have completed the treatment: FCR followed by 90Y-RIT (6 patients at 14.8 MBq/Kg, 3 patients at 11.1 MBq/Kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After FCR 7 patients obtained CR and 2 PR; after 90Y-RIT two patients in PR converted to CR 12 weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With median follow up of 34 months (range 13-50) the current analysis has shown that overall survival (OS) is 89% at 2 years, 76% at 3 years and 61% at 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were hematologic, one patient developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">herpes zoster infection</z:e> after 8 months following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35854">valacyclovir</z:chebi> discontinuation; another patient developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our experience indicate feasibility, tolerability and efficacy of FCR regimen followed by 90Y-RIT in patients relapsed with grades 1 and 2 FL with no unexpected toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A longer follow up and a larger number of patients with relapsed grades 1 and 2 FL are required to determine the impact of this regimen on long-term duration of response and PFS </plain></SENT>
