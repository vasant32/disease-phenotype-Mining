<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present studies on the application of molecular diagnosis in malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, a part of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL), often involve a t (14;18) chromosomal translocation, it is difficult to detect the translocation in some cases by conventional chromosomal analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We showed the usefulness of amplification of mbr/JH and mcr/JH junction by PCR to detect the translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PCR products of mbr/JH junction were positive in 7 out of 8 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> some of which were negative in tests on the translocation in the malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, most NHL do not have cytogenetically specific translocations, indicating the necessity for another way to diagnose the malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We used IgH gene probes as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specific markers in B-cell lineage malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We determined DNA sequences for complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of IgH in the malignant clone of each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Then, we prepared a unique 5' primer for PCR or an oligonucleotide probe for detecting the clone-specific VH gene in each case, amplified the DNA by PCR and finally tried to detect minimal disease in bone marrow or peripheral blood, which brought into sequential detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> in NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, molecular diagnosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancy</z:e> will be more important in diagnosis, staging, and clinical management of patients with NHL </plain></SENT>
