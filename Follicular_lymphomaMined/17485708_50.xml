<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To study the clinical significance of transformation to diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1972 to 1999, 325 patients were diagnosed with FL at St Bartholomew's Hospital (London, United Kingdom) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 15 years, progression occurred in 186 patients and biopsy-proven transformation in 88 of the 325 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall repeat biopsy rate was 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The risk of histologic transformation (HT) by 10 years was 28%, HT not yet having been observed after 16.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk was higher in patients with advanced stage (P = .02), high-risk Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI; P = .01), and International Prognostic Index (IPI; P = .04) scores at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expectant management (as opposed to treatment being initiated at diagnosis) also predicted for a higher risk of HT (P = .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Older age (P = .005), low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level (P = .03), high <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (P &lt; .0001), and high-risk FLIPI (P = .01) or IPI (P = .003) score at the time of first recurrence were associated with the diagnosis of HT in a biopsy performed at that time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median survival from transformation was 1.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with HT had a shorter overall survival (P &lt; .0001) and a shorter survival from progression (P &lt; .0001) than did those in whom it was not diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Advanced stage and high-risk FLIPI and IPI scores at diagnosis correlate with an increased risk of HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This event strongly influences the outcome of patients with FL by shortening their survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There may be a subgroup of patients in whom HT does not occur </plain></SENT>
