<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Compared with those with BMI less than 25 kg/m(2), women with BMI more than or equal to 25 kg/m(2) had 50% to 90% increased risk of NHL among women who carried IFNGR2 (rs9808753) AA, IL5 (rs2069812) CT/TT, IL7R (rs1494555) AA, and TNF (rs1799724) CC genotypes, but no increased risk among women with IFNGR2 AG/GG, IL5 CC, IL7R AG/GG, and TNF CT/TT genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significant interaction with BMI was only observed for IFNGR2 (rs9808753 P(forinteraction) = .034) and IL7R (rs1494555 P(forinteraction) = .016) for NHL overall; IL7R (rs1494555 P(forinteraction) = .016) and TNF (1799724 P(forinteraction) = .031) for B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; and IL5 (rs2069812 P(forinteraction) = .034) for T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After stratification by common B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes, a significant interaction was observed for IFNGR2 (rs9808753 P(forinteraction) = .006), IL13 (rs20541 P(forinteraction) = .019), and IL7R (rs1494555 P(forinteraction) = .012) for marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; IL7R (rs1494555 P(forinteraction) = .017) for small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>; and IL12A (rs568408 P(forinteraction) = .013) and TNF (1799724 P(forinteraction) = .04) for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that common genetic variation in Th1/Th2 pathway genes may modify the association between BMI and NHL risk </plain></SENT>
