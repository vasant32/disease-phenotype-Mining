<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cases selected were nodal NHL of neck (17 cases), submandibular (10 cases), inguinal (9 cases), and abdominal cavity (22 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in age distribution were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A slight female preponderance was present in cases with inguinal NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histologic and immunohistologic findings showed that nodal NHL were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>; (1) T-cell type was frequent in the neck but exceptional in other sites, (2) frequency of high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> was much higher in the intra-abdominal cavity but low in other sites, and (3) follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was common in the submandibular and inguinal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Previous studies indicated that histologic and/or immunologic types of NHL correlated with pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; EB virus and HTLV-1 for B and T <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e>, respectively, and acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>) for development of high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present results may provide an insight to consider as a possible pathogenesis of NHL </plain></SENT>
