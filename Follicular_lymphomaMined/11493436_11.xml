<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of quantitating circulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells by real-time PCR is reported in patients on first-line treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four consecutive patients with previously untreated follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and detectable t(14;18)-positive cells in pretreatment peripheral blood samples were monitored </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before and after induction therapy, blood samples were taken for quantitative analysis of t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At presentation, a median of 262 t(14;18)-positive cells per 75,000 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells was found (range, 1-75 000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with lower numbers of circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells more frequently had bulky disease (P =.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine percent of the patients responded clinically to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 22 of 28 patients, including 4 patients in whom treatment had failed clinically, the number of circulating t(14;18)-positive cells decreased to undetectable or low levels after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the remaining responding patients, circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells persisted after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These quantitative data on circulating t(14;18)-positive cells call into question the usefulness of molecular monitoring of the blood in a group of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> uniformly treated with a noncurative first-line regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>T(14;18)-positive cells decreased in peripheral blood after treatment, irrespective of the clinical response </plain></SENT>
