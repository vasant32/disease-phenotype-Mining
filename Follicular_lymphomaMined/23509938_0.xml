<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The aim of this study was to analyse the immunophenotypic and molecular features of a large series of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, focusing in particular on atypical cases that fail to express CD10 and/or bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such cases present diagnostic pitfalls, especially with regard to the differential diagnosis from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> and marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we also included an immunohistochemical evaluation of stathmin, which is strongly expressed by germinal centre B cells, as a putative new marker for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, particularly those with an atypical phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Two hundred and five follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were investigated with immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The use of three distinct anti-bcl-2 antibodies together with CD10 expression data and FISH analysis for bcl-2 and bcl-6 rearrangements allowed subclassification of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> into four distinct subgroups: (i) CD10-positive/bcl-2-positive, (ii) CD10-positive/bcl-2-negative, (iii) CD10-negative/bcl-2-positive, and (iv) CD10-negative/bcl-2-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were bcl-6-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>STMN1 (stathmin) was shown to be helpful in diagnosing bcl-2-negative and/or CD10-negative follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and in their distinction from marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combined immunohistological and molecular analyses reveal that follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showing an atypical immunophenotypic and molecular profile exist, and we demonstrate that STMN1 represents a novel useful diagnostic marker for these </plain></SENT>
