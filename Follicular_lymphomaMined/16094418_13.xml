<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This cytogenetic analysis of a large cohort extends previous observations and allows the identification of new cytogenetic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities identified in more than 15% of patients included +3/+3q (37%), 7q deletions (31%), +18/+18q (28%), 6q deletions (19%), +12/+12q (15%) and 8p deletions (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 3/3q, 7q deletions, +18 and +12 were seen in different combinations in more than 30% of patients in comparison to 2% in lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo>, 1% in mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 7% in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The marked propensity of these abnormalities to be recurrently associated with the same tumoral clone of individual karyotypes allowed the delineation of a cytogenetic profile that may help to distinguish non-MALT <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> among other mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If +3/3q, +12/+12q, and 6q, 7q and 8p deletions were significantly associated with clinical prognostic factors previously reported to influence survival and time to progression, patients displaying these abnormalities did not experience a significantly shorter time to progression </plain></SENT>
