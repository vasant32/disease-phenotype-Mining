<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To describe the effects of allo-HCT on the course of MS in a 49-year-old woman with longstanding progressive MS who was treated with allo-HCT for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Non-myeloablative conditioning allo-HCT, examination for IgG oligoclonal bands and measurement of CXCL13 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Despite the disappearance of oligoclonal bands in CSF, disease progression and CSF <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that CXCL13 and MMP-9 detected in CSF may reflect ongoing, pathogenic immune activation even after the eradication of intrathecal IgG synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This suggests that progressive MS may depend more on innate than on adaptive immune activation </plain></SENT>
