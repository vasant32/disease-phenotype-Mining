<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CDK9 is a member of the CDC2-like family of kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its cyclin partners are members of the CYCLIN T family (T1, T2a, and T2b) and CYCLIN K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CDK9/CYCLIN T1 complex is very important in the differentiation programme of several cell types, controlling specific differentiation pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Limited data are available regarding the expression of CDK9/CYCLIN T1 in haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyse the expression of the CDK9/CYCLIN T1 complex in lymphoid tissue, in order to assess its role in B- and T-cell differentiation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CDK9/CYCLIN T1 expression was found by immunohistochemistry in precursor B and T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In peripheral lymphoid tissues, germinal centre cells and scattered B- and T-cell blasts in interfollicular areas expressed CDK9/CYCLIN T1, while mantle cells, plasma cells, and small resting T-lymphocytes displayed no expression of either molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CDK9/CYCLIN T1 expression therefore appears to be related to particular stages of lymphoid differentiation/activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CDK9 and CYCLIN T1 were highly expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> derived from precursor B and T cells, from germinal centre cells, such as follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and from activated T cells (ie anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells of classical Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> also showed strong nuclear staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large B-cell, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, among T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, showed a wide range of values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No expression of CDK9 or CYCLIN T1 was detected in mantle cell and marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level, an imbalance in the CDK9/CYCLIN T1 ratio was found in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with germinal centre phenotype, and in the cell lines of classical Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, in comparison with reactive lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the CDK9/CYCLIN T1 complex may affect the activation and differentiation programme of lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanism through which the CDK9/CYCLIN T1 complex is altered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> needs to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
