<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a pathologic study of 3 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with extensive Dutcher body formation in comparison with lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 3 cases, 1 showed a follicular growth pattern, whereas the other 2 cases demonstrated only a vague nodular appearance highlighted by immunohistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cells containing Dutcher bodies were counted at 25, 90, or 110 per high-power field in each case, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 2 cases, cells with Dutcher bodies were clustered in an intrafollicular distribution, a possible histopathologic clue for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin M κ was identified as the component of Dutcher bodies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 cases, implying a possible molecular basis for the formation of Dutcher bodies in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 cases had cytogenetic changes supporting the diagnosis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, including dual rearrangement of BCL2 and BCL6, rearrangement of BCL2 with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 3 (BCL6), and isolated BCL6 rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We emphasize immunohistochemical analyses with anti-κ/λ and anti-immunoglobulin heavy-chain isotypes to characterize Dutcher bodies and document clonality in addition to the routine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> workup and indicated cytogenetic studies in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with prominent Dutcher bodies </plain></SENT>
