<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we characterized splenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in an human T lymphotropic virus type-I (HTLV-I) endemic area of Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess the pattern of splenic involvement and evaluate prognosis, we reviewed 27 specimens consisting of 26 splenectomies and one necropsy, which were classified using REAL classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases were divided into primary splenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 11 patients and secondary in 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of primary splenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was 0.3% (11 of approximately 4,000 malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary splenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> included 7 diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLBL), 2 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL), and 1 each of splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e>) and anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gross examination showed two patterns of splenic involvement; solid type (formation of large nodular mass, n=16) and disseminated type (multiple nodules with diffuse infiltration but no large nodular formation, n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The type could not be determined in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most solid types were DLBL or FL, while <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> was of the disseminated type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but each 2 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> were of B lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Follow-up of 26 patients indicated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were still alive (range, 1-89 months) and 8 of 15 patients with secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> died due to the progression of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; the survival rate at 2 years was 50% in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No elevation of anti-HTLV-I antibody was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) showed no reactivity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, although a few small lymphocytes were positive for EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>Hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus was observed in 6 of 20 (30%) patients examined and 4 of 11 (36%) cases of primary splenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that patients with primary splenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> have a favorable prognosis after splenectomy </plain></SENT>
