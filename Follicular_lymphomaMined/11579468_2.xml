<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified a novel t(3;6)(q27;p21) in a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) with histologic evidence of transformation and, by cloning the translocation junction, determined that the SRP20 gene was the partner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this translocation, the 5' regulatory region of the BCL6 was substituted by a putative regulatory region of SRP20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previously, we hypothesized that substitution of BCL6 promoter by those of the partner genes that were constitutively expressed throughout B-cell development led to persistent and inappropriate expression of BCL6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined the expression pattern of SRP20 during B-cell development by Northern blot analysis of a panel of B-cell lines representing various stages of B-cell development and noted that SRP20 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was expressed throughout B-cell development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SRP20 gene plays an important role in regulation of pre-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> splicing, and is expressed specifically in lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study provides the first evidence of SRP20 gene rearrangement in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
