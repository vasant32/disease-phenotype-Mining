<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A dietary compound <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> hardwires to multiple cellular processes, with suppression of cell proliferation, induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> considered as the major mechanisms underlying its anticancer properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on our recent evidence that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> triggers cell demise in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) cells, we aimed to identify <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>-regulated genes of utmost importance for the treatment of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Large-scale gene-expression profiling was performed during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>-triggered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (8-36 hours) in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> HF4.9 cells using Sentrix Human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e>-6 BeadChips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression levels of selected differentially expressed genes were verified by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chemical inhibitor studies (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> and AMD3100) were performed to provide further insights into the functional significance of selected genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Comprehensive transcriptional response is associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> treatment in HF4.9 cells, including differential expression of genes encoding apoptotic signaling proteins, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> suppressors, transcription and splicing factors, proteins involved in regulation of cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, migration (e.g., CXCR4), lymphoid development, or B-cell activation (e.g. CD20), and others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CXCR4 downregulation was confirmed by both qRT-PCR and immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> induced downregulation of CXCR4 protein also in other FL cell lines, and similar effect was observed upon prolonged incubation with low concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AMD3100 (a selective CXCR4 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>) alone enhanced neither spontaneous nor serum-starvation-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 24 hours of treatment, but impaired long-term cell growth in a cell line-dependent fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first study showing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>-induced downregulation of CXCR4, and at attainable in vivo concentration of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26195">polyphenol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>-regulated genes identified herein, e.g., CD20, are also seemingly pertinent to the pathophysiology of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
