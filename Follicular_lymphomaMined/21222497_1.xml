<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This article reviews the use of intravenous rituximab in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), low-grade or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The addition of rituximab to fludarabine plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> significantly prolonged progression-free survival both in previously untreated patients with CLL and in those with relapsed or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278791" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">refractory CLL</z:e>, according to the results of two randomized, open-label, multicenter trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with previously untreated advanced follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the addition of rituximab to chemotherapy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> [CHOP]; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> [CVP]; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>; or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>) was generally associated with better outcomes than chemotherapy alone in randomized, multicenter trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a similarly designed trial, progression-free survival was significantly longer in previously untreated patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, other indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, or mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who received rituximab plus bendamustine than in those receiving rituximab plus CHOP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monotherapy with rituximab also demonstrated efficacy in patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, according to the results of noncomparative trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In terms of maintenance therapy, progression-free survival was significantly prolonged with rituximab maintenance therapy versus observation alone in patients with advanced indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who had not progressed following first-line therapy with CVP and in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who had responded to CHOP (with or without rituximab), according to the results of randomized, open-label, multicenter trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In four randomized, open-label, multicenter trials in younger or elderly patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, event-free survival, failure-free survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival were generally improved to a significant extent by the addition of rituximab to CHOP or CHOP-like chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intravenous rituximab was generally well tolerated in patients with CLL, low-grade or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, or diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, both as monotherapy and when administered in combination with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Infusion reactions were one of the most commonly occurring adverse events in patients receiving intravenous rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of pharmacoeconomic modeling analyses demonstrated that rituximab appears to be cost effective in patients with previously untreated follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> receiving rituximab maintenance therapy following treatment for relapsed or refractory disease, and in patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, rituximab remains a valuable therapy in patients with CLL, low-grade or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and, in a variety of treatment settings, represents the standard of care </plain></SENT>
