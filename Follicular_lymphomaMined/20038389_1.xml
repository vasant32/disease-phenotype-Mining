<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The appearance of monoclonal antibodies, and specifically, rituximab, has provided a new approach to treating non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to analyse whether this drug is used according to its package leaflet in clinical practice, evaluate the treatment's efficacy and determine its cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ambispective, observational single-centre study of medication use set up as a prescription evaluation for the indication of rituximab in a tertiary hospital between March 2003 and 31 December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 82 of the 221 patients who were treated (37.1 %) received the drug for a condition that does not appear in the package leaflet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>51.1 % and 27.5 % of response and progression were registered for approved diagnoses and 34.9 % and 47 % for non-approved diagnoses; the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 25.3 % and 41.5 % respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean cost per treatment episode was the highest for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (11,683 euro), whilst the highest treatment cost per patient was associated with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (15,940 euro) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: We found that the main cause of the high rate of non-compliance with the package leaflet is patient lack of response to standard treatments, together with clinical practice guides that support the use of rituximab for conditions other than those for which it is indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, most of the clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of rituximab for these unauthorized diagnostic profiles have poor methodology, are in phase II, are open studies, have low patient numbers, or in some cases, are not comparative </plain></SENT>
