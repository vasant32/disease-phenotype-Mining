<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We attempted to monitor t(14;18) in lymph nodes by ultrasound-guided fine needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspirations</z:hpo> (UG-FNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, we confirmed t(14;18) in 27/31 UG-FNAs of lymph nodes with fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in patients with advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In complete (CR) and molecular remission, there were repeated 18 UG-FNAs in 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five of 18 UG-FNA were technically unsuccessful and 6/18 samples contained <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite that, these patients had a better prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 7/7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspirations</z:hpo> in six patients, t(14;18) was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients are still in CR, even one of them remains in long lasting remission despite two consecutive evidences of t(14;18) in UG-FNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Another three of these patients relapsed a few months after UG-FNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study is proof of the principle of the detection of residual t(14;18) bearing cells in previously involved lymph nodes despite patients being in remission </plain></SENT>
