<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Most non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) subtypes occur more among men than women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since sex hormones may influence immune function, female hormones may be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the relationship between NHL subtypes and reproductive factors, findings from a UK population-based case-control study (1998-2003) are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Female cases (n = 389) and controls (n = 394) aged 16-69 reported their reproductive histories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed using unconditional logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No associations were found for age at menarche, parity, or age at first child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among postmenopausal women, hormone therapy (HT) users had risks of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) below one compared to non-users (OR = 0.7, 95% CI 0.5,1.2; OR = 0.6, 95% CI 0.4,1.0, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Estimates agree with other reports: meta-analyses gave pooled ORs of 0.8 (95% CI 0.6,0.9) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and 1.0 (95% CI 0.8,1.2) for FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our study, ORs decreased with years of HT use: less and more than 5 years being 0.9 (95% CI 0.5,1.5) and 0.6 (95% CI 0.3,1.1) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (p-trend = 0.22), and 0.8 (95% CI 0.4,1.4) and 0.4 (95% CI 0.2,0.9) for FL (p-trend = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For greater power to investigate the association of hormones with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, FL, and rarer NHL subtypes, pooling data through the International <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Epidemiology Consortium (InterLymph) is warranted </plain></SENT>
