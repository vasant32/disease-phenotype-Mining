<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hematologic toxicity has been considered a major consequence of CLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to analyze the patterns of hematologic recovery after CLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-three patients with Stage I-III follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were treated with CLI between January 1993 and February 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CLI consisted of irradiation to mantle, upper two-thirds of abdomen, and pelvic fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each field was treated to 30.0-30.6 grays (Gy) at 1.5-1.8 Gy per fraction, with a boost to 36.0-39.6 Gy at the same rate to the sites of macroscopic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A break of approximately 4 weeks was given after treatment of each field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients who were followed for a minimum of 1 year from the end of CLI form the basis of this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients had Stage I disease, 6 patients had Stage II disease, and 15 patients had Stage III disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The International Prognostic Index (IPI) for malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was 0 for 5 patients, 1 for 13 patients, and 2 for 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group performance status was 0 for 21 patients and 1 for 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median values for their pretreatment characteristics were as follows: age, 60 years (range, 34-73 years); height, 173 cm (range, 155-193 cm); weight, 79 kg (range, 57-107 kg); body surface area (BSA), 1.95 m(2) (range, 1.61-2.31 m(2)); bone marrow cellularity, 27%(range, 2-75%), platelet count, 233,000/mm(3) (range, 139,000-339,000/mm(3)), white blood cell (WBC) counts, 6400/mm(3) (range, 4200-10,900/mm(3)); and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, 14.5 mg/dL (range, 11.8 -16.6 mg/dL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The median duration of CLI was 159 days (range, 137-345 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The number of sites receiving a boost dose of &gt; or = 36.0 Gy was 0 sites in 1 patient, 1 site in 6 patients, 2 sites in 11 patients, 3 sites in 5 patients, and 4 sites in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The platelet, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, and WBC counts were followed every 3 months after completion of CLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These counts were normalized to the pretreatment counts for statistical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to investigate the correlations between patient factors and hematologic status at 1 year posttreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Pearson correlation analysis was used for the continuous factors (patient age, height, weight, BSA, bone marrow cellularity, and duration of CLI), and the Mann-Whitney test was used for categoric factors (IPI, gender, performance status, stage, number of sites receiving &gt; or = 36.0 Gy, and presence or absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was continued recovery, essentially approaching the pretreatment levels, over 3 years for platelet, WBC, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Factors that were associated significantly with normalized platelet counts at 1 year by univariate analyses were age (P = 0.015) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (P = 0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Age was the only significant factor by multivariate analyses, with older patients having lower platelet counts at 1 year posttreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>No factors were found that were associated significantly with 1-year normalized WBC or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels by either univariate or multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three of the hematologic components (platelets, WBC, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>) essentially recover after patients undergo CLI over a 3-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Older age was the only significant adverse factor that affected the platelet recovery, as detected by multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
