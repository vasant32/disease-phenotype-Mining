<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of patient 2 had lymphoepithelial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of patient 4, who had a history of typical FL, was composed of only monocytoid cells, suggesting secondary involvement of the monocytoid component of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of patients 1 and 2 had tiny follicles immunoreactive with CD10 and BCL-2, whereas samples from patients 3 and 4 were negative for CD10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis showed IGH/BCL2 fusion in three of the four <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (patients 1, 3, and 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis showed time- and site-dependent differences in FL characteristics in patients 2 and 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Identifying tiny CD10+/BCL-2+ neoplastic follicles, detecting IGH/BCL2 fusion by FISH, and considering a history of FL are crucial for diagnosing such exceptional cases of FL </plain></SENT>
