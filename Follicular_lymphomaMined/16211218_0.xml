<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our previous study demonstrated that CD29 and CD36 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were overexpressed in de novo CD5-positive diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (CD5+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e>) compared with CD5-negative (CD5-) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD29 was expressed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, and CD36 on microvascular endothels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we analyzed the clinicopathological significance of CD29 and microvascular CD36 (mvCD36) expression in many cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD29 and CD36 expression was examined by immunohistochemistry on frozen sections of 159 specimens, consisting of 120 cases of CD5-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, 14 cases of de novo CD5+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, 11 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 8 cases of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 6 cases of reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three cases of CD5- intravascular large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (IVLs) with hepatic intrasinusoidal infiltration were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD29+ and/or mvCD36+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> cases had significantly higher serum LDH levels compared with CD29- mvCD36- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of CD29+ and mvCD36+ cases, and the number of CD29+ or mvCD36+ cases, were significantly higher in de novo CD5+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> than in CD5- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of CD29 and mvCD36 expression were low in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and mvCD36 was negative in reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasias</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Liver biopsies of three IVL cases showed that CD29 was positive on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, and, that CD36 was expressed on hepatic sinusoids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study supports the notion that CD29 and/or mvCD36 expression manifests the aggressive feature of a subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> because of its correlation with high serum LDH levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CD29 and mvCD36 expression should be evaluated in relation to the intravascular growth pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
