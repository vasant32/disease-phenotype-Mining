<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated sonoporation as a method to transfect nucleic acids in suspension cells, including the human follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line RL and fresh human <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RL and CLL cells were exposed to continuous ultrasound waves (445 kHz) in the presence of either plasmid DNA coding for green fluorescent protein (GFP) or fluorescent siRNA directed against BCL2L1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transfection efficiency and cell viability were assessed using fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry analysis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Knock-down of target protein by siRNA was assessed by immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, sonoporation was used to stably transfect RL cells with a plasmid coding for luciferase (pGL3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These cells were then used for the non-invasive monitoring of <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> in immunodeficient <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sonoporation allows a highly efficient transfection of nucleic acid in suspension cells with a low rate of mortality, both in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell line and in fresh human leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It also allowed efficient transfection of BCL2L1 siRNA with efficient reduction of the target protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, ultrasound cavitation represents an efficient method for the transfection of cells in suspension, including fresh human leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
