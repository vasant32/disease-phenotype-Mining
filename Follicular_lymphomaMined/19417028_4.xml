<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Rituximab has greatly improved the efficacy of chemotherapy regimens for CD20-positive non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, although several mechanisms of action of rituximab have been identified, the exact therapeutic functions of these mechanisms remains to be clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, there is no established prognostic marker to predict an individual response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study verified the validity of ex vivo complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) susceptibility as a predictor of pathologic <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> in patients undergoing rituximab-containing chemotherapy and examined whether CDC contributes to the mechanism of action of rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A rapid assay system was established to evaluate the tumoricidal activity of rituximab using a living cell-imaging technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed lymph node biopsies obtained from 234 patients with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and estimated the association between CDC susceptibility and the response to rituximab-containing chemotherapy in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This study revealed that CDC susceptibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells freshly obtained from patients was strongly associated with response to rituximab-containing chemotherapy in both diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This correlation was not apparent in cases that received chemotherapy without rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The system that we have established allows a successful assessment of rituximab-induced CDC and can distinguish cases refractory to rituximab-containing chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association between CDC susceptibility and therapy response suggests that CDC is pivotal in the ability of chemotherapy including rituximab to induce remission </plain></SENT>
