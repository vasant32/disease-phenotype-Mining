<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recent findings suggest that ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure may reduce risk of developing non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), but the biologic basis for this relationship remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed data from our US population-based case-control study of NHL to investigate whether our previously reported inverse association with sun exposure was dependent upon variants in the <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> receptor gene (IVS10 + 283G &gt; A (BsmI), Ex11 + 32T &gt; C (TaqI)), and genes linked to UV-induced immune modulation (IL4, IL10, IL12A, IL12B, TNF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: UV exposure data was collected from an in-person interview with 551 cases and 462 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for sun exposure measures for joint variant-exposure effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The association with NHL risk for time in the midday sun within the last decade was dependent upon Ex11 + 32 T &gt; C genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to TT carriers who reported &lt; 7 h/week of sun exposure, CC subjects with &lt; 7 h/week of sun exposure had an increased risk of NHL (OR = 1.9, 95% CI 0.8-4.4, P(interaction) = 0.16), while the relative risks for other CC carriers approached unity with increasing level of sun exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This pattern of effects was especially apparent for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (for CC genotype and &lt; 7 h/week of exposure: OR 6.3, 95% CI 1.9-22, P(interaction) = 0.004), and was consistently observed across measures of reported sun exposure for different periods of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As IVS10 + 283G &gt; A is correlated with Ex11 + 32T &gt; C in our population (r (2) = 0.95), results were equivalent for those with the IVS10 + 283 AA genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No evidence of interaction with cytokine gene variants was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the inverse association between UV exposure and NHL risk may be mediated by the <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of this finding in other studies is warranted </plain></SENT>
