<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From September 1995 to January 2000, 39 patients with newly diagnosed (n = 31) or relapsed (n = 8) NHL were treated in our institution with myeloablative therapy followed by CD34(+) selected autologous PBPC transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients were diagnosed with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and eight patients with mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had advanced disease (26% of patients stage III and 74% stage IV, Ann Arbor classification) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Induction therapy resulted in a complete remission in 17 patients and a partial remission in 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PBPC were mobilized after cytotoxic chemotherapy with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD34(+) selection was performed using immunomagnetic beads (Baxter Isolex 300SA or 300i Magnetic Cell Separation System) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most patients (85%) received total body irradiation and high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> as myeloablative regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients also received rituximab 375 mg/m(2) before radiation and before the start of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean CD34(+) cell number for transplantation was 6.5 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg of body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Platelet recovery (&gt;20,000/microl median on day 13) and leukocyte recovery (&gt;1,000/microl median on day 12) were within expected range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The estimated median follow-up was 47 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The probabilities of freedom from progression, overall survival, and event-free survival 4 years after transplantation were 96%, 90%, and 87%, respectively, for patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 42%, 63%, and 33%, respectively, for patients with mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for relapse were age and extranodal manifestation of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The rate of lethal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in the 12-month follow-up period was 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We conclude that CD34(+) selection of autologous transplants following myeloablative therapy is feasible and results in long-term remission in the majority of patients, but the procedure is probably related to a higher rate of lethal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
