<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to the World Health Organization classification, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of follicular center cell origin are classified as either large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (LBCL) or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors tested the feasibility of performing gene expression profiling using amplified <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from fine-needle aspirates (FNA) obtained from lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four samples from patients with a diagnosis of FL or LBCL were obtained after Institutional Review Board-approved informed consent was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses were confirmed by 2 pathologists and were classified into 2 groups (10 LBCL samples and 14 FL samples) by using conventional <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunophenotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred nanograms of total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> were subjected to 2 cycles of standard, double-stranded complementary DNA synthesis and in vitro transcription for target amplification using a small-sample target-labeling protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The biotinylated cRNA from each sample was hybridized to gene chips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gene expression profiling results were analyzed first by principal-component analysis (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) by using a list of 146 probe sets that represented 62 genes that are characteristic of an activated B-cell (ABC) signature or a GC signature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The analysis identified 5 LBCL samples with an ABC cell signature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using a list of 207 probe sets that represented 113 genes involved in FL transformation, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> analysis identified 2 overlapping clusters corresponding to FL and GC-diffuse LBCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To improve this classification further, the authors generated a list of 72 genes that were expressed differentially between FL and GC-LBCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Using this list of genes, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> analysis demonstrated a clear separation between FL and GC-LBCL </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These samples were characterized morphologically by a mixed cell pattern with relatively fewer large, noncleaved lymphocytes and more small, cleaved lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The results support the feasibility of FNA-based transcription profiles in patients with FL or LBCL, which, in combination with <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunophenotyping, can help in the subtyping of these entities </plain></SENT>
