<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, multiple nodular lesions in the liver and small para-aortic nodes were detected by abdominal magnetic resonance imaging without <z:hpo ids='HP_0008940'>generalized lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After careful observation for three months, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> was observed in the right occipital, para-aortic, and bilateral inguinal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with R-CHOP (rituximab, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>) and achieved complete remission for more than 2 years </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insufficient cases have been reported to determine the long-term outcome and clinical characteristics of primary hepatic follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, it seems that patients with primary hepatic follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that are treated with appropriate chemotherapy with or without surgical resection have favorable outcomes </plain></SENT>
