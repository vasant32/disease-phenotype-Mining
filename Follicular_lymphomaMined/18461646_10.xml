<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> inducible factors (HIF) 1alpha and 2alpha, of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and of the phosphorylated form of its receptor VEGFR2 (pVEGFR2/KDR) were investigated immunohistochemically in a series of 146 B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 48 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These proteins were significantly up-regulated in neoplastic lymphocytes and a significantly higher expression of HIF1alpha (p = 0.05), VEGF (p = 0.02) and pVEGFR2/KDR (p = 0.007) was recorded in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>(<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) compared to follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A strong statistical association of pVEGFR2/KDR expression with high HIF1alpha, HIF2alpha and VEGF was noted in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HIF1alpha andHIF2alpha were linked with VEGF expression but no association between HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vascular density was significantly higher in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue, but there was no association with any of the examined parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the VEGF/receptor pathway is active in more than half of NHLs and particularly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intimate correlation of VEGF production with the presence of phosphorylated VEGF-receptors strongly supports the concept of an autocrine pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The strong association of HIFalphas with the expression of VEGF and pVEGFR2/KDR found in the study provide strong evidence on the role of HIFalphas inthe activation of angiogenic and VEGF-autocrine pathways that may be critical therapeutic targets for HIF-inhibitors or other anti-angiogenic agents </plain></SENT>
