<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the efficacy and safety of rituximab alone or combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in a phase 3 setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this multicentre phase 3 trial, rituximab-naive or rituximab-sensitive patients aged 18 years or older with relapsed grade 1 or 2 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive five 35-day cycles consisting of intravenous infusions of rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 1, and on day 1 of cycles 2-5, either alone or with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> 1·6 mg/m(2), administered by intravenous injection on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Randomisation was stratified by FLIPI score, previous use of rituximab, time since last therapy, and region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment assignment was based on a computer-generated randomisation schedule prepared by the sponsor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients and treating physicians were not masked to treatment allocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was progression-free survival analysed by intention to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This trial has been completed and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00312845 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Between April 10, 2006, and Aug 12, 2008, 676 patients were randomised to receive rituximab (n=340) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> plus rituximab (n=336) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 33·9 months (IQR 26·4-39·7), median progression-free survival was 11·0 months (95% CI 9·1-12·0) in the rituximab group and 12·8 months (11·5-15·0) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> plus rituximab group (hazard ratio 0·82, 95% CI 0·68-0·99; p=0·039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of clinical benefit was not as large as the anticipated prespecified improvement of 33% in progression-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients in both groups received a median of five treatment cycles (range 1-5); 245 of 339 (72%) and 237 of 334 (71%) patients in the rituximab and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> plus rituximab groups, respectively, completed five cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of patients who did not complete five cycles, most discontinued early because of disease progression (77 [23%] patients in the rituximab group, and 56 [17%] patients in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> plus rituximab group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Rates of adverse events of grade 3 or higher (70 [21%] of 339 rituximab-treated patients vs 152 [46%] of 334 bortezomib plus rituximab treated patients), and serious adverse events (37 [11%] patients vs 59 [18%] patients) were lower in the rituximab group than in the combination group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (15 [4%] patients in the rituximab group and 37 [11%] patients in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> plus rituximab group), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (15 [4%] patients and 36 [11%] patients, respectively), diarrhoea (no patients and 25 [7%] patients, respectively), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">herpes zoster</z:e> (one [&lt;1%] patient and 12 [4%] patients, respectively), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (two [&lt;1%] patients and 10 [3%] patients, respectively) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (two [&lt;1%] patients and 10 [3%] patients, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No individual serious adverse event was reported by more than three patients in the rituximab group; in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> plus rituximab group, only <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (seven patients [2%]) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>pyrexia</z:hpo> (six patients [2%]) were reported in more than five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> plus rituximab group 57 (17%) of 334 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> (including sensory, motor, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007141'>sensorimotor neuropathy</z:hpo>), including nine (3%) with grade 3 or higher, compared with three (1%) of 339 patients in the rituximab group (no events of grade ≥3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>No patients in the rituximab group but three (1%) patients in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> plus rituximab group died of adverse events considered at least possibly related to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Although a regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> plus rituximab is feasible, the improvement in progression-free survival provided by this regimen versus rituximab alone was not as great as expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The regimen might represent a useful addition to the armamentarium, particularly for some subgroups of patients </plain></SENT>
