<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The majority of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are associated with reciprocal translocations involving BCL2 and cMYC, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unusual reports of aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> presenting with both translocations have been described as well as rare cases with a third structural alteration usually involving BCL6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient described here presented with aggressive high-grade lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, FAB subtype L2 (ALL-L2), and three reciprocal translocations, t(14;18)(q32;q21), t(8;14)(q24.1;q32), and t(1;2) (q22-23;p13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite immature <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> the leukemic blasts had a mature B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp>; they were positive for surface immunoglobulin heavy chains and negative for CD34, TdT, and CD10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most reported dual t(14;18)/t(8;14) cases have not shown sIg and were positive for CD10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecular genetic analyses showed the typical rearrangements of BCL2 and cMYC as well as the FCGR2B gene on chromosome 1q23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of a third oncogene rearrangement in association with the dual BCL2, cMYC translocations in ALL patients is very rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first case where the third hit involves the FCGR2B locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This report reiterates the poor prognosis associated with activation of cMYC together with elevated Bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data also support recent evidence that dysregulation of FCGR2B may play a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
