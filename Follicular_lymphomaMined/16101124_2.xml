<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the detection rate varied greatly with the technique used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of IGH rearrangements was analyzed using several fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques on metaphases obtained from 57 patients with nodal NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An IGH rearrangement was identified in 42 cases (73.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A t(14;18)(q32;q21) was found in 17 of the 20 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (85%) studied and a t(11;14)(q13;q32) in 10 of the 11 mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (91%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IGH rearrangements were identified in 12 of the 26 diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (46%), including 5 t(14;18)(q32;q21) and 2 t(3;14)(q27;q32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conventional cytogenetics was uninformative in several cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the complemented analysis using Multi-FISH and/or chromosomal whole paint enabled the characterization of complex IGH translocations in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and the identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the chromosomal partners involved in the IGH rearrangement in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study shows the interest of using metaphase FISH in addition to conventional cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following banding techniques, FISH with the IGH dual color probe could be the first approach in NHL, after which chromosome painting and M-FISH could be used to identify the chromosomal partner involved in the IGH rearrangement </plain></SENT>
