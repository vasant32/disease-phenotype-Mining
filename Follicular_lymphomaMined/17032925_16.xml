<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined whether this correlation is related in any way to the chemotherapy response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with complete response (CR), the 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 69% for patients with antibody response and/or V/V genotype, while the PFS was only 40% for patients with neither; the median time to progression (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) was 10.47 versus 3.46 years (P=.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with partial response (PR), the 5-year PFS was 57% for patients with antibody response and/or V/V genotype, and 17% for patients with neither; the median <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> was not reached versus 1.31 years (P=.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study further confirms the strong association of clinical outcome with antibody response and with the functionally more active form of the Fc receptor in patients receiving idiotype vaccination regardless of their response to induction chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
