<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 57-year-old woman was referred to the Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine because of multiple polypoid lesions in the duodenum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the histopathologic findings, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had been diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The polypoid lesions did not show any improvement in spite of antimicrobial therapy for elimination of Helicobacter pylori </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because the disease remained stable during the clinical course, no other specific treatment was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis on a single-cell preparation obtained from the <z:mp ids='MP_0002580'>duodenal lesions</z:mp>, to assess the specific chromosome translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified BCL2/IGH fusion at a frequency of 83% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two-color FISH was also performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections, which demonstrated BCL2/IGH fusion-positive cells in neoplastic follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings, together with the CD10+ immunophenotyping of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, led to a diagnosis of primary follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the duodenum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interphase FISH with the IGH gene and oncogene probes is a rapid and powerful tool for assessing genomic changes in gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> on single-cell preparations and tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This technique is particularly useful in view of the increasingly small core biopsy samples and needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspirations</z:hpo> obtained for diagnostic purposes </plain></SENT>
