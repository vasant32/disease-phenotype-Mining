<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clonal ancestors of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were identified by this marker among bone marrow pre-B cells (5% to 26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A second antiidiotype (anti-Id) antibody specific for the complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> IgM kappa recognized 10% of B cells in bone marrow and blood and greater than 95% of B cells in lymphomatous lymph nodes, including one obtained after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> conversion to a diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> arose through a progression of transformational events beginning in bone marrow: first, creation of an oligoclonal pre-neoplastic pool of pre-B cells, subsequent conversion of a single subclone into low grade neoplastic B cells that homed to the lymph node follicles, and later progression to a more invasive form of the B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
