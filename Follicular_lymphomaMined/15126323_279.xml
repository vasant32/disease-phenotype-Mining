<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A validated prognostic index (PI) would help in evaluating and choosing these treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Characteristics at diagnosis were collected from 4167 patients with FL diagnosed between 1985 and 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to propose a PI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This index was then tested on 919 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five adverse prognostic factors were selected: age (&gt; 60 years vs &lt; or = 60 years), Ann Arbor stage (III-IV vs I-II), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level (&lt; 120 g/L vs &gt; or = 120 g/L), number of nodal areas (&gt; 4 vs &lt; or = 4), and serum LDH level (above <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vs <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or below) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three risk groups were defined: low risk (0-1 adverse factor, 36% of patients), intermediate risk (2 factors, 37% of patients, hazard ratio [HR] of 2.3), and poor risk (&gt; or = 3 adverse factors, 27% of patients, HR = 4.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) appeared more discriminant than the International Prognostic Index proposed for aggressive non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results were very similar in the confirmation group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The FLIPI may be used for improving treatment choices, comparing clinical trials, and designing studies to evaluate new treatments </plain></SENT>
