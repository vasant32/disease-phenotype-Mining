<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency distribution of low (less than or equal to 4%) and high (&gt; 4%) LI between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with nodular and diffuse histologic patterns was significantly different (P &lt; 0.001): The median LI was about four times greater for diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> than for nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LI was not correlated with either disease extent or systemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of low LI, complete remission occurred in 86% of those with modular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and in 74% of those with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These values were significantly different from the 17 and 39% observed respectively for nodular and diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with high LI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with low LI had greater actuarial 4-year survival than did those with high LI (P &lt; 10(-7)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Highly significant differences between the two kinetic groups were also observed within nodular and diffuse patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, whereas the difference for nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was independent of histologic subtype and stage, this was not always true for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes of diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LI could be a useful marker to identify prior to treatment the patients who could enter complete remission and have favorable survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Its clinical relevance as a prognostic factor appeared superior to the Rappaport histologic classification and pathologic stage, especially in patients with nodular histology </plain></SENT>
