<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical, morphological and immunohistochemical features of 37 archival cases of primary ocular adnexal lymphoproliferative lesions were studied including 5 cases of reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> and 32 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Classification of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were made according to the WHO classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were studied by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using dual color break apart probes of IgH, MALT1, bcl-6, c-Myc, bcl-2, CCND1, bcl-10, and FOXP1 for detection of chromosomal aberrations involving IgH, MALT1, bcl-6, c-Myc, bcl-2, cyclinD1, bcl-10 and FOXP1 genes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FISH with IgH / bcl-2 dual color dual fusion probe was used for detection of t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IgH-bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CEP18 spectrum orange probe was used for detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> of the chromosome 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 32 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 28 cases (87.5%) were extranodal marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), 2 cases were follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) and 2 cases diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 28 cases of MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, chromosomal aberrations were found in 60.7% (17/28) by interphase FISH analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One case showed positive IgH break-apart signal with unknown partner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>16 cases showed three copies of different genes, of which, three copies of MALT1, bcl-6, and c-Myc were identified in 7 cases (25%), 12 cases (43%), and 2 cases (8%) of MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, 5 cases showed two genes including three copies of bcl-6 and MALT1 in 4 cases, and three copies of bcl-6 together with c-Myc in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with three copies of MALT1 had <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>t(14;18)(q32;q21) was detected in both follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of the 2 DLBCL cases, one showed three copies of bcl-6 together with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 18 and the other one showed three copies of bcl-6 together with IgH and c-Myc rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal aberration was not found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 cases of reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The most common entity of primary ocular adnexal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and FISH is helpful for their differential diagnosis and classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 18 and three copies of bcl-6 are common chromosomal aberrations in primary ocular adnexal MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
