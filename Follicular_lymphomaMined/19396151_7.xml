<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although most follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are believed to be of nodal origin, they sometimes originate from the duodenum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have reported that the latter differ from nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in having lower clinical stages and uniformly low histological grades, along with variable region of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (VH) usage that is more similar to mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little is known, however, about whether they possess other characteristics of nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, particularly ongoing mutations with follicular dendritic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined 17 cases for which PCR identified the monoclonal bands of the immunoglobulin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The duodenal cases showed ongoing mutations, but they lacked activation-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminase (AID) expression, a statistically significant difference from the nodal cases (P&lt;0.001), and their follicular dendritic cell networks were disrupted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, not only were VH deviations observed but also they used very restricted VH genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanisms of ongoing mutation without AID and follicular dendritic cell were not clarified, restricted VH usage strongly suggested that antigen stimulation was involved, and that was similar to MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, duodenal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were shown to be unique, in that they had ongoing hypermutations such as nodal cases, but the mechanisms involved in the hypermutation were quite different; furthermore, restricted VH usage suggested a strong similarity to the antigen-dependent origin of MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
