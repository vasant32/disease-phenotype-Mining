<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Bcl-6 gene product, a nuclear phosphoprotein, is expressed independently of Bcl-6 gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In lymph nodes, expression of Bcl-6 protein is restricted to germinal center (GC) B-cells and 10% to 15% of CD3/CD4+ intrafollicular T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interfollicular cells are negative for Bcl-6 protein, except for rare CD3+/CD4+ T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, we reported cases of angioimmunoblastic T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (AITL) with hyperplastic GCs (AITL/GC), and observed that borders of enlarged GCs were ill defined, with features suggestive of an outward migration of GC cells to surrounding interfollicular zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This prompted a study of follicular borders with Bcl-6 staining in reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasias</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> to compare with AITL/GC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Formalin-fixed paraffin sections were used for immunostaining of Bcl-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six cases of AITL/GC, 12 nonspecific reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> (FH), 7 HIV <z:mp ids='MP_0000702'>adenopathy</z:mp>, 10 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), and 8 typical AITL (ie, AITL without GC) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Double staining for Bcl-6/CD20, Bcl-6/CD3, and Bcl-6/CD57 was performed in selected cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In FH and HIV <z:mp ids='MP_0000702'>adenopathy</z:mp>, staining for Bcl-6 revealed densely populated GCs with well-defined and regular GC borders, whereas Bcl-6+ cells were rare in the interfollicular areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An occasional GC with an ill-defined border was invariably surrounded by a broad mantle zone; those with indistinct mantle zones had well-defined, regular borders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In FL, follicles were densely populated, and their borders were irregular, with some Bcl-6+ cells in the interfollicular zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In AITL/GC, GCs were less dense, GC borders were ill defined and irregular, and the number of interfollicular Bcl-6+ cells was markedly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Double staining revealed that these interfollicular Bcl-6+ cells in AITL/GC were Bcl6+/CD3+/CD20-/CD57- T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, CD3+ intrafollicular T cells were depleted in AITL/GC, whereas they were abundant in FH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Intrafollicular CD57+ cells did not stain for Bcl-6, and were also depleted in AITL/GC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In typical AITL, some neoplastic cells were positive for Bcl-6, showing variable degrees of staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: (1) GCs of AITL/GC differed from those of other reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasias</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and staining for Bcl-6 was useful to discern them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>(2) Intrafollicular CD3+ T cells, many of which were also positive for Bcl-6, were markedly depleted in AITL/GC, with increased interfollicular Bcl-6+/CD3+ cells, suggesting an outward migration of intrafollicular T cells in this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>(3) Interfollicular Bcl-6+/CD3+ cells in AITL/GC were too numerous to be accounted for by migration alone, suggesting local proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>(4) Intrafollicular CD57+ cells were negative for Bcl-6, indicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the intrafollicular T-cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>(5) Some neoplastic cells in AITL stained for Bcl-6, suggesting up-regulation of Bcl-6 expression in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
