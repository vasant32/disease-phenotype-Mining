<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen mutations were found in 13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> specimens, as follows: 8 of 120 (6.7%) mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 4 of 42 (9.5%) follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and 1 of 23 (4.3%) diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High-grade MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tended to show a slightly higher mutation frequency (2 of 25, 8%) than low-grade MALT <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (6 of 95, 6.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among low-grade gastric MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mutations were found in 3 of 11 tumors that did not respond to Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy, but none were found in 22 tumors that regressed completely after H pylori eradication </plain></SENT>
