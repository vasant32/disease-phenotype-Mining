<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These specimens were studied by histologic, immunoperoxidase (for immunoglobulins, intermediate filaments (IF), actin and neuron-specific enolase), immunofluorescence (for immunoglobulins, and with a panel of monoclonal antibodies), and electron-microscopic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rosettes were formed by neoplastic lymphocytes arranged around eosinophilic fibrillary material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructurally, this was composed of cytoplasmic processes, projecting from the lymphocytes and containing thin and intermediate filaments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, it stained for monoclonal IgM lambda, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other antigens present on the neoplastic cells, and weakly for vimentin and actin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on recent information about lymphocyte surface changes, it is speculated that the rosettes might represent an aggregation of neoplastic lymphocytes activated by a microenvironmental stimulus, perhaps antigen-antibody binding at the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The practical implication of this hitherto unreported finding is that the presence of rosettes cannot be used to rule out a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
