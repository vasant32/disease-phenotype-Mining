<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the ampulla of Vater are extremely rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among these most frequent are follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> followed by mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 36-year-old female diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) of the ampulla of Vater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic biopsy was non-diagnostic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whipple's resection was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient was given six cycles of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One year later, the patient developed recurrence at the anastomotic site and again treated with combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient is doing well after 2 years of initial surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0345916" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors of the ampulla of Vater</z:e> are included in the pancreaticobiliary group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>; in some instances, it is almost impossible to ascertain the exact origin of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> anatomically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the ampulla of Vater may have a varied clinical presentation or may be completely asymptomatic and detected during routine medical check-ups for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We present a rare case of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> of the periampullary region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Due to the rarity of these lesions, their ability to masquerade as periampullary <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, and the fact that these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> show a good response to chemotherapy, an early diagnosis is desirable </plain></SENT>
