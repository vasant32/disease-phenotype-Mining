<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This form of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> presumably is composed of neoplastic B lymphocytes, which produce intracellular immunoglobulins or fractions thereof, corresponding to various cellular vacuoles and inclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The vacuolated appearance of the neoplastic cells simulates mucinous or "signet ring" <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, which may be excluded by clinical, routine microscopic, histochemical, immunologic, and electron microscopic observations </plain></SENT>
