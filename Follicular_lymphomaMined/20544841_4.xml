<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to the t(14;18), eight unique balanced translocations were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Commonly reported FL-associated copy number regions were revealed including losses of 1p32-36, 6q, and 10q, and gains of 1q, 6p, 7, 12, 18, and X </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most frequent regions affected by copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity were 1p36.33 (28%), 6p21.3 (20%), 12q21.2-q24.33 (16%), and 16p13.3 (24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also identified by SNP analysis, 45 aberrant regions that each affected one gene, including CDKN2A, CDKN2B, FHIT, KIT, PEX14, and PTPRD, which were associated with canonical pathways involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study illustrates the power of using complementary high-resolution platforms on paired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> specimens and computational analysis to provide potential insights into the significance of single-gene somatic aberrations in FL <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
