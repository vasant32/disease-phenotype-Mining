<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> circulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells can be detected by quantitative real-time PCR with a high sensitivity and reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With this study we wanted to ascertain whether a continuous molecular remission achieved in patients with mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has an impact on survival of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENT AND METHODS: We conducted these investigations in 32 patients (24 with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 8 with mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) who were treated in a randomized trial with chemotherapy plus/minus rituximab (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>, R-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A further ten patients had follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (stage I and II) in long-term complete remission after radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Up to 18 years after initial diagnoses of a stage I or II follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> circulating t(14;18) positive cells could be detected in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In advanced stage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients molecular remissions could only be achieved when they were treated with combined chemo-immunotherapy (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>+R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher relapse-free survival correlates with sustained molecular remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the frustrating clinical results obtained from the treatment of patients with mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> corresponded to an achievement of only short molecular remissions in very few patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The consequent application of quantitative real-time PCR will further improve current treatment strategies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Especially, individual treatment options can be developed for patients who do not respond to a standard chemotherapy or progression of disease is recognized, if results of molecular monitoring will be confirmed in large prospective studies </plain></SENT>
