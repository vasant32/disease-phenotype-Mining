<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we estimate the effectiveness of chemotherapy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>) including rituximab for them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen consecutive patients who were diagnosed of having FL in the duodenum between July 2005 and September 2008 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were given the conventional staging examinations, including total enteroscopy using <z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBE</z:chebi> and/or VCE procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy was performed after written informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Response assessment was performed every 6-12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up period was 30.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FL was diagnosed in each patient as low grade (grade 1, n = 7; 2, n = 6) and, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 4 patients, localized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (stage I, n = 8; II(1), n = 1; II(2), n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBE</z:chebi> revealed multifocal lesions in the jejunum in 10 of the patients, and in the ileum in 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>VCE showed similar findings in the jejunum in the recent 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 13 patients finally received chemotherapy, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them achieved complete regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>They showed no evidence of recurrence after that </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Total examination of the small intestine using <z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBE</z:chebi> should be performed before treatment to choose a suitable treatment procedure for primary FL of the GI tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, VCE is useful for screening and following the small intestine in the patients with it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy is effective to achieve complete regression of primary FL of the GI tract </plain></SENT>
