<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Peanut agglutinin (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi>) receptors were studied in 37 cases of reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> and 66 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, using the unlabeled peroxidase-antiperoxidase (<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>) method on paraffin embedded material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on the binding sites of the lectin, positively stained cells were easily recognized as either cytoplasmic receptor-positive (CR+) or surface receptor-positive (SR+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the lymph node specimens, CR+ cells corresponded to macrophage-histiocytes and possibly dendritic reticulum cells; SR+ cells corresponded to lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three categories of CR+ cells were noted: large, medium, and small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The large CR+ cells were present in most germinal centers from reactive nodes, but were virtually absent in neoplastic follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Varying numbers of medium and small CR+ cells were seen in reactive as well as neoplastic follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SR+ cells were present in both follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (64%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> (19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In neoplastic follicles, SR+ cells were distributed uniformly throughout every follicle in the node revealing no relation to the orientation of the node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In reactive follicles, however, the occurrence of SR+ cells was not only infrequent, but also focal, and was often associated with the polarity of the follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The uniform distribution of SR+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells produced a characteristic staining pattern of neoplastic follicles which, along with the disappearance of the large CR+ cells, would provide an additional feature useful in the differential diagnosis of neoplastic from reactive follicles </plain></SENT>
