<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a new class of molecular lesions in the 5' region of the BCL2 protooncogene when it undergoes a t(14;18) translocation-associated rearrangement in the major break cluster (MBR) or minor break cluster (MCR) regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among 52 tumors assayed for BCL2 rearrangements using the MBR, MCR, and 5' probes, seven (six with MBR and one with MCR translocation breaks) showed aberrant bands in unique enzyme digests of DNA hybridized with the 5' probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aberrant bands in four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were in HindIII digests, in two they were in EcoRI digests, while the aberrant band in one was in a BamHI digest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two EcoRI bands and two of the four HindIII bands were of identical sizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Germline polymorphisms as the source of these bands was ruled out by appropriate control experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the bands were derived from point mutations or small deletions in the 5' region of BCL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The significance of this alteration to BCL2 function in translocation-carrying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
