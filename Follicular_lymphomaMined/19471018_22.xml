<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is genetically characterized by the presence of the t(14;18)(q32;q21) chromosomal translocation in approximately 90% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast to FL carrying the t(14;18), their t(14;18)-negative counterparts are less well studied about their immunohistochemical, genetic, molecular, and clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within a previously published series of 184 FLs grades 1 to 3A with available gene expression data, we identified 17 FLs lacking the t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparative genomic hybridization and high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array profiling showed that gains/amplifications of the BCL2 gene locus in 18q were restricted to the t(14;18)-positive FL subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A comparison of gene expression profiles showed an enrichment of germinal center B cell-associated signatures in t(14;18)-positive FL, whereas activated B cell-like, NFkappaB, proliferation, and bystander cell signatures were enriched in t(14;18)-negative FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings were confirmed by immunohistochemistry in an independent validation series of 84 FLs, in which 32% of t(14;18)-negative FLs showed weak or absent CD10 expression and 91% an increased Ki67 proliferation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although overall survival did not differ between FL with and without t(14;18), our findings suggest distinct molecular features of t(14;18)-negative FL </plain></SENT>
