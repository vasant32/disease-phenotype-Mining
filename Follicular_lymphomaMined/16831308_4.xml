<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The percentage, phenotypic profile and clonality pattern of bone marrow lymphoid infiltrate were analysed before and after RTX treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical, histological and molecular responses to RTX were correlated to the clinical outcome of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen out of twenty-six patients obtained a complete clinical remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A favourable histology--follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), hairy cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (HCL) and marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>)--was associated with a higher frequency of clinical CR and histological remission (HR), in comparison with mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (CLL) and lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (LPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patterns of bone marrow HR were observed: 1) complete lymphoid cell disappearance (9 patients); or 2) nodular/interstitial T-cell infiltration (10 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three histological persistence (HP) patterns were observed: 1) persistence of CD20+ small lymphoid cells in 1 patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>; 2) loss of CD20 antigen expression in 4 patients with CLL; or 3) persistence only of clusters of monotypic plasma cells in 2 patients with LPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CR and HR were strongly correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentage of lymphomatous infiltrate after RTX was higher in patients who subsequently died of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Molecular response showed no correlations with the further clinical course in 12 patients achieving a complete clinical remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, bone marrow morphological and immunohistochemical analysis with a restricted panel of antibodies is useful to avoid 42% false positive and 85% false negative interpretations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Persistence of monoclonality after RTX might have a role in evaluating the molecular pattern of CD20-negative clones that can emerge after RTX as a tumoral escape to therapy </plain></SENT>
