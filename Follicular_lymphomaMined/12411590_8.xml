<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Quantification of t(14;18) carrying cells in FL patients can be achieved by real-time PCR, a highly sensitive technique for evaluating treatment efficacy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the many advantages of real-time technology for this purpose, one disadvantage is that current real-time t(14;18) PCR assays amplify a control gene as a normalizer in a separate reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since each PCR reaction has its own kinetics, separate PCR assays for target and control sequences can potentially result in inaccurate quantification of t(14;18)-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the real-time t(14;18) PCR assays do not determine the size of the amplified fusion sequence, which is helpful for excluding contamination and is commonly used to demonstrate clonal identity between pre- and post-treatment specimens from a patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To address these limitations, we designed a multiplex real-time PCR protocol that allows amplification of control and target genes in the same reaction and precise size determination of bcl-2/JH fusion sequences by capillary electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This multiplex PCR assay is equally sensitive to previous assays, allows more accurate quantification of bcl-2/JH fusion sequences, and is more convenient </plain></SENT>
