<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, cytodiagnosis of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of bone has not been well documented because of its rarity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We undertook a retrospective study of 25 cases of FNA cytologic specimens of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The slides were available for review in 20 cases; each case was evaluated with 15 cytologic features in conjunction with immunophenotyping and available surgical materials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three diagnostic categories were assigned, including nondiagnostic (4/16%), suspicious (3/12%), and malignant (18/72%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 18 malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were diagnosed on the basis of cytologic materials together with immunocytochemistry, except that two cases also relied on the cell blocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The nondiagnostic and suspicious cases were subsequently confirmed to be malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> on the surgical core biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 25 cases, 23 cases were large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, one follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> large cell type, and one small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>False-positive or false-negative cases were not present in this study series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the vast majority of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of bone can be accurately diagnosed and classified on FNA cytologic specimens in conjunction with immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The nondiagnostic and suspicious categories can be further reduced or eliminated by improving FNA techniques or by recommendation of surgical core biopsies together with other techniques such as flow cytometry and molecular analysis </plain></SENT>
