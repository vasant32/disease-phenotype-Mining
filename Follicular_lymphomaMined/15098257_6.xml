<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The cytomorphologic diagnosis of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) can be difficult and requires ancillary studies for accurate subclassification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More than 95% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCLs</z:e> are known to carry the t(11;14) chromosomal translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, traditional cytogenetic studies on cytologic material can be both difficult technically and time consuming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can be a powerful tool for detecting chromosomal changes in individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors evaluated the utility of interphase FISH for the rapid detection of t(11;14) in archival cytologic material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The cytopathology data bases at two institutions were searched for patients with well characterized <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> (biopsy, immunophenotyping) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> (8 fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> samples and 2 body cavity fluid samples) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The area of interest on the cytology slides was marked and hybridized with two-color, locus-specific identifier DNA probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A dual-fusion probe signal was used to detect the juxtaposition of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) (14q32) locus with cyclin D1 (CCND1) gene sequences (11q13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Samples with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell nuclei that showed at least one yellow fusion signal in addition one green signal (IgH) and one orange signal (CCND1) were interpreted as positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Positive and negative controls were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The t(11;14) translocation was detected by FISH in 10 of 10 patients (100%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The cytomorphology of small-to-intermediate cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and marginal zone/mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, can show overlapping cytomorphologic features with one another as well as with reactive lymphoid proliferations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In selected samples in which specific classification is not possible or when confirmation is required on a small sample size, molecular analysis and cytogenetics may be helpful in arriving at an unambiguous cytodiagnosis and subclassification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Distinction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> from other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is important, because the clinical course is aggressive, and response to conventional chemotherapy is poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This study showed that the detection of t(11;14) by FISH can be performed rapidly and easily on archival cytologic material for the molecular diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
