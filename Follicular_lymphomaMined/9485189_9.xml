<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expression of B7 molecules by antigen-presenting cells (APC) provides co-stimulatory signals to T lymphocytes via CD28 and CTLA-4 which prevent the induction of alloantigen-specific tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conversely, expression of CD40 ligand by stimulated T cells activates APC via CD40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In human hematological B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>), the defect in alloantigen presentation of tumoral cells can be repaired by up-regulation of B7 and other co-stimulatory molecules via CD40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied the role of B7 molecules in alloimmune recognition and the various ways to improve the antitumoral response on peripheral blood leukemic cells from 20 patients with a diagnosis of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We focused on myelo/monocytic M4/M5 French-American-British classification subtypes which are considered as the neoplastic counterpart of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> monocytes, a prototypic APC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one-way mixed lymphocyte reaction of CD4+ T cells against leukemic cells, differences in B7-1, B7-2 or CD40 expression by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cells did not induce specific cytokine secretion; interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon (IFN)-gamma were detected but not IL-4, corresponding to a Th1 pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blockade experiments showed that proliferation and IFN-gamma secretion only partially depended on B7 molecules, which in contrast had a pivotal role in IL-2 synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast with murine models which suggest a pivotal role for CD80/B7-1 in the immune response against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, our data support a greater role for CD86/B7-2, in line with the baseline expression of CD86/B7-2 and lack of CD80/B7-1 on most M4/M5 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cell stimulation via CD40: (1) significantly improved IL-2 secretion but not proliferation of responding T lymphocytes, (2) increased CD54/ICAM-1 expression in three quarters of cases, (3) failed in most cases to induce CD40-specific CD80/B7-1 up-regulation, and (4) had a weak effect on CD86/B7-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data contrast with the very efficient up-regulation of both B7 co-stimulatory molecule expression and tumoral cell alloimmune recognition following CD40 stimulation in B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The role of the defective B7 molecule up-regulation by the CD40 pathway in inefficient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> immunogenicity of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cells has to be further investigated, in particular using transfection experiments of CD80/B7-1-deficient <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>From our in vitro data we conclude that B7 molecules play an important role in the alloimmune surveillance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> as suggested by the high B7 molecule dependency of IL-2 secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the contribution of B7 molecules to alloimmune T cell proliferation against primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cells in human and the way to improve it--regulation via CD40 in particular--differ from B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and murine models, suggesting the requirement for specific strategies in the development of antitumor immunity </plain></SENT>
