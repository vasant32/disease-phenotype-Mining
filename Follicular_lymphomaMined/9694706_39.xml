<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The immunoglobulin on the surface of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> can be a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific target for monoclonal antibody therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 1981 and 1993, 45 individuals with low grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were treated with 52 courses of custom-made anti-idiotype antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antibodies were used either alone or in combination with alpha-interferon, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi>, or interleukin-2 (IL-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of these patients responded to treatment, with a 66% overall and 18% complete response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients (13%) experienced prolonged complete remissions, five of which are ongoing from 4 to 10 years after therapy and are the subject of this report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We asked whether residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> could be found in these patients with prolonged remissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assays for idiotype protein or anti-idiotype antibodies in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood and bone marrow samples were examined by flow cytometry for idiotype positive cells, and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for clonal gene rearrangements of immunoglobulin CDR3 sequences or t(14;18) translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using these sensitive and specific tests it was possible to detect very low levels of residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in five of these patients who had been in clinical remission for 3 to 8 years before this evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These five have continued without recurrence for up to 3 years since </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, we have found a pattern of residual inactive disease in patients treated with anti-idiotype antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The biology of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> evidently includes the potential for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> dormancy after therapies with varied mechanisms of action, resulting in clinical inactivity for many years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, long-term control of the disease is possible at a clinical level despite persistence of the malignant clone </plain></SENT>
