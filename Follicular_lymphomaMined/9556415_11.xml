<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The neoplastic cells of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs) are thought to derive from follicular B lymphocytes, but their relationship to GCDCs remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study used immunohistochemical staining for fascin, a 55-kDa actin-bundling protein strongly expressed in GCDCs and their processes, to evaluate their distribution in neoplastic follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-two cases of B-cell FL were evaluated, and immunoreactive staining for fascin was compared with six cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017531" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GLNH|AFLH">Castleman's disease</z:e> (CD) and six cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FLs generally revealed decreased or absent fascin-staining GCDCs, suggesting loss of fascin expression by dendritic cells in neoplastic follicles compared with hyperplastic follicular centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In some follicles, there was partial retention of dendritic architecture with islands of residual syncytial network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interdigitating reticulum cells in the parafollicular regions revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fascin expression with intense staining of dendritic processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast with FLs, cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or increased fascin-positive follicular dendritic cells, and in cases of hyaline vascular CD, follicular dendritic cells revealed tight syncytial networks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that GCDCs are deficient in neoplastic follicles, compared with benign reactive or hyperplastic follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This alterations in the germinal center microenvironment might explain the inability of FL cells to present antigen to T lymphocytes and to mount an effective antitumor immune response </plain></SENT>
