<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This retrospective study was undertaken to evaluate the outcome of patients with stage I or II (limited stage), grade I-II follicular non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) treated with radiation therapy (RT) alone as initial management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with stage I or II and pathologically confirmed WHO grade I or II FL treated initially with RT alone between 1982 and 2008 were identified from a population based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty patients with a mean age 61.3 years at diagnosis were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median follow up was 6.9 years from the end of radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stage was I (n = 26) and II (n = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None had B symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) was low risk in 26 patients and intermediate risk in 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Doses ranged from 15 Gy to 48 Gy, with a median dose of 35 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients achieved a complete clinical response (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>5 and 10 year overall survival (OS) was 86% and 59%, progression free survival (PFS) 67% and 54% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age ≥60 at diagnosis was associated with reduced OS, p = 0.029, but did not affect PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No other clinical features including grade or FLIPI were significant for outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Local failure was uncommon occurring in 8% (3/40) although this was 21% (3/14) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: OS and PFS outcomes for radiation alone in limited stage low grade FL patients from this single institution study are consistent with previously published data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No predictors were prognostic for PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A dose of ≤35 Gy may be appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In this highly selected homogeneous group the FLIPI loses discriminating ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Local control is excellent, and a majority of patients are free of disease after 5 years </plain></SENT>
