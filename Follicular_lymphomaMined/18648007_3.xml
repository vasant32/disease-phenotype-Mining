<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The chromosomal translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21) is one of the most common chromosomal abnormalities in NHL, occurring in 70%-90% of cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 20%-30% of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 5%-10% of other less common subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18)-positive NHL may represent a homogenous group and, consequently, increase etiologic specificity in epidemiological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the t(14;18) has important clinical ramifications, its etiologic significance remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two population-based, case-control studies addressed this issue by evaluating potential risk factors for t(14;18)-positive and t(14;18)-negative subgroups of NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both studies found that the association between <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> exposures and risk of NHL was largely limited to t(14;18)-positive NHL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the findings regarding cigarette smoking, family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic cancer</z:e>, and hair dye use were not entirely consistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that defining subgroups of NHL according to t(14;18) status may be useful for etiologic research, particularly for exposures that are genotoxic or may contribute to the development of NHL through pathways involving the t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Studies to further evaluate these associations and delineate the effects of various exposures in other genetically defined subgroups of NHL are warranted </plain></SENT>
