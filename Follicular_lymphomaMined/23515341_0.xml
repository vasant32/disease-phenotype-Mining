<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the feasibility of double-balloon endoscopy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBE</z:chebi>) to detect jejunoileal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, compared with fluorodeoxyglucose <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (FDG-PET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between March 2004 and January 2011, we histologically confirmed involvement of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the jejunoileum in 31 patients by <z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBE</z:chebi> and biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 20 patients of them, we performed with FDG-PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed the records of these 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their median age was 64 years (range 50-81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 20 patients, the pathological diagnosis of underlying non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) comprised follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL, n = 12), diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, n = 4), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, n = 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002242'>enteropathy</z:hpo> associated T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ETL, n = 1) and anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e>, n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten cases showed accumulation by FDG-PET (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FDG-PET was positive in 3 of 12 FL cases (25%) while in 7 of 8 non-FL cases (88%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intestinal FL showed a significantly lower rate of positive FDG-PET, in comparison with other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cases with endoscopically elevated lesions (n = 10) showed positive FDG-PET in 2 (20%), but those with other type NHL did in 8 of 10 (80%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When the cases having elevated type was compared with those not having elevated type lesion, the number of cases that showed accumulation of FDG was significantly smaller in the former than in the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a significant proportion, small intestinal involvement cannot be pointed out by FDG-PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Especially, FL is difficult to evaluate by FDG-PET but essentially requires <z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBE</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
