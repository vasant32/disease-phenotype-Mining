<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was demonstrated in 17 out of 71 cases submitted to light or electron microscopic immunoperoxidase methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Out of 19 cases examined by the electron microscopic immunoperoxidase method, immunoglobulins were intracellularly identified in 10 cases; 3 out of 6 cases which were diagnosed as follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 3 out of 5 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024302" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">reticulosarcoma</z:e>, 2 out of 6 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079734" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphosarcoma</z:e> and 2 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Out of the above 10 cases, IgM was demonstrated in 9 cases except one of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> in which IgA, IgG and IgM were identified intracellularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to these findings, our ultracytological and pathological studies have indicated that immunoglobulin-producing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> can be classified into the following three major groups according to their cellular origin; germinal centers (group 1), primary follicles (group 2) and extrafollicular (group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group 1 is comprised of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024302" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">reticulosarcoma</z:e>, group 2 lymphosarcoma, and group 3 immunoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
