<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 120 patients with bi-dimensionally measurable FL or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> (R.E.A.L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Classification) were treated with Rituximab 375 mg/m2/week for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A central pathology review confirmed the diagnosis of FL in 76 of 78 and of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> in 39 of 42 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The response was evaluated after 8 weeks and confirmed after 12 weeks from the start of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The toxicity of the treatment was, as expected, grade 1-2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and rigors during the first infusion and mild asthenia during the treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serious adverse events, probably or possibly related to the study treatment, included four <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (3 of cardiac origin, 1 caused by P. carinii <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>) and 10 further nonfatal cases, including a permanent <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> and one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Response rate at week 12 was 52% for FL and 22% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After treatment, the BCL-2 rearrangement disappeared in 15 of 29 blood but only in 5 of 23 bone marrow samples; BCL-1 disappeared in 5 of 12 blood and 0 of 7 bone marrow specimens, as determined by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Rituximab is an active agent for the treatment of FL, while its efficacy is modest in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effect in reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> is more pronounced on the blood than it is on the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
