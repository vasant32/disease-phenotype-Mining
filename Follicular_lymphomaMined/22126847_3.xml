<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The prognostic value of grading follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has been debated since the 1980s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is consensus that World Health Organization (WHO) grades 1 and 2 are indolent, but not whether grades 3A or 3B are aggressive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnoses according to the 2008 WHO classification in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diagnostic specimens from a population-based cohort of 505 patients with a median follow-up time of 10·0years (range, 4·6-16·0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After excluding 43 patients with concomitant diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 345 remained with grade 1-2, 94 with grade 3A, and 23 with grade 3B follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Grades 1-2 and 3A seemed equally indolent, with indistinguishable clinical courses, even in patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with grades 1-3A and independently of clinical factors, grade 3B correlated with higher mortality (P=0·008), but outcome was improved after upfront <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-containing therapy (P=0·015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to grade 1-3A patients, grade 3B patients experienced no relapses or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> beyond 5years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients with grade 3B were predominantly male and seldom presented with bone-marrow involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade 1-3A is indolent and incurable with conventional therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Grade 3B appears to be an aggressive but curable disease </plain></SENT>
