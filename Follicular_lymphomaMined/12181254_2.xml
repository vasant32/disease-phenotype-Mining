<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to explore the association between extent of cutaneous involvement, presenting features and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with primary cutaneous non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (PCNHL) of aggressive histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Previously untreated patients with localized or extensive PCNHL of aggressive histology, treated with combination chemotherapy, but excluding lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mycosis fungoides</z:e> and its variants, were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 53 patients, of whom 52 (35 males, 17 females) were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-based regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median age was 52 years (range 25-81 years), and disease was localized and extensive in 37 and 16 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients had diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, nine had grade 3 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 13 had peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e>; not otherwise specified) and seven had anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (WHO classification) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 101 months (range 2-237 months) for survivors, the 10-year PFS was 65 +/- 7% and overall survival was 72 +/- 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first failure involved the skin in 33% of B-cell and 91% of relapsing T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis revealed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e> (P = 0.005), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> (P = 0.01) and high serum levels of beta(2)-microglobulin (P = 0.0006) and LDH (P = 0.002), but not extent of skin involvement, were associated with inferior PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that only <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e> and high serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) were independently associated with inferior PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e> and elevated serum LDH level, but not extent of cutaneous involvement are associated with inferior PFS in aggressive PCNHL treated with combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
