<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three major groups were found according to cell type, with different clinical features: (1) Small cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with a relatively favourable survival in spite of high relapse rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(2) Large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with lower relapse rates, but short time between relapse and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and unfavourable survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(3) Mixed small/large cleaved follicular centre cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> which was most favourable with respect to relapse and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had the same overall relapse rate as diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but had a significantly longer survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumours</z:e> stage I were associated with significantly longer relapse-free survival and survival than stage II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The importance of separating the majority of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> into three main groups according to cell type is emphasized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These major groups require different clinical approaches in terms of staging and treatment </plain></SENT>
