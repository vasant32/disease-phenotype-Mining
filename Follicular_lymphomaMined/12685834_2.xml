<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy-three patients with FL were registered to the study and treated with combination chemotherapy consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, epidoxorubicin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, weekly administered every 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After chemotherapy, involved-field radiotherapy was delivered in case of either localized, bulky and extranodal disease at presentation or limited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> at the end of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient received four or eight chemotherapy courses in case of localized or advanced disease, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate at the end of the treatment program was 97.3%, with 78.1% CR and 19.2% PR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CR rate was 94.3 and 63.1% in stage I-II and III-IV, respectively (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Beside the stage, response rate was significantly influenced by bone marrow involvement, and the number of extranodal sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relapse free survival was 60.8% at 5 years in the whole series; in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e> it was 70.3 vs. 44.8% in advanced disease (p = 0.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relapse free survival was significantly influenced by stage, bone marrow involvement, number of extranodal sites and International Prognostic Index (IPI) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall 5-year survival rate was 90.2%; being 95.6% for patients with stage I-II and 85.1% for those III-IV (p = 0.0133) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, both IPI and Italian <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Intergroup (ILI) score had a significant impact on survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The toxicity profile of the treatment was acceptable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>From the results of this prospective study it is possible to conclude that this regimen and the whole treatment program is effective as first line therapy for the general population of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In particular the BACOP schedule is a valid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-containing regimen, and in this respect suitable to be considered as a treatment option </plain></SENT>
