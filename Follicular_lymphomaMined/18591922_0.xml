<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of lymphoproliferative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> which can have differing patterns of behavior and clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unlike <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, Non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> is much less predictable and has a far greater predilection for disseminating to extranodal sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We offer a case of a 50 year old Caucasian male who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>, and was ultimately diagnosed with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> by means of liver biopsy, in conjunction with immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> grew at a rapid rate and over came our patient in a short period of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combination of a large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden and cardiac infiltration made resuscitation extremely difficult when it became necessary, and this also made a positive outcome unlikely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is rare for an immunocompetent patient to present with cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> without any previous signs and symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Due to the rarity and the vague clinical presentation there must be a high degree of suspicion in order to diagnose cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As evidenced by this case time is of the essence to increase the likelyhood of survival in these patients </plain></SENT>
