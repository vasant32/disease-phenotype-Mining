<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The capacity of anti-idiotype antibody to home to the target <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> requires that the idiotype be unique and that it be expressed by every cell in the neoplastic clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the evolution of an altered idiotype in a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that resulted in escape from laboratory detection by monoclonal anti-idiotype antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was not due to the emergence of a second (biclonal) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, since <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the neoplastic cells were otherwise identical both phenotypically and genotypically, as determined by flow cytometry and genomic DNA (Southern blot) hybridization, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cells expressed the same B-cell immunotype and bore a constant amount of IgMk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The demonstration of a single configuration of immunoglobulin-gene DNA confirmed monoclonality and established that the change in idiotype was not a result of new gene rearrangements but was more likely due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> of the variable region--a process presumed to occur naturally in B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate the lability of idiotype expression and define a mechanism by which B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> may become unresponsive to anti-idiotype therapy </plain></SENT>
