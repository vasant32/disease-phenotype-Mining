<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We conducted a multicenter, retrospective study to determine the anatomical distribution and prognostic factors of gastrointestinal (GI) follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study included 125 patients with stage I and II(1) GI-FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 125 patients, the small intestine was examined in 70 patients, with double-balloon endoscopy and/or capsule endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most frequently involved GI-FL site was the duodenal second portion (DSP) (81%), followed by the jejunum (40%); 85% of patients with involvement of the DSP also had jejunal or ileal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011458'>abdominal symptoms</z:hpo> and macroscopic appearance of multiple nodules were significantly present in the DSP-positive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During a median follow up of 40 months, six patients showed disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with involvement of the DSP had better progression-free survival (PFS) than those without such involvement (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis revealed that male sex, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011458'>abdominal symptoms</z:hpo>, and negative involvement of the DSP were independently associated with poor PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, most patients with GI-FL have <z:mp ids='MP_0002580'>duodenal lesions</z:mp> associated with multiple jejunal or ileal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gastrointestinal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> involving the DSP might be a distinct entity showing a favorable clinical course </plain></SENT>
