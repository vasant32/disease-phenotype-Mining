<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to determine whether RS-like cells found in seven B-cell low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were immunologically similar to the neoplastic cells in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or to the true RS cells seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, and whether they were therefore indicative of a composite <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies were performed on paraffin sections of the seven low-grade (one small lymphocytic, one mantle zone, and five follicular) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with a panel of antibodies reactive with leukocyte common antigen (LCA), B-cell, T-cell, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> associated antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The RS-like cells were reactive with LCA (four of six), L26 (seven of seven), LN1 (five of six), LN2 (two of six), and MB2 (three of six) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No positive staining was seen with either Leu-M1 or Ber-H2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The RS-like cells in the mantle zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> expressed L26, Leu-22, and kappa cytoplasmic light chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This immunophenotype is similar to that of the neoplastic small lymphocytic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of the low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> progressed to an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with many RS-like cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Paraffin immunohistochemistry on both lesions revealed a similar B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> for the RS-like cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunogenetic studies revealed B-cell and bcl-2 gene rearrangements in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With careful morphologic examination augmented by immunohistochemical studies, these lesions can be differentiated from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and from composite <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the combined Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's type </plain></SENT>
