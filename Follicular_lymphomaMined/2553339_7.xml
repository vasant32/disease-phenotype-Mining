<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Telomeric fusions were observed in several subclones, with the nonrandom involvement of chromosomes 1, 5, 12, and 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Centromeric staining with immunofluorescent anti-kinetochore antibodies was positive in both centromeres of the fused chromosomes, suggesting they were both active </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unlike previously reported cases, we were unable to demonstrate telomeric fusions directly in cells from the patient's blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the finding of identical immunoglobulin gene rearrangements in DNA from the patient's blood and cell line suggested that they originated from the same malignant B-cell clone </plain></SENT>
