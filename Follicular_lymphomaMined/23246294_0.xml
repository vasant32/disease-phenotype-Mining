<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Strategies integrating various biological data sets with GWAS results will provide insights into the mechanistic role of associated SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we present a method that integrates <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> sequencing (<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-seq) and allele-specific expression data with GWAS data to further characterize SNPs associated with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the influence on gene expression of three established FL-associated loci-rs10484561, rs2647012, and rs6457327-by measuring their correlation with human-leukocyte-antigen (HLA) expression levels obtained from publicly available <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-seq expression data sets from lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that SNPs linked to the protective variant rs2647012 exert their effect by a cis-regulatory mechanism involving modulation of HLA-DQB1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no effect on HLA expression was observed for the colocalized risk variant rs10484561 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The application of integrative methods, such as those presented here, to other post-GWAS investigations will help identify causal disease variants and enhance our understanding of biological disease mechanisms </plain></SENT>
