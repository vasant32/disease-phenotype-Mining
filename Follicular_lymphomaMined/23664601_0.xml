<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its activity in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> has not been studied as yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, the autophagic activity of lymphoid cells was investigated in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL; 48 cases), diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>; 78 cases), and in reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasias</z:hpo> (41 cases), using the light chain 3A (LC3A) antibody and a standard immunohistochemical technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the pattern of LC3A reactivity was uniformly diffuse cytoplasmic, but expressed more frequently in FLs (68.8%) than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> (41%) (p=0.02), and much more commonly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> than in reactive lymph nodes (24.3%) (p&lt;0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, FLs expressing LC3A in &gt;10% of lymphoid cells (high reactivity) were associated with the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-related protein HIF1Î± and the enzyme of anaerobic metabolism <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase LDH5 (p=0.004 and p=0.003, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such associations, however, were not a feature in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> of increased LC3A activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LC3A expression in FLs is <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-induced, whereas its expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> may be regulated by other molecular mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The current study provides a tool for further assessment of autophagic activity in translational and autophagy targeting therapy studies </plain></SENT>
