<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Leukemic involvement in mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) is common, and can be secondary to nodal or extranodal disease or can be de-novo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is paucity of literature that describes the morphological spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aim: This study was aimed at studying the morphological spectrum of leukemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> and to correlate the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> with other features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty six such cases diagnosed over a period of four years were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood and bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> smears stained with Wrights stain were examined by three hematopathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotyping was done using multicolor flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) done in 12 cases showed t(11;14)(q13:q32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six cases had de-novo leukemic involvement; while 20 cases had secondary involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Morphologically, the cells were small (less than twice the size of red blood cell) or large </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Small cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in turn showed irregular nuclear border (n=13) or round nuclear contour (n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Large cells had blastic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> (n=5) or had central prominent nucleoli resembling prolymhphocytes (n=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty cases showed characteristic immunophenotype of CD5+/CD19+/CD20+/FMC7+/CD10-/CD23- and light chain restrictions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three cases expressed CD23 and two cases were negative for FMC7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Five out of 12 cases, where FISH was done, showed cytogenetic abnormalities in addition to t(11;14)(q13;q32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Morphological spectrum of leukemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> ranges from small cells resembling <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) to large cell mimicking prolymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53412">PLL</z:chebi>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Large cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was associated with more frequent additional cytogenetic abnormality as well as a poorer outcome </plain></SENT>
