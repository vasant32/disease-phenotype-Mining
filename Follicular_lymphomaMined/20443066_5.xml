<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This prospective study was performed to evaluate the effect of chemotherapy-related neurotoxicity on quality of life (QOL) of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two patients with diffuse large B-cell or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> without prior evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent the evaluations based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> symptom and disability score, nerve conduction studies, and SF-36 questionnaire for QOL assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They received six cycles of chemotherapy every three weeks, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> evaluations were repeated during and after the completion of 6th cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>Sensory neuropathy</z:hpo>-associated symptoms were observed in 27 patients (84.4%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> was confirmed by nerve conduction study in 14 patients (43.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> showed worse QOL in domains mainly associated with physical health status including "physical function" compared to patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> symptom and disability scores with "bodily pain" and "vitality" of QOL domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The serial evaluations of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> showed a worsening of QOL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> symptom scores during chemotherapy, then improvement of these values after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the final nerve conduction study confirmed the decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> compared to the 2nd evaluation (P = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> may deteriorate QOL of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mainly physical health-associated QOL </plain></SENT>
