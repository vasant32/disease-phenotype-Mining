<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: The incidence of extra nodal non Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ENL) is rising throughout the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data regarding ENL as a group is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to study the epidemiological and histomorphological trends of primary ENL (pENL) in India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The biopsy materials from sixty eight patients with pENL (45 male, 23 female, M:F= 1.9:1), diagnosed over a five year period (2005-2009), were analysed and pathologically reclassified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, 2008 criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Primary extra nodal non Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> constituted 22.0% (68/308) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age at presentation for pENL and primary nodal NHL was 43 years and 58 years, respectively with a male predilection (M: F=2:1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) constituted the most common extranodal site (20/68, 29.5%) followed by gastrointestinal tract (17/68, 25%), and nose/nasopharynx (8/68, 11.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, not otherwise specified), extranodal marginal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type, and B cell NHL unclassified (U) were the three most common histological types observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>T-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> was rarely noted (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, seen among nodal NHL, were absent at extra nodal sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Majority (41/68, 60%) of the patients with pENL were immunocompetent and 55% were in stage I-II with favorable prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system was the most common site of ENL, followed by gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Majority of pENL occurred in immunocompetent hosts with a favorable prognosis </plain></SENT>
