<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cryopreserved bone marrow and/or peripheral blood samples obtained at different time intervals after SCT from 11 patients (seven allogeneic, T-cell depleted/four autologous) were tested for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> load, as defined by t(14;18) positive cells/total cells, using RQ-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of the six patients who remained in remission had samples with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> load &gt;0.01% after SCT, although fluctuating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> loads of &lt;/=0.01% were observed in three of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, four of the five patients (three allogeneic/two autologous) with relapsed/progressive disease had increasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> loads of &gt;0.01% after SCT (0/6 vs 4/5, P&lt;0.02, Fisher's exact) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that RQ-PCR measurable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> load &gt;0.01% after SCT may correlate with relapsed/progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies with greater numbers of cases are indicated to better determine the critical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> load that predicts poor outcome after SCT with RQ-PCR </plain></SENT>
