<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The International Prognostic Index (IPI) is the most commonly used prognostic model for mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the prognostic value of the IPI is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The recently published Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) is built on variables, which are pertinent to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to evaluate the prognostic value of FLIPI in a population-based series of 93 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> diagnosed in a 7-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>End points of the study were response to therapy, overall survival, and disease-free survival (DFS) according to the IPI and FLIPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Applied to the whole series, the FLIPI identified three risk groups with markedly different outcome with 5-year overall survival rates of 65%, 42%, and 8% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Notably, the high-risk group comprised 53% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the IPI only allocated 16% of cases to the high-risk group and had a lower overall predictive capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When both the FLIPI and IPI were included in a multivariate analysis, only the FLIPI was related to survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis of DFS also identified the FLIPI, and not the IPI, as independently significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, in the present study, the FLIPI was superior as a prognostic model compared with the IPI and can therefore be recommended as a clinical prognostic index for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
