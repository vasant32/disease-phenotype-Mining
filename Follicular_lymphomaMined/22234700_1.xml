<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have developed a novel vaccine against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> consisting of an anti-CD40 Ab (ADX40) chemically conjugated to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> idiotype A20 and tested it in a murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BALB/c mice were immunized with 2 doses of immunogen alone or in conjunction with additional adjuvants before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ADX40-Id vaccination resulted in significantly retarded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> and reduced mouse morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, similar mouse survival was obtained with 2 injections of ADX40-Id as with 8 injections using the standard therapy of keyhole limpet hemocyanin Id + GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Co-administration of ADX40-Id with 3-O-deacyl-4'-monophosphoryl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47040">lipid A</z:chebi> further significantly enhanced vaccine efficacy, resulting in an increased overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-Id-specific Abs were detected at elevated levels after ADX40-Id immunization; however, in vivo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of CD4 and/or CD8 T cells before challenge showed that CD8 effector T cells were the major mediators of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study show that the ADX40-Id conjugate vaccine is a potential candidate as a stand-alone vaccine or in combination with currently licensed adjuvants for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
