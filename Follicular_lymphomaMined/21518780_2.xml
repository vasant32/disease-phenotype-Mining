<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: T cells influence outcome in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but their contributions seem to be modified by therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their impact in patients receiving rituximab without chemotherapy is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using flow cytometry, we evaluated the T cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and/or blood in a total of 250 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients included in two Nordic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Group randomized trials that compared single rituximab with IFN-α2a-rituximab combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In univariate analysis, higher levels of CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+) T cells in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and blood correlated with superior treatment responses, and in multivariate analysis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-CD3(+) (P = 0.011) and blood-CD4(+) (P = 0.029) cells were independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD4(+) cells were favorable regardless of treatment arm, but CD8(+) cells were favorable only in patients treated with single rituximab, because IFN-α2a improved responses especially in patients with low CD8(+) cell levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher levels of blood-CD3(+) (P = 0.003) and blood-CD4(+) (P = 0.046) cells predicted longer overall survival, and higher levels of blood-CD8(+) cells longer times to next treatment (P = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that therapeutic effects of rituximab are augmented by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated T cells for rapid responses and by systemic T cells for sustained responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells are both favorable in patients treated with rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IFN-α2a abrogates the negative impact of few CD8(+) cells </plain></SENT>
