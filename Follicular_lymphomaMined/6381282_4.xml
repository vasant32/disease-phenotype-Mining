<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunoregulatory lymphocyte subsets identified with T8 and Leu-7 monoclonal antibodies were quantified within the follicular centers (FC) of the nonneoplastic tissue and neoplastic follicles of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with an optical grid defining a unit surface area (USA) of 0.04 mm2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T8+ cells were essentially confined to the interfollicular areas, with a few cells occupying the FC of the nonneoplastic specimens (mean, two and five cells/USA for tonsils and benign lymph nodes, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> exhibited a similar pattern of distribution of T8+ cells, 17 T8+ cells/USA were observed in the follicular small cleaved cell (FSCL) group and eight T8+ cells/USA within the follicular mixed small cleaved and large cell (FML) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Leu-7+ cells were almost entirely confined to the FC of the nonneoplastic tissues and increased (mean, 17 and 19 cells/USA for tonsils and benign lymph nodes, respectively) compared with the T8+ population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Variable distributions of Leu-7+ cells were found in the FSCL group, with a mean of 16 cells/USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Very few Leu-7+ cells were present in the FML group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Natural killer cells and/or cytotoxic/suppressor T lymphocytes may play an immunoregulatory role in modulating the growth of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
