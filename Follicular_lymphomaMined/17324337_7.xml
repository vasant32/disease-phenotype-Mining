<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 45 previously untreated patients with FL were studied with PET and computed tomography (CT) scans after chemotherapy induction treatment (fludarabine-containing regimens and CHOP [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>] chemotherapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic analysis was performed when considered necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After treatment, 4 of 5 patients (80%) who had CT-negative/PET-positive findings experienced relapse/progression, compared with only 1 of 22 patients (4.5%) in the CT-negative/PET-negative subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 18 patients with CT-positive findings, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 patients (100%) who had PET-positive findings experienced relapse or progression, compared with 1 of 12 patients (8.3%) who had PET-negative findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 2-year progression-free survival rates were 20% and 90% in the CT-negative/PET-positive and CT-positive/PET-negative subsets, respectively (P = 0.0031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up, 2 patients, who presented a PET positivity with a negative CT scan, underwent a lymph node biopsy, which confirmed the presence of FL infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with FL, persisting PET positivity is predictive of early disease progression, because it is still highly likely that patients with PET-negative findings will ultimately progress, but this has not yet been manifested during the period of observation </plain></SENT>
