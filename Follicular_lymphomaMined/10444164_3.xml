<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD40 activation of FL cells up-regulates critical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and co-stimulatory molecules, thereby inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-specific cytotoxic T cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, other evidence suggests that CD70 is another important co-stimulatory molecule involved in antigen dependent T-cell activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we showed that freshly isolated FL cells from eight diagnostic biopsies expressed intermediate to high levels of CD27, whereas only insignificant levels of CD70 were detected on their cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Together with the low to intermediate expression of B7, these findings help to explain the poor antigen-presenting capacity of non-activated FL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Activation of FL cells by CD27 and CD40 induced a significantly higher alloantigen T-cell response than CD40 alone, whereas CD27 activation induced only a mostly insignificant T-cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both CD40 and CD27 + CD40 activation resulted in a high up-regulation of CD70 and B7 molecules, whereas CD27 activation up-regulated CD70 but not B7 expression on the surface of FL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, expression of both CD70 and B7 co-stimulatory molecules appears to be essential for an efficient T-cell-mediated immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the molecules responsible for the significantly higher alloantigen T-cell response to FL cells activated through CD27 and CD40 remain to be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, we conclude that CD27+CD70 represents another co-stimulatory pathway involved in T-cell-mediated immune responses to FL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that several co-stimulatory pathways exist and should be taken into consideration to optimize antigen presentation for the generation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-directed cytotoxic T cells for adoptive immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
