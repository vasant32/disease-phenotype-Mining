<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Apolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against a polymorphic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> on HLA DRbeta that demonstrated evidence for therapeutic activity in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In pre-clinical studies, we previously reported that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment significantly enhanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell killing by HLA class II antibodies, including apolizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These results suggested a combination trial of apolizumab and G-CSF (filgrastim) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this trial, we treated six patients with relapsed or refractory 1D10-positive non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with filgrastim and variable doses of apolizumab ranging from 0.15 to 1.5 mg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combination was clinically well tolerated, with only two patients experiencing grade III/IV hematological toxicity (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another patient developed a pruritic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo>, which was probably a treatment-related grade II <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1167791" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin toxicity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, two patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who received intensified apolizumab treatment on a three times weekly schedule experienced prolonged stabilization of their disease for 12 and more than 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this small pilot study suggests that a combination of HLA class II antibodies and G-CSF is clinically feasible </plain></SENT>
