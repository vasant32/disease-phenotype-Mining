<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cost-effectiveness (Life Years Gained--<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e>) and cost-utility analysis (Quality Adjusted Life Years--QALYs) were performed for a time horizon of 10 years, according to a Markov economic model with three health states (progression free survival, progression and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) and monthly cycles for a population of previously untreated patients with indolent NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data from a phase III clinical trial was used and expanded to include unpublished 53-month median follow-up data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival after first-line therapy was estimated from the Scotland and Newcastle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Group registry data and utilities were derived from a study in the UK performed in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Resource consumption was estimated by a Portuguese expert panel (Delbecq Panel) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Costs were calculated from the Portuguese NHS perspective through official data with prices updated to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only direct medical costs were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 5% per annum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed around assumptions on the time horizon, costs, utilities and excess mortality rate due to progression applied in the base-case analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 10-year base-case analysis showed a lower total cost per patient with CVP alone (€ 85,838) in comparison with R-CVP (€ 87,774) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Life expectancy and Quality adjusted life expectancy per patient were higher with R-CVP (6.361 and 4.166, respectively) than with CVP alone (5.557 and 3.438, respectively), representing increases of 0.804 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e> and 0.728 (8.7 months) in QALYs gained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incremental cost per <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e> was € 2,407 and the incremental cost per QALY gained was € 2,661 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the base-case analysis results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the combination R-CVP in previously untreated indolent NHL patients improves life expectancy and is a cost-effective alternative to CVP in Portugal </plain></SENT>
