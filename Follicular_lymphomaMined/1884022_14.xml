<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18) chromosomal translocation that results in the juxtaposition of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene with the heavy chain JH locus is a common cytogenetic abnormality in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, it is seen in about 85% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) and up to one-third of diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The chromosome 18 breakpoints have been shown to cluster into two regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The major breakpoint region (mbr) within the 3' untranslated region of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene accounts for approximately 60% of the cases and the minor cluster region (mcr) 30 kb 3' of bcl-2 accounts for approximately 25% of the breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because of variability in the position of the breakpoint, detection of the t(14;18) by Southern blot analysis provides an important clonal marker for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, conventional electrophoresis (CE) fails to detect the translocation in 15% to 25% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have applied pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to the detection of the t(14;18) in a series of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> prospectively analyzed by CE, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PFGE readily detected t(14;18) rearrangements as indicated by comigration of bands detected with probes for the mbr region (chromosome 18) and the JH locus (chromosome 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a series of 40 patients with FL, this method proved to be the most comprehensive for detection of the translocation compared with standard methods; in fact, in one case only PFGE was able to detect the chromosomal rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten percent of the FL cases were negative by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> methods tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a separate analysis of matched tissue specimens from cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> of FL to diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, PFGE detected a common t(14;18) rearrangement confirming a clonal origin in seven of seven cases, whereas CE detected a rearrangement in only three of seven cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, PFGE was able to detect a translocation in 8 of 12 cases that were negative by CE and four of eight negative by cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, PFGE analysis is more comprehensive than CE, PCR, and cytogenetic analysis for the detection of the t(14;18) breakpoint in tissue biopsies of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
