<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was investigated in a prospective randomized study in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relapsed disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 147 patients were randomized to receive 4 courses of chemotherapy with 25 mg/m(2) fludarabine on days 1 to 3, 200 mg/m(2) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> on days 1 to 3, and 8 mg/m(2) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> on day 1 (FCM), alone or combined with rituximab (375 mg/m(2); R-FCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 128 evaluable patients, 62 were randomized for FCM and 66 for R-FCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>R-FCM revealed an overall response rate of 79% (33% complete remission [CR], 45% partial remission [PR]) as compared with 58% for FCM alone (13% CR, 45% PR; P = .01), with similar results in a subgroup analysis of FL (94% vs 70%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> (58% vs 46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the total group, the R-FCM arm was significantly superior concerning progression-free survival (PFS; P = .0381) and overall survival (OS; P = .0030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In FL PFS was significantly longer in the R-FCM arm (P = .0139) whereas in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> a significantly longer OS was observed (P = .0042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in clinically relevant side effects in both study arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hence, the addition of rituximab to FCM chemotherapy significantly improves the outcome of relapsed or refractory FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
