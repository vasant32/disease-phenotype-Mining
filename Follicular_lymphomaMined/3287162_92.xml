<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To define the role of the protein product of the bcl-2 gene in lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, we used anti-bcl-2 antibodies to perform immunohistochemical studies of frozen sections of 136 tissue specimens affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1518396" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">non-neoplastic lymphoid disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactive bcl-2 protein was observed in the neoplastic cells in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, whereas no bcl-2 protein was detected in follicles affected by non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027671" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic processes</z:e> or in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid tissue </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data show consistent expression of a proto-oncogenic protein in a large proportion of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and provide further support of a role for bcl-2 in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with the t(14;18) karyotypic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased expression of bcl-2 after t(14;18) translocations may be a specific marker for B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, and demonstration of the protein with use of anti-bcl-2 antibodies could be useful in the diagnosis of many non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
