<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is currently no data on the reproducibility of histological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to determine the rates of inter- and intra-observer agreement in histological detection of bone marrow involvement in the two major subtypes of NHL, Diffuse Large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), and Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The bone marrow slides of randomly selected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and FL cases were independently examined by two hematologists using standardized reporting criteria on two occasions at least two weeks apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Samples included both aspirate and trephine biopsy slides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Weighted kappa statistics were used to examine agreement for the discrete measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Weighted kappa analyses showed variable inter-observer agreement in 38 DLBCL cases [aspirate=0.52; trephine= 0.77] and 38 FL cases [aspirate=0.48; trephine=0.77] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Overall, higher agreement rates were noted with trephine biopsies than with aspirates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Except for the high intra-observer agreement on trephine biopsy assessment in FL, there is poor agreement in histological staging of both FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> which demonstrates the limitations of histological diagnosis and the futility of interpreting ancillary tests against histology </plain></SENT>
