<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is characterized by the t(14;18) translocation resulting in constitutive expression of BCL-2 protein; however approximately 10-15% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> do not express BCL-2 protein, and a small fraction of these cases does not exhibit translocation of the BCL-2 gene either </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is highly debated whether cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> without BCL-2 gene rearrangement and expression represent a separate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> entity with distinct biological characteristics, different from the BCL-2-positive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: To further characterize follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> without BCL-2 gene rearrangement and expression, we analyzed and compared the mutational status of IGVH genes as well as other genes (C-MYC, PAX-5 and RHOH) frequently involved in the specific type of genomic instability called aberrant somatic hypermutation in 11 cases of BCL-2-negative and 7 cases of BCL-2-positive follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also determined the levels of expression of activation-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminase in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The analyzed cases were grade 2 and grade 3A follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate that follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> without BCL-2 gene rearrangement and expression are associated with ongoing somatic hypermutation of the IGVH genes, low activity of aberrant somatic hypermutation and elevated activation-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminase expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results were in concordance with the results found in the cases of BCL-2-positive follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although, BCL-2 protein overexpression is considered to be a critical pathogenic event in the development of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, our findings suggest that follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with the same <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, immunophenotype, mutational pattern and activation-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminase expression may develop without the involvement of BCL-2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present data support the hypothesis that BCL-2-positive and BCL-2-negative follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (grades 1-3A) represent a homogenous group with different initial but several common additional molecular pathways </plain></SENT>
