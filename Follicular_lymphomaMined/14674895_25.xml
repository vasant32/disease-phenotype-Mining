<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Primary cutaneous follicle centre cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (PCFCCLs) are the most common type of cutaneous B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is ongoing discussion on the origin of the neoplastic B cells in these PCFCCLs, and consequently on their relation to the groups of primary cutaneous marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (PCMZLs) and nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To define better the neoplastic B cells in PCFCCLs, and to find out if differences in the expression of the antiapoptopic protein Bcl-2, and Bcl-6 and CD10, molecules which are normally expressed by the neoplastic B cells in nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, might have diagnostic or prognostic significance in cutaneous B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pretreatment biopsies of well-defined groups of PCFCCL (n = 24), PCMZL (n = 14), primary cutaneous large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the leg (PCLBCL-leg; n = 19), secondary cutaneous follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 3) and cutaneous pseudo-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 6) were investigated by immunohistochemistry for expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-6 and CD10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The PCFCCLs consistently expressed Bcl-6, whereas CD10 and Bcl-2 were expressed in only one and two of 24 cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, PCMZLs were always negative for Bcl-6 and CD10, but were Bcl-2 positive, whereas skin and lymph node localizations of secondary cutaneous follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> consistently expressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of Bcl-2, Bcl-6 and CD10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reactive follicle centre cells in pseudo-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> expressed Bcl-6 (six of six cases) and CD10 (five of six cases), but not Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PCLBCL-leg was Bcl-6 positive and CD10 negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, irrespective of clinical outcome, and strongly expressed Bcl-2 protein in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study provide further support for the follicle centre cell origin of both PCFCCL and PCLBCL-leg, and indicate that staining for Bcl-2, Bcl-6 and CD10 can serve as an important adjunct in the differential diagnosis of cutaneous B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
