<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Microarray technology has recently led to the identification of molecular prognostic subgroups in non Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to determine the usefulness of ready-made macroarrays as routine diagnosis tools in haemato-pathology, we have analysed lymph node biopsies using a cDNA macroarray containing genes involved in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, including caspases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine biopsy specimens were analysed on total frozen tissues: 4 samples of B-cell follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), two of B-cell diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL), and three of non-neoplastic lymph nodes from benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0002840'>lymphadenitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight cell populations were sorted from fresh tissues: malignant B-cells from 2 FL cases and 2 DLCL cases, reactive B-cells from 1 benign lymph nodes, reactive T-cells from 1 benign lymph node, virgin (mantle zone) B-cells and germinal center (GC) B-cells from benign tonsils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) on paraffin sections was performed for localization of caspases 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the clustered array data, sorted cells from samples sharing common histological lesions grouped together, whereas the array/histology correlation was less satisfactory for tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression profiles of both array and IHC methods were correlated for most caspases and samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Variations in array profiles of sorted cell populations can be statistically associated with specific histological features, suggesting a possible diagnostic application of ready-made "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> macroarrays" in haematopathology </plain></SENT>
