<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This potentiating effect was also observed for a LMW-BCGF-dependent B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> derived from a lymphocytic nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other growth factors acting on fibroblasts, such as epidermal growth factor, alpha-thrombin, platelet-derived growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor-I did not display such enhancing effect on LMW-BCGF-driven proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activated, but not resting B cells were found to bear receptor sites for FGFs and from kinetics experiments, it is suggested that LMW-BCGF induces competence expression for FGFs in those cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the LMW-BCGF-elicited generation of inositoltrisphosphate resulting from polyphosphoinositides hydrolysis was increased in the presence of FGF </plain></SENT>
