<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was an open-label, single-arm, single-center phase II study enrolling 40 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the first week of the study, patients received two infusions of rituximab 375 mg/m2 administered 4 days apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two hours after the second infusion of rituximab, patients received the first of six cycles of fludarabine chemotherapy (25 mg/m2/d for 5 days on a 28-day cycle) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Single infusions of rituximab were administered 72 hours before the second, fourth, and sixth cycles of fludarabine, and two infusions of rituximab were given 4 weeks after the last cycle of fludarabine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment duration was 26 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An overall response rate of 90% (80% complete response rate) was achieved in the intent-to-treat population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar response rates were seen in treatment-naive and previously treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median duration of response has not been reached at 40+ months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up time in this study is 44 months (range, 15 to 66 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients positive for the 14;18 translocation in blood and/or marrow at enrollment, molecular remission was achieved in 88% of cases, with patients remaining negative for up to 4 years to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hematologic toxicity was manageable, and except for a 15% incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">zoster</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, infectious complications were rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nonhematologic toxicities were minimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Rituximab plus fludarabine was well tolerated and associated with an excellent complete response rate, including molecular remissions, in patients with low-grade or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
