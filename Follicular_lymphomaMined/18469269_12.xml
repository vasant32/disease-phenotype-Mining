<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dietary <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoids</z:chebi> are polyphenolic compounds proposed to be anticarcinogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">Flavonoids</z:chebi> are well-characterized <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> and metal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelators</z:chebi>, and certain <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoids</z:chebi> exhibit antiproliferative and antiestrogenic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the hypothesis that higher <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi> intake is associated with lower NHL risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: During 1998-2000, we identified incident NHL cases aged 20-74 y from 4 US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Controls without history of NHL were selected by random-digit dialing or from Medicare files and frequency-matched to cases by age, center, race, and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using 3 recently developed US Department of Agriculture nutrient-specific databases, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi> intake was estimated from participant responses to a 117-item food-frequency questionnaire (n = 466 cases and 390 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NHL risk in relation to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi> intake in quartiles was evaluated after adjustment for age, sex, registry, education, NHL family history, and energy intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher total <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi> intake was significantly associated with lower risk of NHL (P for trend &lt; 0.01): a 47% lower risk in the highest quartile of intake than in the lowest (95% CI: 31%, 73%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher intakes of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28802">flavonols</z:chebi>, epicatechins, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16366,38695">anthocyanidins</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26267">proanthocyanidins</z:chebi> were each significantly associated with decreased NHL risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similar patterns of risk were observed for the major NHL subtypes--diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 167) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 146) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A higher intake of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoids</z:chebi>, dietary components with several putative anticarcinogenic activities, may be associated with lower NHL risk </plain></SENT>
