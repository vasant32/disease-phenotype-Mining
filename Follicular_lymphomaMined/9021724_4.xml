<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although IVL is potentially curable with combination chemotherapy, diagnosis is often delayed, in part owing to the negative bone marrow biopsy specimens that are typical of this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that use of a more sensitive method of analysis might identify small clonal B-cell populations in histologically negative bone marrow biopsy specimens from patients with IVL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With use of a recently described assay for immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement based on the polymerase chain reaction, we demonstrated clonal B-cell populations in histologically negative marrow specimens from five (100%) of five patients with IVL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of these specimens demonstrated molecular evidence of the t(14;18) associated with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, providing no evidence for a common derivation of IVL and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In summary, molecular analysis of routine bone marrow biopsy sepcimens from patients in whom the diagnosis of IVL is entertained may facilitate prompt recognition of a lympho-proliferative disorder and thereby permit timely therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these findings suggest that despite histologically negative staging bone marrow biopsy specimens, IVL typically disseminates early in its course, thus arguing against the use of localized therapy in this disorder </plain></SENT>
