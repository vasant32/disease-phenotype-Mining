<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the time of PBSC mobilization, 25 patients were in first remission, while 22 patients had a history of previous treatment failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the same time, 43 patients had polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cells in samples from bone marrow (BM) and/or peripheral blood (PB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Independent of the remission status, high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support were administered for PBSC mobilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following high-dose conditioning therapy which consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (200 mg/kg) and hyperfractionated total body irradiation (TBI, 14.4 Gy) or BEAM (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="3423">carmustine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, melphalan), 34 patients received PCR-positive and 13 patients received PCR-negative autografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up time of 20 months (range, 6-50) post-transplantation, 33 patients were in remission, while 14 patients had relapsed after a median time of 14.5 months (range, 10-42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017923" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Andersen</z:e>-Gill proportional hazards regression model for the analysis of relapse-free survival, we found that PCR-positive findings in samples from BM and/or PB at any given time-point after transplantation were associated with an increased estimated hazard ratio of 4.5 in comparison with a PCR-negative finding (P=0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, patients included while they were in first remission had a smaller estimated hazard ratio of 0.3 when compared with patients with a history of previous treatment failure (P=0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the latter group of patients, this translates into a significantly smaller probability of relapse-free survival in comparison to patients who were in first remission at the time of PBSC-mobilization (P=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the remission status of the patients before autografting and the PCR status as assessed on the occasion of follow-up examinations are significant prognostic parameters for relapse-free survival in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> undergoing high-dose therapy with PBSC autografting </plain></SENT>
