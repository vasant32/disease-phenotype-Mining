<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Knowledge about key amino acids in the binding groove of native Bcl-2 contributing to this interaction will greatly facilitate the design of Bcl-2-specific inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are two different Bcl-2 sequences, M13994 and M14745, in Genbank </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chimeric proteins Bcl-2(1) and Bcl-2(2) derived from the above sequences, although similar in structure, showed different binding affinities to Bak and Bad <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30153">BH3</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (Petros et al., 2001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we show that the Bcl-2(1) sequence in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> human tissue samples differs from M13994 and M14745, and contains P59, T96, R110, S117 and G237 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The actual sequence in the binding pocket matches the Bcl-2-Ig fusion sequence X06487, originally identified in a t(14:18) translocation of the Bcl-2 gene, associated with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The possible effects of the observed amino acid differences compared to M13994 and M14745 were investigated by combining structural data with fluorescence anisotropy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>G110R substitution confers on Bcl-2(1) substantially increased binding affinity to Bak, Bad and Bax <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30153">BH3</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, demonstrating that R110 is a key contributor to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30153">BH3</z:chebi> binding affinity of Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although NMR structure did not predict R110 involvement in binding to these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30153">BH3</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, fluorescence anisotropy data clearly points to a critical role for this residue in binding to pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members </plain></SENT>
