<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate the role of BNIP3, a 19-kDa interacting protein of the Bcl-2 family, alongside Bcl-2 in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in comparison with reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with those from p53 and caspase-3 (apoptotic markers) and Ki67 (proliferation marker) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies showed BNIP3 to be strongly expressed in most follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> but to be weak to negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the reactive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was also an inverse relationship with Bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation of BNIP3 immunoreactivity with proliferation and caspase and p53 were virtually negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and reactive lymphoid cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BNIP3 is strongly expressed in most follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, especially those that are Bcl-2 negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BNIP3 may serve as a marker of more <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behaviour</z:hpo> in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and be useful diagnostically in the distinction from reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002840'>lymphadenitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
