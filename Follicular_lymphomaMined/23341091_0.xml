<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We employed a Hidden-Markov-Model (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="24564">HMM</z:chebi>) algorithm in loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data from Non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) entities, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This revealed a high frequency of LOH over the chromosomal region 11p11.2, containing the gene encoding the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type J (PTPRJ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although PTPRJ regulates components of key survival pathways in B-cells (i.e., BCR, MAPK, and PI3K signaling), its role in B-cell development is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LOH of PTPRJ has been described in several types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> but not in any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0848852,C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, FL cases with LOH exhibited down-regulation of PTPRJ, in contrast no significant variation of expression was shown in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, sequence screening in Exons 5 and 13 of PTPRJ identified the G973A (rs2270993), T1054C (rs2270992), A1182C (rs1566734), and G2971C (rs4752904) coding SNPs (cSNPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The A1182 allele was significantly more frequent in FLs and in NHLs with LOH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant over-representation of the C1054 (rs2270992) and the C2971 (rs4752904) alleles were also observed in LOH cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A haplotype analysis also revealed a significant lower frequency of haplotype GTCG in NHL cases, but it was only detected in cases with retention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conversely, haplotype GCAC was over-representated in cases with LOH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Altogether, these results indicate that the inactivation of PTPRJ may be a common lymphomagenic mechanism in these NHL subtypes and that haplotypes in PTPRJ gene may play a role in susceptibility to NHL, by affecting activation of PTPRJ in these B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
