<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>B cells that do not express B7 costimulatory molecules induce T-cell tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the expression of B7 costimulatory molecules on malignant B cells might be critical for their recognition by anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show that virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> germinal center (GC)-derived B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> including follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) and diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but not mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>/CLL), express B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) on their cell surface in situ, although at extremely low levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite their expression of low levels of B7-1 and B7-2, FL cells could not induce significant allogeneic T-cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, B7 costimulatory molecules on FL appeared to be functional because they were capable of increasing T-cell proliferation of preactivated T cells in a secondary allogeneic mixed lymphocyte response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, low B7 expression was sufficient to prevent the induction of alloantigen-specific anergy in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we postulate that whereas low-level expression of B7 is not sufficient to initiate a productive antilymphoma T-cell response, it might be sufficient to prevent T-cell tolerance in vivo </plain></SENT>
