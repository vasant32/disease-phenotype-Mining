<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred thirty-one patients older than 59 years with a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and poor prognosis were randomized between the association of CHVP (12 cycles in 18 months) plus interferon (5 MU TIW for 18 months) or fludarabine alone (25 mg/m2/d x 5 days for 6 cycles, then 20 mg/m2/day for 6 further cycles for 18 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Poor prognosis was defined by the presence of a large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> mass, poor performance status, the presence of B symptoms, above <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LDH level, or &gt; or = 3 mg/l beta-microglobulin level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients treated with CHVP plus interferon had a higher response to treatment, a longer time to progression and a longer survival than those treated with fludarabine alone (P &lt; 0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> analyses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 29 months, the 2-year failure-free survival was 63% for the CHVP-plus-interferon arm compared to 49% for the fludarabine arm and the two-year survival was 77% and 62%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This benefit was confirmed in a multivariate analysis including initial prognostic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fludarabine alone was associated with less <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> than CHVP plus interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interferon was decreased or stopped in 39% of the patients because of severe <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CHVP plus interferon over 18 months was associated with a better outcome, even though the combination of interferon plus chemotherapy was less well tolerated than fludarabine </plain></SENT>
