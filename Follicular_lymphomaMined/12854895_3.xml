<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients with previously untreated advanced stage indolent NHL were enrolled: follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, grade 1 (11 patients) and grade 2 (8 patients); small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (5 patients); and lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated as clinically indicated </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received induction with CHOP for 4 cycles (weeks 1, 4, 7, 10): <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 750 mg/m2 i.v., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> 50 mg/m2 i.v., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> 1.4 mg/m2 i.v </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate to CHOP was 92% (3 CR, 8 PR) and to CHOP-HC was 93% (4 CR, 8 PR) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Greater hematologic toxicity was observed with CHOP-HC resulting in an increased number of hospitalizations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
