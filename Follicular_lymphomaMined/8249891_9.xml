<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The abrupt appearance of a high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in patients with low-grade malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> usually is associated with an accelerated clinical disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> may take a variety of histologic forms and often, but not always, represents evolution of the original low-grade disease, as shown by immunophenotypic or immunogenotypic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors describe the transformation of a variety of low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> to high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The initial diagnoses included <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in one patient each and low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were classified as lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in one patient and small noncleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The high-grade component manifests primarily in the peripheral blood as circulating blast-like cells consistent with large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the remaining patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In each case, immunophenotypic studies showed identical monoclonal surface immunoglobulin expression on the low- and high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin heavy chain gene and kappa light chain gene studies showed identical clonally rearranged bands in paired samples from three of the four patients, a finding indicative of clonal identity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, dissimilar immunoglobulin light and heavy chain gene rearrangements were detected in the paired samples from one patient with previously diagnosed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, making the relationship of the two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from this patient uncertain; however, additional Southern blot analysis of the bcl-2 gene showed identical rearrangements in both lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, polymerase chain reaction across the t(14;18) major breakpoint region in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> amplified nucleotide fragments of identical size, confirming the clonal identity of the low- and high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> despite the divergent immunoglobulin gene studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These studies show that low-grade malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of small lymphocytic, mantle cell, or follicular small cleaved cell types may assume high-grade morphologic characteristics, that this change is the result of transformation of the preexisting low-grade malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, and that this progression, like typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0349631" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Richter's syndrome</z:e>, is associated with a dramatically accelerated clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, these studies confirm previous reports that disparate immunoglobulin light and heavy chain gene rearrangements are not necessarily an indicator of different cellular origins, and additional genotypic studies occasionally may be required to show the clonal identity of the cell population involved in these morphologic transformations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
