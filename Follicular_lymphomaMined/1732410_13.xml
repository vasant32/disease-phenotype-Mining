<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells are found in close association with follicular T lymphocytes and dendritic cells, suggesting that the surrounding cells may play a role in the support of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0474808" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">follicular tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Supernatants from activated human peripheral blood lymphocytes were found to promote the in vitro proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0474808" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">follicular tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This effect was entirely due to interleukin 3 (IL-3), a factor generally thought to cause the growth and differentiation of immature hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IL-3 receptors were detected on fresh isolates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> primary follicular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that follicular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> may be dependent in vivo on IL-3 and that therapies directed against IL-3, its receptor, or the T cells that produce it may be effective treatment for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
