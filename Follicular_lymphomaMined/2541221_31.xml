<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To study the biology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175816" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cold agglutinin disease</z:e> we previously established EBV-transformed B cell clones isolated from a patient with splenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of an early plasmacytic cell type and immune <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> due to an anti-Pr2 cold agglutinin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These clones had an aberrant chromosomal marker identical to the patient's B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and each secreted IgMk anti-Pr2 similar to the pathologic autoantibody in the serum of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have further investigated the Pr2-specific <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp> through nucleotide sequencing of VH and VL region genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have shown that the seven clones share the same VDJ/VJ gene segments and junctional elements confirming their clonal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The VH sequences were 88% homologous to a VHI germline gene while the VL sequences were 97% homologous to a VkIII germline gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> (3 silent and 1 conservative) were found in greater than 5,000 bp sequenced, suggesting that a low mutation rate existed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> mass of 10(12) cells and a minimum of 40 divisions, we estimated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> rate to be 4.45 x 10(-5) m/bp/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> rate is similar to those estimated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (pre-B cell) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (intermediate B cell), but significantly lower than the mutation frequency in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (activated B cell) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that the difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> frequency of a B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> may be related to the stage of B cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, the low mutation frequency observed in the Pr2-specific B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> may also reflect, in part, selection by autoantigen to conserve sIg structure and specificity </plain></SENT>
