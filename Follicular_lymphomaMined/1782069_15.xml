<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Distribution of stages was: 72 I, 61 II, 83 III and 65 IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within stage III, two subgroups were retrospectively defined: stages III1 (32 cases) included patients with less than 8 involved sites, only 1 or 2 above diaphragm, and no spleen or mediastinal enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stage III2 (51 cases) included the remaining stage III cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complete remission (CR) rate was 82% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>10-year overall survival (OS) and time to treatment failure (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi>) rates were, respectively 38% and 29.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>10-year time to relapse (TTR) rate was 36% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses showed concordant results with two main prognostic factors: age (less than 60/greater than 60) and stage (I to III1/III2 and IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age was the most important factor for OS analysis and stage for CR and TTR analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This leads to only three prognostic groups with different outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The first includes younger patients (less than 60 years) with limited stages (less than or equal to III1); the second, patients either older than 60 or with advanced stages; the last, elderly patients with advanced stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CR rates of these three groups were, respectively 97%, 75% and 57% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>10-year OS were, respectively 73.5%, 27% and 0%; 10-year TTR were 54%, 22% and 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results have lead to data which are easy to handle and which can help to establish a rationale for further prospective trials </plain></SENT>
