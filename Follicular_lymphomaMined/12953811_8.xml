<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is categorized as low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> because of the long median survival, but the disease is difficult to cure because of frequent recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18)(q32;q21) associated with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> juxtaposes a portion of BCL-2 (18q21) and IGH(14q32); the result is bcl-2 overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, a highly sensitive 2-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method was used to detect t(14;18)(q32;q21) in the nuclei of paraffin-embedded tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen specimens, including 11 samples from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 3 samples from diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, for which results of karyotype study and paraffin-embedded tissues were available were selected for FISH study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The FISH results were compared with results of karyotype study of the lymph nodes involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among our 11 patients with the diagnosis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in whom karyotype study was performed, 8 had t(14;18)(q32;q21) in karyotype analysis, and 7 of these patients had a positive pattern in FISH analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 1 case, FISH analysis was difficult because of weak signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 patients with diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and t(14;18)(q32;q21) in karyotype analysis had a positive pattern in FISH analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 3 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> without t(14;18)(q32;q21) in karyotype analysis, FISH did not show a positive pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore the FISH assay in tissue was found to be very sensitive in detection of IGH/BCL2 translocation and was helpful in diagnosis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or in clarification of the cell origin of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> when karyotype analysis was not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Performing FISH on paraffin sections also is useful because we can identify cells with genetic abnormalities in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and make a retrospective cytogenetic diagnosis even with old paraffin-embedded specimens </plain></SENT>
