<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine whether autologous (auto) or allogeneic (allo) stem-cell transplantation (SCT) improves outcome in patients with transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> compared with rituximab-containing chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a multicenter cohort study of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and subsequent biopsy-proven aggressive histology transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient, treatment, and outcome data were collected from each transplantation center and combined for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A separate control group was composed of patients with transformation treated with rituximab-containing chemotherapy but not SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was overall survival (OS) after transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred seventy-two patients were identified: 22 (13%) treated with alloSCT, 97 (56%) with autoSCT, and 53 (31%) with rituximab-containing chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five-year OS after transformation was 46% for patients treated with alloSCT, 65% with autoSCT, and 61% with rituximab-containing chemotherapy (P = .24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five-year progression-free survival (PFS) after transformation was 46% for those treated with alloSCT, 55% with autoSCT, and 40% with rituximab-containing chemotherapy (P = .12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, patients treated with autoSCT had improved OS compared with those who received rituximab-containing chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.13; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.34; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, there was no OS difference between those treated with alloSCT and rituximab-containing chemotherapy (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.16 to 1.24; P = .12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>OS and PFS after SCT were similar between those treated with autoSCT and alloSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five-year transplantation-related mortality was 23% for those treated with alloSCT and 5% for autoSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing autoSCT had better outcomes than those treated with rituximab-containing chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>AlloSCT did not improve outcome compared with rituximab-containing chemotherapy and was associated with clinically significant toxicity </plain></SENT>
