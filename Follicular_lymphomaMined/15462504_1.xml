<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe two elderly patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) involving the skin and superficial soft tissues, with a striking proliferation of follicular dendritic cells (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, one patient had bone marrow involvement by FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histopathologically, the most remarkable feature in both cases seen at low magnification was a striking <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo> of the constituent cells, which were arranged in fascicles, whorls, and round islands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of the cells had the typical cytologic features of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were intimately intermingled with centroblasts and centrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A large amount of the clear cytoplasm and the pale nuclei of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi>, which predominated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, caused the striking overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo> of the lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Small reactive lymphocytes were scattered between the fascicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A vague follicular growth pattern was seen only focally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mantle zones were markedly reduced or absent so that the follicles were seen lying unseparated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The close intermixture of the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> and the germinal center cells was responsible for the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> appearing to be decorated with B-associated marker, and the germinal center cells seemed to be stained to some degree with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi>-markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> bulk demonstrated a diffuse and strong reaction with CD10, CD20, CD21, CD35, and stained weakly with CD79a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fascin and CD23 showed only a weak and focal staining pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 decorated large centroblasts and small reactive T-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> bulk was negative for actin, EMA, cytokeratins, vimentin, desmin, and factor XIIIa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The proliferative index was rather low; MIB-1 mainly decorated large centroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No monoclonal rearrangement of IgH genes was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus was not identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy revealed typical features of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> intermingled with germinal center cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Such cases may represent a diagnostic pitfall, as <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> can mask FL and give the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> the appearance of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>We believe that, in both cases, the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> proliferation had a reactive character </plain></SENT>
