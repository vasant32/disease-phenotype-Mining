<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether they are truly of follicular center cell origin, have a molecular pathogenesis similar to nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, or have any biologic features that distinguish them from secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> involving skin remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address these issues, a retrospective multiparameter study of 25 patients including clinical, histologic, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic analyses was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A classic CD10+, bcl-6+ follicular center cell profile was found in 10 (40%) cutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (2 of 11 primary, 5 of 8 secondary, 3 of 6 unclassified) with bcl-2 expression seen only in the nonprimary cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining cases, 14 cases (56%) were CD10-, bcl-6+, bcl-2+/- (9 primary) and one case (4%) was CD10-, bcl-6-, bcl-2+ (0 primary) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed a t(14;18) in 0 of 9 primary and 3 of 5 secondary cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary cases were frequently found in the head/neck region, whereas secondary cases were more common on the trunk and extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> alive, usually having received only local therapy, at a median follow-up of 19 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most secondary cases were treated with chemotherapy with only one untreated patient dead of disease at a median follow-up of 5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Primary cutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> therefore appear to be distinctive as they have fewer features of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> than do secondary cases </plain></SENT>
