<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An outcome of low-grade B cell non-Hodgkins's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is the transformation to high-grade diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DLBL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> in the transformation to DLBL, we performed longitudinal molecular analyses of immunoglobulin (Ig), V(H)DJ(H) gene sequences expressed in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>), and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) that transformed to DLBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the neoplastic CLL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e> cells and their respective high-grade transformants, there was no evidence for a clonotypic shift or acquired mutations in the expressed Ig V(H)DJ(H) gene segments, as further confirmed by a specific and sensitive PCR-single strand polymorphism analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, among the FL cells there was a high degree of intraclonal diversification with highly divergent V(H)DJ(H) gene sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite this intraclonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, the related DLBL expressed a collinear but unique V(H)DJ(H) gene sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intraclonal genealogical tree for the FL case demonstrated that the DLBL emerged in association with unique V(H)DJ(H) gene mutational events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the intraclonal FL and related DLBL transformants, the nature and distribution of the Ig V(H)DJ(H) gene mutations were consistent with antigenic selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> in the transformation from low- to high-grade B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> may involve distinct pathways which vary according to the cellular origin and the type of the progenitor B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
