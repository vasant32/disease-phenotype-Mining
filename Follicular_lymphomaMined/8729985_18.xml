<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2 protein, which protects cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, is normally expressed in a number of adult tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dysregulated bcl-2 expression, secondary to (14;18) chromosomal translocation, seems to promote the development of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and recent findings of bcl-2 protein in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> suggest that it might contribute to the genesis of many other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>bcl-2 is also highly expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> proliferative endometrium and markedly down-regulated in secretory endometrium, which suggests that its expression is <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because the development of most <z:hpo ids='HP_0012114'>endometrial carcinomas</z:hpo> is associated with hyperestrogenic states, we began the investigation of the role of bcl-2 in endometrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> by immunohistochemically quantifying its expression in proliferative, hyperplastic, atypically hyperplastic, and carcinomatous endometrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of this study show that bcl-2 is relatively highly expressed in proliferative (n = 11) and hyperplastic (n = 18) endometrium, with respective mean staining scores of 3.59 and 3.47 (scale, 0-4), but is significantly (P &lt; 0.001) down-regulated in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_483'>atypical hyperplasia</z:mpath> (n = 11; score, 0.82), and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n = 34; score, 0.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>bcl-2 expression did not correlate with stage, grade, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-receptor, or <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi>-receptor expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction analyses of DNA isolated from several <z:hpo ids='HP_0012114'>endometrial carcinomas</z:hpo> were negative for (14;18) translocation involving the bcl-2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, bcl-2 apparently plays no role in the progression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_483'>atypical hyperplasia</z:mpath> to <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> or in the development of high-grade or advanced-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0012114'>endometrial carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results, however, do not rule out the involvement of bcl-2 in very early, preatypical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> phases of endometrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, the marked difference in bcl-2 expression in hyperplastic and atypically hyperplastic glands might prove to be diagnostically useful in the often difficult distinction of these entities </plain></SENT>
