<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CD45 is a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lymphohemopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its expression increases during B-lymphocyte ontogeny </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Few data are available about CD45 expression in the various types of low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Low levels of CD45 have been reported in pathologic lymphocytes from typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) and higher levels of this antigen have been observed in some cases of atypical CLL and in some cases of other types of NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred and seven bone marrow samples of NHL with bone marrow infiltration were investigated: 45 typical CLL, 15 atypical CLL, 9 mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>), 1 MCL with CD23 expression, 18 marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>), 6 lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (LPL), 6 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL), and 7 hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (HCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD45 expression was evaluated by flow cytometry: pathologic lymphocytes were identified on the basis of specific immunophenotypic profile, CD19/K or CD19/lambda co-expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results were expressed as median fluorescence intensity (MFI) along a 1024 linear scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD45 expression was measured also on autologous T-lymphocytes and a "CD45 index" was calculated as the ratio MFI of pathologic B-lymphocytes/MFI of T-lymphocytes, to normalize the results obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found four CD45 expression patterns: very low in typical CLL; relatively low in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>; intermediate intensity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>, LPL, and FL; very high expression in HCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the atypical cases, very high CD45 expression was found in one case of CD23-negative CLL, in CD23-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, and CLL with atypical <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results indicate different levels of maturation in low-grade NHL and may help to characterize such <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
