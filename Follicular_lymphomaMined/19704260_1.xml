<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCLs</z:e>) are associated with a characteristic t(11;14)(q13;q32) chromosomal translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This causes the CCND1 gene on chromosome 11 to be co-localized with the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene on chromosome 14, resulting in increased expression of cyclin D1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cyclin D1/D3 expression ratio, as an approach to segregate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCLs</z:e> from other small B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, has not previously been evaluated in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that mean cyclin D3 expression was lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCLs</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05) than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo> (CLLs), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs), marginal zone/mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (MALTs), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myelomas</z:hpo> (MMs), and reactive lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As expected, mean cyclin D1 expression was increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05), but in several cases the expression of cyclin D1 did overlap with the level observed in CLLs, FLs, MALTs, MMs, and reactive lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cyclin D1/D3 expression ratio, however, did fully separate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCLs</z:e> from FLs, CLLs, and reactive lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean expression ratio was also significantly different between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> and MALT (P &lt; 0.05), but 3 MCL cases had values overlapping those of some MALTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression ratio was not significantly different between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> and MM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the cyclin D1/D3 expression ratio gave an improved segregation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCLs</z:e> from CLLs, FLs, MALTs, and reactive lymph nodes, as compared with determination of cyclin D1 alone in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue </plain></SENT>
