<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of the bcl-2 protein seems to be important for the pathogenesis of follicular center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, in which both protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> usually show high levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the expression of the Epstein-Barr virus-encoded late membrane protein up-regulates the bcl-2 protein in cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to investigate the expression of the bcl-2 oncogene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> both at the protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level in correlation with the expression of the late membrane protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirteen cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> histologic types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, six cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> nonspecific <z:hpo ids='HP_0002840'>lymphadenitis</z:hpo>, three tonsils with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo>, seven cases of follicular small cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and six cases of follicular large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We designed a novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42098">digoxigenin</z:chebi>-labeled oligonucleotide probe complementary to bcl-2 mRNA for nonisotopic in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 oncoprotein and late membrane protein expression were determined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of the 14;18 translocation was analyzed by PCR for the major breakpoint region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The main finding was that, irrespective of subtype, the vast majority of Hodgkin cells express abundant bcl-2 mRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Oncoprotein expression, however, varied from case to case, with the highest prevalence in the nodular sclerosing subtype, and showed no strict correlation with the late membrane protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In our case, no 14;18 translocation could be found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hodgkin cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> demonstrated high levels of bcl-2 mRNA, while the bcl-2 protein expression was inhomogenous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In nodular lymphocyte predominant type, the bcl-2 mRNA and protein pattern is comparable to germinal center cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This finding is a further argument for the germinal center cell origin of this type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
