<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complete remissions occurred in 68% with CVP and 48% with C-V-P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For patients with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the complete remission rate was 81% with CVP and 46% with C-V-P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> a complete remission rate of 50% was obtained with both regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median duration of response was longer for patients who obtained complete remission with CVP (37+ months) than for those entering remission with C-V-P (25+ months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More patients treated with CVP still survive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Current results suggest that CVP is a better induction regime than C-V-P in patients with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in patients with diffuse lympoocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, neither regimen results in more than 50% complete remissions or significant numbers of prolonged responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More effective therapy is needed </plain></SENT>
