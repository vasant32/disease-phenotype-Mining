<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Manual histological grading of FL is subject to remarkable inter- and intra-reader variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A promising approach to grading is the development of a computer-assisted system that improves consistency and precision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlating information from adjacent slides with different stain types requires establishing spatial correspondences between the digitized section pair through a precise non-rigid image registration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the dissimilar appearances of the different stain types challenges existing registration methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study proposes a method for the automatic non-rigid registration of histological section images with different stain types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This method is based on matching high level features that are representative of small anatomical structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This choice of feature provides a rich matching environment, but also results in a high mismatch probability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Matching confidence is increased by establishing local groups of coherent features through geometric reasoning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The proposed method is validated on a set of FL images representing different disease stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis demonstrates that given a proper feature set the accuracy of automatic registration is comparable to manual registration </plain></SENT>
