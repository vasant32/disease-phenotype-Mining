<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the mechanisms of the diffuse evolution of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we investigated the expression pattern of CD44 in 28 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs) using an immunohistochemical method and semi-quantitative PCR-Southern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The FLs were divided into four groups: i) intrafollicular (IF); ii) infiltrative (INF); iii) partially follicular (PF); and iv) minimally follicular (MF), according to the histological classification by Lukes and Collins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of CD44 using antibodies against CD44 common (CD44C) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> showed that CD44 was expressed in the diffuse area in the INF (0/8 cases), PF (12/12 cases), and MF (2/2 cases) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, whereas CD44 was not expressed in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells within the area of follicular growth of IF (0/6 cases) and INF (0/8 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Semi-quantitative PCR-Southern blot analysis showed that CD19-selected B cells from the FLs were expressed as a product of 482 base pairs (bp) corresponding to a CD44 standard form (CD44s) (5/5 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells from the PF were expressed as products of 600 and 1100 bp and the cells from MF were expressed as products of 600, 900, and 1100 bp with the CD44 exon 10 or 11 probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that the expression of CD44s and CD44 variants containing exon 10 and 11 were up-regulated according to the diffuse evolution of the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
