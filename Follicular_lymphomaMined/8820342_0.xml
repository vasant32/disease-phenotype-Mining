<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Light microscopy revealed that three cases consisted of diffuse neoplastic proliferation of medium-sized lymphocytes (diffuse) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, medium-sized cell type), while the remaining one showed follicular neoplastic proliferation of medium-sized lymphocytes (follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, medium-sized cell type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that most of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in three cases had weak to moderate immunoreactivity for L26 and weak reactivity for IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in one case showed weak reactivity for IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in three cases had weak reactivity for vimentin, and some in two cases showed weak positivity for KP1 and PG-M1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural examination revealed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four cases contained large nuclei with clear nucleoli and scant cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most of the intercellular junctions were smooth, but in one case, some areas exhibited desmosomes </plain></SENT>
