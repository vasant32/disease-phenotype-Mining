<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: High amounts of intratumoral macrophages have been shown to correlate with poor prognosis in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) treated with chemotherapy without rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tried to establish whether intratumoral macrophage count (MC) definitely is able to predict the outcome of FL patients in the rituximab era </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed immunohistochemical CD68 expression in 194 FL patients from the FL-2000 trial, randomly assigned to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>, and interferon (CHVP-I) or rituximab plus CHVP-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin sections using anti-CD68 KP1 antibody, and stained macrophages were scored on high-power field (hpf) in either intrafollicular (IF) or extrafollicular (EF) areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For IF MC, the best cutoff point was estimated at 10 macrophages/hpf </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low IF MC was significantly associated with a better event-free survival (EFS; P = .011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, this effect was observed only in the CHVP-I arm (P = .012) and not in the rituximab plus CHVP-I arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using a cutoff of 15 IF MC, we found no significant association with EFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For EF MC, fewer than 22 macrophages/hpf were associated with better EFS in the CHVP-I arm (P = .02) but not in the rituximab plus CHVP-I arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results show that MC can predict outcome of FL patients and that rituximab is able to circumvent the unfavorable outcome associated with high MC </plain></SENT>
