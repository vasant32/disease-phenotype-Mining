<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A population-based case-control study was undertaken in 2000-2001 using detailed methods of assessing occupational <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cases with incident non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in two Australian states (n = 694) and controls (n = 694) were chosen from Australian electoral rolls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to estimate the risks of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> associated with exposure to subgroups of pesticides after adjustment for age, sex, ethnic origin, and residence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Approximately 10% of cases and controls had incurred <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Substantial exposure to any <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> was associated with a trebling of the risk of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (odds ratio = 3.09, 95% confidence interval: 1.42, 6.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects with substantial exposure to organochlorines, organophosphates, and "other pesticides" (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other pesticides excluding <z:chebi fb="95" ids="24527">herbicides</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="95" ids="24527">herbicides</z:chebi> other than phenoxy <z:chebi fb="95" ids="24527">herbicides</z:chebi> had similarly increased risks, although the increase was statistically significant only for "other pesticides." None of the exposure metrics (probability, level, frequency, duration, or years of exposure) were associated with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analyses of the major World Health Organization subtypes of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> suggested a stronger effect for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These increases in risk of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with substantial occupational <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> exposure are consistent with previous work </plain></SENT>
