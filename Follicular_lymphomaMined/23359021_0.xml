<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Healthy radio-exposed individuals who received low levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30514">Cesium</z:chebi>-137 radiation during the accident that occurred in Goi√¢nia in 1987, their families and controls were tested for the detection of t(14;18)-rearranged B cells in peripheral blood by using a highly sensitive, real-time quantitative PCR method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The chromosomal translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21) is characteristic of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and is a frequent abnormality observed in other types of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This translocation leads to constitutive activation of the BCL2 oncogene by the enhancers of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In healthy individuals, the same translocation may also be found in a small fraction of peripheral blood lymphocytes, and positive cells might serve as an indicator for environmental exposure to carcinogens and possibly correlate with the cumulative risk of developing t(14;18)- positive non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty healthy radio-exposed individuals, 10 relatives and 10 non-exposed healthy individuals were tested for the detection of this translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 1 non-exposed individual was positive for the chromosomal translocation, and healthy radio-exposed individuals presented lower levels of cells bearing the BCL2/J(H) rearrangement when compared to the levels of the patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, evaluation of more cells would be required to confirm the total absence of circulating cells bearing BCL2/J(H) rearrangement </plain></SENT>
