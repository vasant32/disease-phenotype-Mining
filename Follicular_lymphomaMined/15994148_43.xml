<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This multicenter, dose-escalation study evaluates the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of galiximab (anti-CD80 monoclonal antibody) in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients had follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that had relapsed or failed to respond to primary therapy; the majority (90%) presented with stage III or IV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four weekly intravenous infusions of galiximab were administered at doses of 125, 250, 375, or 500 mg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients received galiximab treatment and were evaluated for safety; 35 were assessable for response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antibody infusions were safe and well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 22 (60%) of 37 patients experienced adverse events related to galiximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one of the events were grade 1 or 2; the most common were <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytopenias were rare; only one patient experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, which were unrelated to galiximab and resolved after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patient developed antigaliximab antibody formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean serum half-life ranged from 13 to 24 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 11% (two complete responses and two partial responses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Time to best response was delayed (months 3, 6, 9, and 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients (34%) maintained stable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nearly half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (49%) had a decrease in indicator lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Two responders remain on study without progression (22 and 24.4 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The favorable safety profile of galiximab and evidence of single-agent biologic activity and dose-dependent pharmacokinetics support further evaluation of galiximab as a treatment for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, possibly in combination with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> therapies </plain></SENT>
