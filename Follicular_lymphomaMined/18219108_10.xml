<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Protein profiling of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> biopsies may be of potential value for use in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> classification and the discovery of novel markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have optimized a method for SELDI-TOF MS based protein profiling of frozen tissue sections, without dissection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First we have compared chip surfaces and lysis buffers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, we have determined the minimal input using laser dissection microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, we have analyzed and compared protein profiles of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=8), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=8) and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Benign, reactive lymph nodes (n=14) were used as a reference group.CM10 chip surface in combination with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> lysis buffer and an input of approximately 50,000 lymphocytes allowed the detection of many differential peaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Identification of the diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases was reliably made in the supervised classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unsupervised clustering showed segregation into a benign/indolent cluster predominantly formed by benign, reactive lymph nodes and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases and into a more aggressive cluster formed by diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our protocol enables protein profiling of protein lysates derived from small histological samples and the subsequent detection of many differentially expressed proteins, without the need of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results support further evaluation of protein profiling of small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> biopsies as an additional tool in pathology </plain></SENT>
