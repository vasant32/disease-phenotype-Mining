<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is generally responsive to conventional-dose chemotherapy, improved survival in patients with this disease has been difficult to demonstrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High-dose chemo/radiotherapy followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) can improve response rates, although its effects on survival remain controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between 1990 and 2003, we transplanted 49 patients with low-grade FL at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients (45%) had undergone histologic transformation at the time of ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 44 patients (90%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relapsed disease</z:e> and five patients (10%) were resistant to chemotherapy at the time of transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After ASCT, 30 patients (61%) were in complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival (OS) has not been reached, while the median event-free survival (EFS) is 2.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 5.5 years (longest 12.4 years), a plateau has been reached with 56% of patients remaining alive, and 35% event-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ASCT was well tolerated except for two (4%) treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, CR after ASCT and age less than 60 years are the best predictors of EFS and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ASCT is thus a safe therapeutic approach in FL, resulting in long-term EFS and OS for some patients, even with transformed disease </plain></SENT>
