<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) in situ (FLIS) was first described and proposed as a distinct entity associated with an indolent clinical course in 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To gain further insight into the biology of this enigmatic lymphoproliferation, we analyzed morphologic, phenotypic, cytogenetic and molecular features of tissue specimens manifesting a pattern of follicular colonization by Bcl-2(bright+)CD10(+) B-cells and associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> from 13 adults and evaluated their clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We observed this immunoarchitectural pattern in lymph nodes (n = 9), at extranodal sites (n = 5), or at both locations (n = 1) at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> except 3 cases showed concomitant bright CD10 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six (46%) patients had synchronous and 2 (15%) developed metachronous B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, with 5 representing high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Bcl-2(bright+)CD10(+) B-cells colonizing reactive follicles and synchronous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were clonally related in 4/5 (80%) cases analyzed and 5/6 (83%) displayed BCL2 translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two cases exhibited complex karyotypes in both components; a genetic "triple hit" was detected in one instance and 2 copies of t(14,18) were observed in a lymph node biopsy lacking evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from an individual with stage 4 disease, suspected on imaging, who subsequently displayed a mantle zone/perifollicular infiltrate of Bcl-2(bright+)CD10(+) B-cells in the adenoids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that bright Bcl-2, and often bright CD10 expression, by B-cells colonizing reactive follicles might represent a phenomenon related to follicular homing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, rather than being an attribute of preneoplastic FL precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, due to the relatively high frequency of overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> observed, complete staging workup is recommended for patients exhibiting a Bcl-2(bright+)CD10(+) B-cell follicular colonization pattern on biopsy </plain></SENT>
