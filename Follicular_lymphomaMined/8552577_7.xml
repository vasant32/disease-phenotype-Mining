<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although bcl-2 has been shown to be involved in the development of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> via a chromosomal translocation t(14;18), little is known about its function in non-hematolymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2 protein is normally expressed in the regenerative crypt compartment of the colon, small intestine, and stomach, and has been found to be abnormally overexpressed as an early event in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequences of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>-related and gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to evaluate the role of bcl-2 in the Barrett's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six esophageal resection specimens were studied, using a monoclonal antibody to the bcl-2 protein on fixed paraffin-embedded specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Barrett's mucosa was present in each specimen: low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 35, high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in 34, intramucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (IMC) in 23, and submucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, a section of the gastric resection margin was evaluated for bcl-2 immunoreactivity in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the regenerative compartment of the gastric mucosa in the resection margins stained for bcl-2; however, no immunoreactivity was seen in any of the cases of Barrett's mucosa with or without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, in contrast to its role in gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, bcl-2 alterations are not an important molecular marker in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> of Barrett's mucosa </plain></SENT>
