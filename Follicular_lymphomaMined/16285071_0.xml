<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For patients who relapse, rituximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD20 receptors on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells, induces remissions lasting at least 9 months in about 50% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the infusions are often poorly tolerated and reactions can be severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2) Ibritumomab is a monoclonal antibody similar to rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is not in itself cytotoxic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">Yttrium</z:chebi>-90-radiolabeled ibritumomab has been licensed in the EU since 2004 for local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> radiotherapy, administered shortly after rituximab therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is approved as a third-line treatment for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, after rituximab failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(3) The only available comparative trial, lasting 4 years, involved 143 patients who were treated either with rituximab followed by radiolabeled ibritumomab, or with rituximab alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sequential treatment yielded more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> responses but the time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> progression and clinical outcomes did not differ between the two treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(4) In a non comparative trial about half the patients in whom rituximab had failed responded to rituximab + radiolabeled ibritumomab, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> progression occurred after a median of only 7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(5) Patients who receive sequential therapy with rituximab + ibritumomab are exposed to the adverse effects of rituximab plus supplementary gastrointestinal, respiratory, haematological and infectious risks, mainly due to persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>(6) The radiation hazard for the patient (irradiation of healthy organs) and for the environment appears to be limited, because of the short reach of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="10545">beta particle</z:chebi> emission (5 mm) and the short half-life of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">yttrium</z:chebi> 90 (2.7 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(7) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">Yttrium</z:chebi> 90 radiolabeling requires special equipment and specialised personnel working in an approved centre, which can restrict access to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>(8) Radiolabeled ibritumomab appears to have a negative risk-benefit balance, and should only be used in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
