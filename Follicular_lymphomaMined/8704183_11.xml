<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The product of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressor gene (pRB), a nuclear phosphoprotein that regulates transcription factors such as E2F, is involved in cell cycle control and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its activity is regulated by phosphorylation; the underphosphorylated form inhibits transcription whereas the highly phosphorylated form is inactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cyclin D1 and its associated kinase (CDK 4/6) phosphorylate pRB in vitro, and therefore are thought to contribute to the regulation of pRB function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To examine the effect of cyclin D1 overexpression on pRB in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> tissue, we studied pRB expression in low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, with particular regard to mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which is characterized by cyclin D1 (bcl-1) overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>pRB expression was studied by immunostaining with a well-characterized anti-pRB antibody; the phosphorylation status of pRB was examined by immunoblots; and the functional binding capacity of pRB was examined by in vitro binding to adenovirus E1A protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We studied 3 reactive lymph nodes, 28 low grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 4 cases of hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (HCL) and 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reactive lymph nodes showed intense pRB staining of germinal centers, with strongest (2+) staining in the large cells (centroblasts) of the proliferating (dark) zone and weak or no staining of small lymphocytes, including those of the mantle zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (B-CLL) (4 cases), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (3 cases) and mucosa-associated (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (3 cases) strong (2+) pRB staining was limited to centroblasts in reactive and neoplastic follicles and occasional proliferation centers, with only faint staining of small lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 15 of 16 cases of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed strong (1-2+) staining of most cells; one blastoid mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed only faint pRB staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases of (HCL) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> showed strong pRB staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although most <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with strong pRB expression were cyclin D1(+), three cyclin D1(+) cases showed only weak pRB expression (1 B-CLL, 1 blastoid mantle cell, 1 unclassifiable low grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conversely, of the 4 pRB(+) HCLs and 3 pRB(+) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo>, only 1 of each was cyclin D1(+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>pRB appeared to exist primarily in the underphosphorylated (fastest migrating) form on Western blot, despite the fact that cyclin D1 was complexed to CDK4, a form in which it normally phosphorylates pRB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, pRB appeared to be unmutated, because it bound normally to the adenovirus E1A protein and showed nuclear localization by immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We conclude that most cases of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, HCL, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> show high levels of pRB in contrast to follicle center <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; however, pRB expression does not appear to be consistently related to cyclin D1 overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The pRB appears to be unmutated and underphosphorylated, and therefore should be in its active form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our data from primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissue suggests that overexpression of cyclin D1, whereas tumorigenic, does not lead to pRB loss or hyperphosporylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Thus, the mechanism by which cyclin D1 contributes to <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and the significance of the restricted expression of pRB in low-grade lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> remain to be determined </plain></SENT>
