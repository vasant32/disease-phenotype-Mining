<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The absence of a pFL-1 homologous transcript in a cell line containing a pFL-2-detectable translocation suggests that there may be two different pathogenetic consequences of t(14;18) translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One possibility is that, despite the distances between them (greater than 20 kb), breakpoints in the two cluster regions in some way affect transcription of the same gene product, which has not yet been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, two separate transcriptional units may be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The availability of DNA probes for each of the two t(14;18) breakpoint cluster regions will allow further studies regarding the biologic significance of these two genetically distinct classes of t(14;18) translocations </plain></SENT>
