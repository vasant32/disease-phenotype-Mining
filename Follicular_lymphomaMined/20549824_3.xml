<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty patients were enrolled who had received a maximum of 2 previous regimens, including 1 cyclophosphamide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHOP)/CHOP-like regimen but no previous exposure to rituximab, fludarabine, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline, 58% of patients had bulky disease (lesion &gt; 7 cm), 56% had high-risk Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) scores (range, 3-5), and 22% were refractory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of 4 courses of R-FM (rituximab 375 mg/m(2) intravenously on Day 1, fludarabine 25 mg/m(2) intravenously on Days 2 through 4, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> 10 mg/m(2) intravenously on Day 2, recycling at Day 28) and consolidation with 2 courses of fludarabine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> (the same regimen without rituximab) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The best response (84% overall response rate including 68% complete response/complete response unconfirmed) was achieved after 4 courses of R-FM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Response rates were high regardless of age, refractoriness to last previous therapy, and FLIPI score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 4 years, the 3-year progression-free survival rate was 47%, the event-free survival rate was 41%, and the 3-year overall survival rate was 66% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Grade â‰¥ 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were the most common toxicities and occurred in 72% and 14% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cytoreduction with 4 courses of R-FM was safe and highly efficient in patients with recurrent/refractory follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who had high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden; however, better consolidation than FM is needed to further improve outcome </plain></SENT>
