<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IgH gene clonal rearrangements were retrospectively analyzed in a total of 77 diagnostically difficult B-cell lympho-proliferative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Standardized BIOMED-2 system IgH gene clonality assay kit targeting FR1, FR2, FR3 was used, followed by heteroduplex-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="32130">silver nitrate</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The final diagnoses of the 77 cases were: 12 cases of reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp>, 20 cases of atypical <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> or suspicious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 45 cases of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Detection rates of at least one positive reaction were 2/12, 11/20 (55%), 36/45 (80%) in the three groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the clonality detection rate of FR1, FR2 and FR3 was 60% (27/45), 60% (27/45) and 56% (25/45), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The type distribution were: 20 marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including 18 extranodal marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, 7 diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 7 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 1 mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 1 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 4 plasma cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and 5 unclassified B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rearrangements of FR1, FR2 or FR3 were not detected in 9 (20%) of the B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases, nevertheless, one of them had developed liver lesion later, and was confirmed finally to be B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients of reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> with positive IgH gene clonal rearrangements, and atypical <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> had follow-up history available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four of them were diagnosed as lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> upon further biopsy, and in three of them, clonal IgH gene rearrangements were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> requiring a detection of clonal IgH gene rearrangement for making a final diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Combined detections of three IgH FR1, FR2 and FR3 rearrangements provide important ancillary diagnostic value in confirming suspected B-cell lympho-proliferative disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is important to take an additional biopsy or to follow-up those patients who that have a detectable IgH gene clonal rearrangement but without apparent morphological evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For cases with a negative IgH gene rearrangements, it might be necessary to perform clonality analysis for other forms of gene rearrangements including IgH or IgK and IgL in order to further improve the detection sensitivity </plain></SENT>
