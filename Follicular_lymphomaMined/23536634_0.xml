<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the nature of the Ag(s) recognized by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> BCRs has not been well studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used unbiased approaches to demonstrate that 42 (19.35%) of 217 tested FL Igs recognized vimentin as a shared autoantigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> was localized to the N-terminal region of vimentin for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> vimentin-reactive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> Igs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We confirmed specific binding to vimentin by using recombinant vimentin and by performing competitive inhibition studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, using indirect immunofluorescence staining, we showed that the vimentin-reactive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> Igs colocalized with an anti-vimentin mAb in HEp-2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reactivity to N-terminal vimentin of IgG FL Igs was significantly higher than that of IgM FL Igs (30.4 versus 10%; p = 0.0022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, vimentin-reactive FL Igs did not share CDR3 motifs and were not homologous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vimentin was expressed in the T cell-rich regions of FL, suggesting that vimentin is available for binding with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> BCRs within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vimentin was also frequently recognized by mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> Igs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that vimentin is a shared autoantigen recognized by nonstereotyped FL BCRs and by the Igs of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> and suggest that vimentin may play a role in the pathogenesis of multiple B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings may lead to a better understanding of the biology and natural history of FL and other B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
