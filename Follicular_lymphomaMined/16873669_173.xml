<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 465 patients were randomized to induction with 6 cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHOP) (every 3 weeks) or R-CHOP (R: 375 mg/m(2) intravenously, day 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Those in complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) were randomized to maintenance with R (375 mg/m(2) intravenously once every 3 months for a maximum of 2 years) or observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>R-CHOP induction yielded an increased overall response rate (CHOP, 72.3%; R-CHOP, 85.1%; P &lt; .001) and CR rate (CHOP, 15.6%; R-CHOP, 29.5%; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival (PFS) from first randomization was 20.2 months after CHOP versus 33.1 months after R-CHOP (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rituximab maintenance yielded a median PFS from second randomization of 51.5 months versus 14.9 months with observation (HR, 0.40; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Improved PFS was found both after induction with CHOP (HR, 0.30; P &lt; .001) and R-CHOP (HR, 0.54; P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>R maintenance also improved overall survival from second randomization: 85% at 3 years versus 77% with observation (HR, 0.52; P = .011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first trial showing that in relapsed/resistant FL rituximab maintenance considerably improves PFS not only after CHOP but also after R-CHOP induction </plain></SENT>
