<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relative incidence of these subtypes of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is also known to differ according to geographic location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to clarify the current status of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in Japan and the relative incidences of their subtypes, 3194 patients were classified according to the new World Health Organization (WHO) classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among these were 3025 cases (94.71%) of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (2189 cases (68.53%) of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 796 cases (24.92%) of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) and 141 cases (4.41%) of Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidences of the major subtypes of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were 33.34% for diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 8.45% for marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type, 8.05% for plasma cell <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp>, 7.45% for adult T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ATLL</z:e>), 6.7% for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 6.67% for peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of unspecified type, 2.79% for mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 2.6% for nasal and nasal-type T/NK cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 2.35% for angioimmunoblastic T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 2.35% for precursor B-cell lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, in decreasing order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other subtypes comprised less than 2%, mainly precursor T-cell lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (1.72%), anaplastic large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of T- and null-cell types (1.53%), and B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1.31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ATLL</z:e> was influenced by its high percentage (19.20%) in the south-western Japanese island, Kyushu, an endemic area of human T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> virus type 1 (HTLV-1), but which appeared to be lower than that in a previous study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The nodular <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> and mixed cellularity types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> occupied 1.78% and 1.63%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data are distinct from those in Western countries and similar in several ways to those in the East, although the relatively high rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ATLL</z:e> was attributed to the geographical difference in the etiologic factor, HTLV-1 </plain></SENT>
