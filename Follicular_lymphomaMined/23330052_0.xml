<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 69-year-old Japanese female was diagnosed with primary intestinal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with high-definition imaging revealed not only the typical feature of whitish <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> of up to 2 mm in diameter in the duodenal second and third portions, but also more detailed <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, such as enlarged whitish villi and tiny whitish depositions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These findings appeared to reflect the pathological structures; infiltration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells into the villi were probably seen as enlargement of the villi, and the formation of lymphoid follicles were shown as opaque <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">white spots</z:e> or tiny white depositions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, the above features might contribute to the distinct diagnosis of intestinal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case indicates that routine esophagogastroduodenoscopy can visualize microsurface structures, which can be pathognomonic and help to diagnose intestinal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, even without magnifying endoscopy </plain></SENT>
