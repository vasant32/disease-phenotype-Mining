<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: BM smears obtained by needle biopsy and stained by standard methods were analyzed in 60 patients with LGNHL using the Working Formulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BM infiltration was observed in 57% of the lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (A), in 48% of lymphoplasmocytic/ plasmocytoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (AI), and in 31% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (follicular small cleaved cell and follicular mixed B and C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The difference was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rates for patients with and without bone marrow infiltration were 53% and 56% respectively, and 10-year survival rates were 31% and 45% (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of bone marrow infiltration at diagnosis did not significantly affect the prognosis of LGNHL </plain></SENT>
