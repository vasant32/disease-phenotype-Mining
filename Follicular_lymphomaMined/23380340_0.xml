<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used the observational database of the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research to study the outcome of 533 patients with refractory diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) or grade III follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL-III) who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) using either myeloablative (MA; n = 307) or reduced-intensity/nonmyeloablative conditioning (RIC/NST; n = 226) between 1998 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse/progression, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only 45% of the patients at transplantation had a Karnofsky performance score of ≥90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up of surviving patients after MA and RIC/NST allo-HCT is 35 months and 30 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 3 years, MA allo-HCT was associated with a higher NRM compared with RIC/NST (53% versus 42%; P = .03), similar PFS (19% versus 23%; P = .40), and lower OS (19% versus 28%; P = .02), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, FL-III histology was associated with lower NRM (relative risk [RR], .52), reduced risk of relapse/progression (RR, .42), and superior PFS (RR, .51) and OS (RR, .53), whereas MA conditioning was associated with reduced risk of relapse/progression (RR, .66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite a refractory state, a small subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and FL-III patients can attain durable remissions after allo-HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conditioning regimen intensity was not associated with PFS and OS despite a higher risk of relapse/progression with RIC/NST allo-HCT </plain></SENT>
