<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e>) is characterized by a micronodular infiltrate of the splenic white pulp, centred on pre-existing follicles, with a peripheral rim of 'marginal' zone B-cells, always accompanied by a variable degree of red pulp infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These histological features can be closely mimicked by a variety of other small B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> when they involve the spleen, which makes recognition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e> difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore have compared the histopathological and immunohistochemical features of other non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) types with those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We selected cases of splenic involvement by different types of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, including mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytoma</z:e> (IM) and lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B-CLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A micronodular pattern and marginal zone differentiation were both found to be frequently present in FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, and with lesser frequency in IM and B-CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main morphological feature useful for differential diagnosis was the cytological composition of the white pulp tumoral nodules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e> is distinguished by characteristic dimorphic cytology, different from the monomorphic cytology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, and the distinctive mixture of centroblasts and centrocytes which is the rule in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>B-CLL could also be identified on the basis of the polymorphic cytology including small lymphocytes and prolymphocytes, whereas cases diagnosed as IM show prominent plasmacytic differentiation, lacking the features of the other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was particularly useful for the differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus the recognition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> was facilitated by the identification of cyclin D1 and CD43 reactivity, while FL could be recognized by the lack of IgD expression or the distinctive pattern of Ki67 staining found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>B-CLL cells were CD23+, CD43+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study provide morphological and immunohistological information useful in the recognition of the different varieties of NHLs when involving the spleen and the differential diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
