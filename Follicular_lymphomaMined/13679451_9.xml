<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent reports have indicated that the neoplastic T cells of angioimmunoblastic T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> express CD10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the demonstration of a CD10+ T-cell population may assist in establishing a diagnosis of angioimmunoblastic T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in distinguishing angioimmunoblastic T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from other peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been unclear, however, whether this phenotypically unusual T-cell population might be present in other settings as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report, we have retrospectively examined 64 cases of lymph node and solid tissue biopsies for the presence of CD10+ T cells using multicolor flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Discrete populations of CD10+ T cells were found in 5 of 28 cases (18%) of reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp>, 4 of 17 cases (23%) of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 9 of 19 cases (47%) of marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CD10+ T cells constituted 1-6% of total cells analyzed and &lt;/=14% of the total T-cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using two-color immunohistochemical stains, many of the CD10+ PAX5-negative presumptive T cells were found to be located within germinal centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> small subset of CD10+ peripheral T cells exists and, at least when present in small numbers, should not be considered an indication of a T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
