<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are few reports concerning cytogenetic findings of NHL, especially T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, in Asian people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the chromosomal abnormalities of 200 adult patients with NHL in Taiwan and correlated the non-random aberrations with the histological subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-eight patients (69%) had B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of the t(14;18) in total <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was lower in Taiwan (12%) than in the West (20-30%), but its incidence in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was comparable between the two areas (17 of 28 patients, 61% versus approximately 50-60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two patients (31%) had T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, including 11 angiocentric T/natural killer (NK)-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and only two angioimmunoblastic T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (AILD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The recurrent chromosomal abnormalities in T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> comprised 6q deletion (30%), 11q deletion (20%), 17p deletion (16%), -17 (16%), -Y (14%) and + 8 (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiocentric T/NK-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had a significantly higher frequency of 1q duplication (P=0.001), 6p duplication (P &lt;0.001) and 11q deletion (P=0.011) than other T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidences of +3 and +5, two common abnormalities in AILD, were quite low in T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Taiwan (4% and 2%, respectively), compared with those in the West (16-32% and approximately 15%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 11q deletion, not a common aberration in T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in western countries, occurred quite frequently in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The chromosomal aberrations of NHL are quite different among various geographical areas, which may reflect the differences in the distribution of the histological subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> among various areas </plain></SENT>
