<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the time of presentation, 30 (86%) had advanced stage disease and 25 (71%) received three or more chemotherapy regimens prior to transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 12 (34%) patients were in complete response pre-SCT following salvage therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the time of analysis (median follow-up 6 years from diagnosis and 4 years from transplantation), 24 patients were alive with an estimated 5-year OS and PFS of 66.5 and 53%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OS and PFS in patients receiving auto-SCT (91.7%, 73.3%) were superior compared with patients receiving allo-SCT (53.9%, 43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data support early use of auto-SCT in patients with FL and suggest the need to improve allo-SCT outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Integrating novel agents in a combined modality approach may improve long-term outcome in FL </plain></SENT>
