<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>According to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> classification, primary cutaneous follicle center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is not associated with the t(14;18)(q32;q21) and only rarely expresses bcl-2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further investigate this issue, we evaluated a series of 20 patients (14 men, 6 women) with primary cutaneous follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (PCFL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presenting skin lesion was located in the head and neck region in 16 of 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most cases were grade 2 (6/20) or grade 3 (13/20), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had a follicular architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated bcl-2 expression in 8 cases (40%), and expression was inversely related to the grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 7 grade 1 or 2 cases, 5 (71%) were positive, whereas only 3 (23%) of 13 grade 3 cases were positive for bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements were detected in 9 (45%) of 20 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 4 (20%) of 20 cases, we identified the major breakpoint of the t(14;18) by polymerase chain reaction, 3 of which were grade 1 or 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that bcl-2 protein expression and the t(14;18) are present in a subset of PCFL, particularly in lower grade cases </plain></SENT>
