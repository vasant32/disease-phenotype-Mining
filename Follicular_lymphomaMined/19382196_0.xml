<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the median fluorescent intensity (MFI) of CD38 as assessed by flow cytometry on B and T cell subpopulations in 102 lymph nodes specimens with histopathologically confirmed FL was compared with 55 cases of FH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The MFI of CD38 was highly significantly reduced in the neoplastic B cells in FL when compared with the reactive germinal center B cells in FH (P &lt; 1.0E-16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The MFI of CD38 did not differ between the non-neoplastic B-cells in FL and nongerminal center B-cells in FH (P = 0.14) or between T-cells and non-neoplastic B-cells in FL (P = 0.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A marginal increase in the MFI of CD38 was seen for T cells in FL compared with FH (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An increased difference in the MFI of CD38 was identified for T-cells compared with nongerminal center B-cells in FH (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No difference in CD38 expression was seen between Grades 1, 2, or 3 FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study also confirmed increased expression of CD10 (P &lt; 1.0E-9), decreased CD19 (P &lt; 1.0E-22), and CD20 (P &lt; 1.0E-16) in FL in comparison with FH, as has been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study identified decreased CD38 as a common finding in FL in comparison with FH and provides an additional tool to help differentiate FL from FH by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
