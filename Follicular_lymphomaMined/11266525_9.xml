<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the past, these have been termed composite <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, recent studies suggest that the two components are clonally related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is unknown whether the bcl-2 translocation present in most FCLs is present in the cells that demonstrate MZ cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have identified three cases of low-grade FCL with a MZ component suitable for laser capture microdissection (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>) of the two components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases were immunophenotyped in paraffin section with antibodies to CD10, CD20, bcl-2, and bcl-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e> was done to isolate cells from each component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction for t(14;18) using primers to the major breakpoint region was performed on DNA extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the PCR assay was decreased to 5%--10% follicle center cells in a background of reactive tonsil cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three cases showed different phenotypes in each component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The FCL component was positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four of the above markers, whereas the MZ component expressed only CD20 and bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both components showed t(14;18) amplicons of identical size, with the MZ component signal being stronger than the 5%--10% sensitivity control, suggesting that the signal was not from rare, contaminating FCL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that both components are clonally related and support the theory that these are indeed FCLs with MZ differentiation (that retain the t(14;18)) rather than the reverse, MZ <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with follicle center differentiation </plain></SENT>
