<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic polymorphism within regulatory regions of these cytokine genes can alter expression levels and may be important in development of lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigates a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and microsatellite variants present within these genes in a large cohort of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) cases including 211 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) and 281 cases of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), and 478 unaffected controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study investigated whether particular alleles at these loci, or their combination across the TNF region in the form of haplotypes, may act as markers for predisposition and development of NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study provided evidence for an influence of the TNF region in the susceptibility to NHL, whereby the loci -863, -857, TNFe and TNFd categorised five haplotype groups over which risk of both FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> varied significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prediction of disease risk was improved by the addition of loci to the haplotype, demonstrating the importance of considering the haplotype-specific context of the loci in genetic risk assessment </plain></SENT>
