<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical and pathologic features of 20 cases of DHL seen at our institution during a 5-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we carried out case-control comparisons of DHL with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and International Prognostic Index (IPI)-matched <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 11 men and 9 women had a median age of 63.5 years (range 32 to 91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients had a history of grade 1 to 2 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; review of the prior biopsy specimens in 2 of 5 cases revealed blastoid <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients had Ann Arbor stage 3 or 4 disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had elevated serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) levels at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extranodal disease was present in 17/20 (85%), bone marrow involvement in 10/17 (59%) and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) disease in 5/11 (45%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients (70%) died within 8 months of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival in the DHL group (4.5 mo) was inferior to both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> (P=0.002) and IPI-matched <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (P=0.04) control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twelve DHL cases (60%) were classified as B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, 7 cases (35%) as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, not otherwise specified, and 1 case as B-LBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Distinguishing features from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> included expression of Bcl2 (P&lt;0.0001), Mum1/IRF4 (P=0.006), Ki-67 &lt;95% (P&lt;0.0001), and absence of EBV-EBER (P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>DHL commonly contained the t(8;22) rather than the t(8;14) seen in most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> controls (P=0.001), and exhibited a higher number of chromosomal aberrations (P=0.0009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>DHL is a high-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> with a poor prognosis, resistance to multiagent chemotherapy, and clinical and pathologic features distinct from other high-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Familiarity with the morphologic and immunophenotypic spectrum of DHL is important in directing testing to detect concurrent IGH-BCL2 and MYC rearrangements when a karyotype is unavailable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The aggressive clinical behavior and combination of genetic abnormalities seen in these cases may warrant categorization as a separate entity in future classifications and call for novel therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
