<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CD43 expression on B cells is an immunophenotypic feature suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the light of its diagnostic importance, we performed a comprehensive survey of CD43 expression in various types of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and determined the frequency of its expression in routinely fixed paraffin-embedded tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tissue sections in 742 cases of NHL, pretreated by the heat-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> retrieval technique, were immunostained using an anti-CD43 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three categories of CD43 positivity were found: (1) more than 90% of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, B-cell small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases were positive; (2) 20% to 40% of nodal and extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>), diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt-like B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and lymphoplasmacytoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases were positive; and (3) 0% to 6% of primary splenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> and various types of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most CD43+ follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were predominantly large cell type with focally diffuse areas; their follicular center cell origin in 4 of 8 cases was supported by the presence of CD10 immunoreactivity and/or t(14;18) fusion gene product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD43 is frequently detectable in a subset of B-NHL, and, thus, it seems to be a highly sensitive marker for these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD43 also may be a useful marker for classifying B-cell NHLs by virtue of its differential expression in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
