<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The biological activity of the human BCL-2 gene product was analyzed in an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected human lymphoblastoid B-cell line transfected with BCL-2 sequences driven by the simian virus 40 promoter and enhancer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overproduction of the BCL-2 protein conferred a selective growth advantage to the EBV-infected B cells as selective growth advantage to the EBV-infected B cells as compared with control transfectants in low-serum medium and also after seeding at limiting dilution but did not render the cells tumorigenic in athymic <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This growth enhancement was also seen in cells transfected with the BCL-2 gene with its own promoter juxtaposed to the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene enhancer, which represents the translocated form of the BCL-2 gene observed in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with the t(14;18) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The growth advantage of EBV-infected B cells overproducing the BCL-2 protein is neither due to the enhanced growth factor production nor due to an enhanced sensitivity of the BCL-2 transfectants to interleukins 1 or 6, although both lymphokines are known to stimulate proliferation of EBV-infected B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The growth advantage of EBV-infected B cells by overproduction of the BCL-2 protein suggests the direct involvement of the BCL-2 gene product in the pathogenesis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
