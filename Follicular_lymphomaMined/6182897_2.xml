<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Variations in the distribution and structure of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> sequences between the different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and also <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> nodes, have been detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lectin-binding patterns of neoplastic lymphocytes of small cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, both follicular and diffuse, suggested a predominance of sialylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24396">glycopeptides</z:chebi>, as in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> small lymphocytes of the mantle zone of germinal centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the staining patterns of large cell follicular and diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed a greater diversity of carbohydrate structure, with enhanced cytoplasmic staining and increased numbers of incomplete <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharide</z:chebi> sequences </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extracellular matrix of small cell follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed altered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23008">saccharide</z:chebi> content, but retained some degree of organization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The large cell follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were characterized by a prominent disorderly matrix, with staining characteristics which suggested shedding of surface membrane from component cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The loss or disordered production of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> extracellular matrix may reflect a breakdown of control mechanisms within neoplastic follicles </plain></SENT>
