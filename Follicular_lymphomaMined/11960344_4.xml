<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study we describe alternative splicing of somatically mutated immunoglobulin (Ig) variable heavy chain (V(H)) genes in three distinct primary B cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (B-NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In two V4-34 expressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, ie a post-germinal center type B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (B-CLL) and a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), internally spliced V(H) gene transcripts were found in which a sequence stretch of 116 bp between the framework region 1 (FR1) and complementarity determining region 2 (CDR2) had been deleted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We provide evidence that for this alternative IgV(H) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> processing a known cryptic 5' splice donor site and a previously unidentified cryptic 3' splice acceptor site were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Site-directed mutagenesis showed that the cryptic 3' splice acceptor site had been activated by specific somatic point mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The B-CLL further harbored a triplication of the rearranged JH3 gene segment including the putative N region and part of the JH3-JH4 intron sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This triplication probably took place via a repeated mechanism of DNA double strand break followed by homologous recombination, a mechanism which was recently proposed also involved in the somatic hypermutation process and is compatible with the post-germinal center derivation of this B-CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, in a V4-34 expressing diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we observed alternative IgV(H) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> processing using the same cryptic 5' splice donor site and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> splice acceptor site of the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="29433">CH1</z:chebi>-C(mu) exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The significance of alternative IgV(H) processing in B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and as a potential mechanism of somatic Ig diversification is discussed </plain></SENT>
