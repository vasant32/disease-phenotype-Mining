<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This rearrangement has also been reported in very few <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells of the blood, tonsils, follicular <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> (FLH) of the lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> is often associated at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease with FLH, but the presence of rearranged bcl-2 B cells in these lymph nodes has not been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In using a standard PCR assay with Southern blot or a semi-nested PCR on 48 cases of FLH, we demonstrated that there were a few bcl-2 rearranged B cells in HIV FLH, at almost the same level as that in non-HIV-related FLH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The usual absence of bcl-2 rearrangement in the HIV-associated B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> suggests that the bcl-2 oncogene in the rearranged B cells of FLH is not cooperating with other oncogenes during HIV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
