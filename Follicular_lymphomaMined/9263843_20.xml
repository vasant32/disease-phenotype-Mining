<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are also common in dogs, which, as close companions of man, may constitute a useful experimental model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, comparisons cannot be made without a reliable morphological and immunological classification of canine NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Canine NHLs (n = 134) were classified on the basis of fine-needle lymph-node aspirates according to the Kiel classification, and 92 were re-classified according to the Working Formulation and the updated Kiel classification, in a histological and immunological study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotype was determined (1) in 92 cases by the use of the pan-T anti-CD3 polyclonal antibody and the pan-B anti-mb1 monoclonal antibody on paraffin wax-embedded tissue sections, and (2) in 47 cases by the use of a panel of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies on fresh preparations and frozen tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytological analysis showed a predominance of high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (73.9%) over low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (26.1%); it also demonstrated forms not reported in other species (small-cell variants, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with macronucleolated medium-sized cells [<z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMCs</z:chebi>], and polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> component) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histological examination revealed the rarity of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (2.2% of cases), an appearance suggestive of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (8.7% of cases), and evidence that some <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> originated in the marginal perifollicular zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some (26%) of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were of the T-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp>: the majority of these consisted of small-cell, low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mycosis fungoides</z:e>, the rest being either high-grade pleomorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (mixed or large-cell) or, rarely, high-grade, small noncleaved-cell, plasmacytoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> expressed a double (T and B) phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study revealed similarities with, but also notable differences from, human NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In particular, the <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> may constitute an interesting equivalent of human marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
