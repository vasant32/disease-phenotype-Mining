<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to the new classification proposed by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Study Group of Japan (LSG), there were 226 patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) which was further classified as diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (216 cases), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (4 cases), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mycosis fungoides</z:e> (4 cases), and others (2 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 216 cases of diffuse NHL were subdivided into small cell (2 cases), medium-sized cell (71 cases), mixed (7 cases), large cell (92 cases), pleomorphic (40 cases), lymphoblastic (3 cases), and Burkitt's type (1 case) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> appeared to have a poorer prognosis than B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
