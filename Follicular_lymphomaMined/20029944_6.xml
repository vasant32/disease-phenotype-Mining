<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up information of 496 female NHL incident cases diagnosed during 1996-2000 in Connecticut were abstracted from the Connecticut <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> Registry in 2008; survival analyses were conducted by comparing the Kaplan-Meier curves, and hazard ratios (HR) were computed from the Cox Proportional Hazard models adjusting for demographic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics which were suggested by previous studies to be determinants of NHL survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified six SNPs from four metabolism genes (CYP2E1, GSTP1, GSTT1, and NAT1) that were associated with NHL survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specifically, polymorphisms in GSTT1 were associated with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> survival; and polymorphisms in CYP2E1, GSTP1, and NAT1 were associated with survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that genetic polymorphisms in metabolic pathways may help improve the prediction of NHL survival and prognosis </plain></SENT>
