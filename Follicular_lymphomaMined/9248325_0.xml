<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment achieved complete remission (CR) in 83.3% of the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, with an overall 5-year survival rate of 63.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rate was 76.9% for the 60 patients who achieved CR, and this rate was significantly higher than that for patients who achieved only partial remission (PR) (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rate was 40% with the CHOP regimen and 74.3% with the COP-BLAM regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 3-year survival rate for biweekly COP-BLAM was 88.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 5-year disease free survival rate for patients who achieved CR was 80.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate reached a plateau after 42 months, and the same survival was maintained for more than 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that intensive chemotherapy is effective even against follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rate for patients who achieved PR, suggesting the importance of the response to initial chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
