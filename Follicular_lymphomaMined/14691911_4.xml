<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation may be evaluated by various methods, including Ki-67 immunohistochemistry and measures of telomerase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both methods would theoretically show comparable increases in a given case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the relationship between these 2 markers of proliferation in aggressive mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 48 cases were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study group included 5 cases of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>); 6 cases of Burkitt's/Burkitt's-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>); 9 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, grade 3 (FLC); and 28 cases of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Telomerase activity was measured as total product generated (TPG) units, and TPG results for the aforementioned cases were compared to the TPG results for 10 cases of reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An overlap in TPG scores between reactive cases and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in both log TPG (P = 0.0443) and Ki-67 (P = 0.0006) were seen in the different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation between Ki-67 percentage and TPG score was identified in FLC (r = 0.9281; P = 0.0003), but a poor correlation between these 2 indicators was seen in the other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cluster analysis identified distinct patterns for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, FLC, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> patterns for DLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because increases in both Ki-67 proliferation and telomerase activity are reported in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> germinal centers (GCs), these tests were also evaluated for usefulness as markers of a GC <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the FLC and DLC cases, features of a GC phenotype significantly correlated with increased Ki-67 percentage (P = 0.0152), but not with increased log TPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An elevated log TPG correlated with CD10 expression, and elevated Ki-67 percentage correlated with both CD10 and BCL-6 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>TPG level and Ki-67 percentage did not correlate with the presence of t(14;18) or BCL-2 protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although the proliferation patterns were fairly distinctive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, FLC, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, these studies show that markers of cell proliferation do not by themselves,identify distinct subtypes of large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>With the exception of FLC, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> exhibited poor correlation between telomerase activity and Ki-67 proliferation index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These tests did show some correlation with expression of GC cell phenotypic markers, however </plain></SENT>
