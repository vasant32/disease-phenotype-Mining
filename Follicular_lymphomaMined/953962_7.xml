<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities on bone scan compatible with lymphomatous involvement of the skeleton appeared to occur more commonly in patients with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> than in patients with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and were generally observed in the setting of advanced disease (15 of 23 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven (73%) of the 37 scans obtained were abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although abnormal scans were observed with the greatest frequency in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002653'>bone pain</z:hpo> (11 of 11), bone marrow involvement (11 of 12), abnormal skeletal radiographs (11 of 11), and <z:mp ids='MP_0002968'>elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels</z:mp> (5 of 6), bone scanning also detected lymphomatous involvement in patients free of pain or with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> laboratory tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, conventional radiography was entirely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in six (35%) of 17 patients with abnormal scans and revealed only nonspecific <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>osteopenia</z:hpo> in another two patients (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serial bone scans in nine patients reflected their response to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 37 scans, only one was judged falsely positive and one falsey negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bone scanning with 99mTc complexes is a safe, simple, and sensitive screening procedure for detecting both extensive and focal lymphomatous involvement of the skeletal system and is a useful means of following such involvement in response to treatment </plain></SENT>
