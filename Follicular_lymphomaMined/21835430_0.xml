<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report three cases of follicular dendritic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> (FDCS) showing a hitherto undescribed histological pattern consisting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1334971" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">nodular tumor</z:e> growth associated with small B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FDCS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells consistently showed large epithelioid features and were intermingled with small lymphocytes in the nodules in two cases, whereas they formed cohesive aggregates surrounded by lymphocyte mantle in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These features were easily confused with lymphomatous proliferations and, in particular, subtypes of Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, high-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and germinotropic large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was established by the use of a broad panel of antibodies that showed a variable expression of the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> markers CD21, CD23, CD35, clusterin, podoplanin, claudin 4, epidermal growth factor receptor, and CXCL13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The associated B lymphocytes revealed a mantle zone B phenotype, with expression of CD20 and PAX5, together with TCL1 and IgD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of notice, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, morphological features suggesting hyaline-vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017531" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GLNH|AFLH">Castleman disease</z:e> were recognized in the interfollicular areas, containing scattered epithelioid cells similar to those found in the nodules, thus providing a useful clue for FDCS diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 3 cases, 1 presented multiple recurrences unresponsive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and finally died of disease 14 years after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study further emphasizes the extreme variability of morphological presentation of FDCS and expands the spectrum of lesions showing a nodular growth pattern occurring in human lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
