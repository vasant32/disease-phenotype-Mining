<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>alpha-Calcidol which is metabolised to 1,25(OH)2D3 has been shown to produce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> regression in follicular low grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and the dose limiting toxicity is <z:hpo ids='HP_0003072'>hypercalcaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cellular action of 1,25(OH)2D3 is mediated by binding to an intracellular protein, the <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> receptor (VDR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have evaluated the activity of 1,25(OH)2D3 and its non-calcaemogenic analogue MC903 in the SU-DHL4 and SU-DUL5 B cell lines which carry the 14;18 translocation characteristic of follicular NHL, and also the expression of the VDR in a range of B cell NHLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both agents induced differentiation and had an antiproliferative effect on the SU-DHL4 and SU-DUL5 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However this occurred at a relatively high concentration (10(-7) M) which exceeds the physiological concentration of 1,25(OH)2D3 by approximately 10(3)-10(4)-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of the VDR was low in each cell line and in the low grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To account for the observed clinical response to 1 alpha OHD3 (alpha-calcidol) in follicular NHL a network is suggested whereby 1,25(OH)2D3 modulates the activity of CD4+T cells which have previously been shown to promote follicle centre cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28940">Vitamin D3</z:chebi> analogues may enable serum levels to be achieved which produce a direct action on follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells without disturbing calcium metabolism </plain></SENT>
