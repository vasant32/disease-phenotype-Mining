<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Postgrafting immunosuppression with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses were diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=13), transformed CLL (n=4), blastic mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=2) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade 3 (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median age was 51 (range, 29-69) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were high risk with relapsed/refractory disease or relapse after preceding autologous HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up of patients alive was 1115 (range, 1006-1252) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No directly RIT-related toxicities were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality was 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Incidences of grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD was 45% and 70%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier estimated 3-year OS and EFS were 20% for both dose levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, dose escalation of RIT and combined use with RIC is feasible with no additional toxicity due to dose escalation </plain></SENT>
