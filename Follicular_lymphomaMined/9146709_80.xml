<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine whether long-term exposure to pulse-modulated RF fields similar to those used in digital mobile telecommunications would increase the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in E mu-Pim1 transgenic mice, which are moderately predisposed to develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred female E mu-Pim1 mice were sham-exposed and 101 were exposed for two 30-min periods per day for up to 18 months to plane-wave fields of 900 MHz with a pulse repetition frequency of 217 Hz and a pulse width of 0.6 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incident power densities were 2.6-13 W/m2 and specific absorption rates were 0.008-4.2 W/kg, averaging 0.13-1.4 W/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> risk was found to be significantly higher in the exposed mice than in the controls (OR = 2.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>P = 0.006, 95% CI = 1.3-4.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were the major contributor to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002020'>increased tumor incidence</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus long-term intermittent exposure to RF fields can enhance the probability that mice carrying a lymphomagenic oncogene will develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that such genetically <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-prone mice provide an experimental system for more detailed assessment of dose-response relationships for risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> after RF-field exposure </plain></SENT>
