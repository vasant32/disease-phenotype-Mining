<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of fine needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> biopsy (FNAB) of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen aspirates of lymph nodes in which follow-up surgical biopsy revealed FL were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two aspirates were deemed unsatisfactory because of a paucity of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining 12 cases received the following diagnoses: 4 positive for malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 4 highly suspicious for malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 4 false negatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FNAB of FL can show a monomorphic or polymorphic cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aspirates with a positive or suspicious diagnosis showed monomorphic cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>False-negative diagnoses were attributable to misleading sampling or preparation methods in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that FNAB of FL is less accurate than FNAB of non-Hodgkin's malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) in general, but the accuracy rate is similar to that of FNAB of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> low-grade NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The value of current approaches to the diagnosis of suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> by FNAB is emphasized </plain></SENT>
