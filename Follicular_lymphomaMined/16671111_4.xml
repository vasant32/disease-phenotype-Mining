<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation is present in about 85% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) and can be identified using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the diagnostic laboratory setting, the cytologic archival material consists of stained slides, and only rarely is material saved for molecular testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors proposed FISH for FL using Papanicolaou-stained archival cytology material as a practical ancillary technique for diagnosing FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cases included 35 FL, 6 small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>/CLL), 4 mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>), 4 marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>), 1 lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (LPL), and 10 reactive lymphoid tissues (RLT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FISH was performed on Papanicolaou-stained archival cytology slides using probes for immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) on chromosome 14 and BCL2 on chromosome 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 25 of 32 (81%) FL cases exhibited the t(14;18) translocation, whereas 7 of 32 (19%) lacked the translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No cases of non-FL were positive for t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This series shows a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 100% for detecting the t(14;18) translocation as a diagnostic tool in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When performed on Papanicolaou-stained cytology slides, FISH for t(14;18) is relatively sensitive and quite specific for FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings are similar to those reported on other specimens, such as paraffin-embedded tissue and unstained cytology slides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The authors proposed that their technique would allow the pathologist and clinician the flexibility to utilize previously stained fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> slides for FISH evaluation </plain></SENT>
