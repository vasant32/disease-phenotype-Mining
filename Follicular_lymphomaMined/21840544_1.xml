<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 73-year-old man had episodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Symptoms largely resolved but <z:mp ids='MP_0000702'>adenopathy</z:mp> later lead to the diagnosis of a low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neurological symptoms soon recurred with new pontine calcifications identified by computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain biopsy revealed microvascular endothelial cell nuclear changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy identified small polymorphic bacteria without a cell wall and with terminal and attachment organelles within endothelial cells and clustered in some microvascular lumina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining was positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and convalescent serum enzyme immunoassay was positive for M. pneumoniae IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient again recovered and he was neurologically stable 33 months after the initial episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ultrastructural findings of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> cells are distinctive of some mycoplasmal species when compared to other small bacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mycoplasma-like organisms are reported in four autopsied patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorders</z:hpo>, and some of the same light- and electron-microscopic findings in the brain as our patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Direct neuroinvasion by Mycoplasma species has been suggested, while anatomic observations in our patient and in the four autopsy cases show microvascular invasion but not parenchymal invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most mycoplasmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> may be immune-mediated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The frequency of neurovascular invasion is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It may be rare and it may persist </plain></SENT>
