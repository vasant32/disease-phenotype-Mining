<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only microvessels displaying a cross-sectional area corresponding to a diameter of between 3.2 and 34.6 microm were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intratumoral microvascular density (iMVD) was found to be significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_339'>lymphatic leukaemia</z:mpath> (CLL, n = 13) compared with the clinically more aggressive mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, n = 9) and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, n = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>iMVD in CLL was also higher than in the follicular neoplastic parts (FL FOLL) of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL, n = 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In FL FOLL the microvessel density was, moreover, significantly lower than in the surrounding non-neoplastic FL tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002840'>lymphadenitis</z:hpo> (LA, n = 10) the iMVD was higher than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, FL FOLL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that future studies focusing on the relationship between iMVD and the clinical outcome within each particular NHL group should be carried out in order to verify whether iMVD is a prognostic factor in NHL, as it is in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
