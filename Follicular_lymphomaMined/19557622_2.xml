<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of mutations or polymorphisms in genes related to immune system might involve an additional disadvantage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to analyze <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi>-binding lectin (MBL-2 gene) mutations and their association with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and event-free survival in patients diagnosed with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, treated uniformly, in the clinical trial LNHF-03 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of this trial showed impressive clinical efficacy but was complicated with 80 documented infectious episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified into two genotypic groups, AA and AO/OO, based on their haplotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither the number of infectious episodes nor differences in event-free survival was found as a function of MBL-2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other factors, including the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and the immune alterations associated with the disease, should be considered responsible for this observation </plain></SENT>
