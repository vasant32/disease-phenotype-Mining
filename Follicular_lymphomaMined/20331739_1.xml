<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The strategy to apply involved-field radiotherapy (IF-RT) after immunochemotherapy in patients with bulky follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: To evaluate the benefit of consolidating IF-RT, we retrospectively analysed relapse patterns and survival of patients with bulky FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated within a multicenter prospective randomized trial on 126 patients with one, three or six cycles Rituximab and six cycles CHOP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to the protocol, patients presenting with bulky disease were to undergo consolidating IF-RT after immunochemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-two eligible patients with bulky disease were identified, of which 26 were irradiated and 16 were not, contrary to the demand of the protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the irradiated and the non-irradiated group regarding presenting characteristics (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 60 months, 21 patients relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the irradiated group, relapse occurred in 12 of 26 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of relapses were located within the original bulk or within the bulk plus a new location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the non-irradiated group, 9 of 16 patients relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference between exposure to IF-RT and the likelihood of a relapse per se (P = 0.751) or at a specific location (P = 0.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six-yr-PFS- (P = 1.0) and OS-rates (P = 0.68) were 52% and 80% after IF-RT and 48% and 73% without IF-RT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was no difference in relapse rate, PFS and OS between patients treated with and without consolidating IF-RT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This is the first analysis of its kind conducted in the Rituximab era </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, these results are based on a relatively small cohort size and are derived from a retrospective analysis, with the limitations of such an analysis being well known </plain></SENT>
