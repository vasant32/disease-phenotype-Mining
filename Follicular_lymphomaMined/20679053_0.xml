<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five cases in an oncologic referral center from 1995 to 2008, were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each case had detailed immunophenotypic analysis using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (CD45, CD20, CD3, CD5, CD23, BCL2, BCL6, BCL10, Ki67, CD30, CD15, BCL1, Kappa, Lambda, CD138) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lesions were classified by using WHO (2008) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients were found to have primary and two secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological subtypes were: 16 patients with marginal zone B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, four diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, two mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, two follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and one Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 25 patients studied, 22 had localized stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was the most frequent type of primary orbital and adnexal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this study <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e> was observed in most cases, and distant spread of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was infrequent </plain></SENT>
