<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report 7 cases of primary tonsillar <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> with focal follicular features that presented with morphologic, immunohistochemical, and biological features distinct from those of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histologically, these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were characterized by involvement of pericryptal follicles with adjacent dominant diffuse areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Monomorphous large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were evenly spaced with abundant, often clear cytoplasm, and blastoid nuclei often with a delicate nuclear membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, residual germinal centers (GCs) were present in the form of either an intrafollicular GC remnant or an isolated GC in the midst of diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An extrafollicular and/or parafollicular growth pattern was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bcl-6 staining revealed a predominantly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> occurrence of Bcl-6(+) cells, comprising &lt;50% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, and none displayed diffusely dense collections (&gt;75%) of Bcl-6(+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells characteristic of the GC or FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Staining for CD10 was negative in 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five of 7 patients were younger than 60, the median age of other patients with primary tonsillar <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No extratonsillar involvement was seen at 18 months after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After chemotherapy or radiotherapy, complete remission was achieved with ease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, but 2 patients who were treated with chemotherapy alone relapsed at 24 and 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, tonsillar <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> includes a small (10%) but distinct subgroup that warrants distinction from FL with predominant diffuse areas or de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It appears that the focal follicular features in tonsillar <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> likely represent follicular colonization of marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, probably high-grade, if the possibility of FL is excluded </plain></SENT>
