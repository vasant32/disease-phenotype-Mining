<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RQ-PCR by the use of TaqMan detection system is a sensitive tool to monitor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) in FL through amplification of the t(14;18) fusion gene during and post-therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In most cases the breakpoint region occurs within the major breakpoint region (MBR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 75 patients diagnosed with FL, cells harboring the fusion gene BCL2/JH were found in peripheral blood of 31 patients (41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further monitored 30 of these patients in a period varying from 6 months to 5 years by RQ-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In our study the level indicating the possibility of the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> was established at more than five t(14;18)-positive cells in the background of 83,000 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of this work also confirmed that the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> detected by RQ-PCR is an indication for careful observation of patients because of a higher risk of disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
