<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Progression of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to a more aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is seen in the majority of patients, and approximately 10% of the transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> have a translocation of c-myc in addition to the translocation of bcl-2 found in the original follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether transcriptional deregulation of bcl-2 and c-myc could be examined in primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells by in vivo footprinting and in vitro protein-DNA binding studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A matched pair of follicular and transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had acquired a translocation of c-myc into the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High levels of bcl-2 expression were observed in both the follicular and transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, whereas the expression of c-myc was low in the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and increased in the transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo footprint analysis revealed that a CRE site and a Cdx site in the bcl-2 promoter were occupied on the translocated alleles but not on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alleles in both the follicular and transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two nuclear factor kappaB sites were occupied on the translocated c-myc allele in the transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gel shift analysis revealed that these proteins bound to their respective sites in the bcl-2 or c-myc promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence that the presence of one of the translocations in the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus influenced the expression of the other translocated gene </plain></SENT>
