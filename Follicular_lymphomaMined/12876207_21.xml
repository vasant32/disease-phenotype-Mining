<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was therefore to develop a robust FISH method for the demonstration of translocations in archival tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The technique was evaluated by comparison with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), capable of detecting the majority of known breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight paired frozen and fixed cases of FL and 20 reactive controls were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18) was detected in 23 of 28 cases using PCR on frozen material and 8 of 20 in paraffin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using FISH, 24 of 26 frozen and 26 of 28 paraffin cases had a demonstrable translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 20 reactive nodes were negative for the t(14;18) by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using FISH, one of the reactive cases had occasional cells with a translocation FISH pattern, demonstrable in frozen and paraffin samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the presence of the t(14;18), which is well described in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both PCR and FISH are highly effective for t(14;18) analysis in unfixed tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When only paraffin blocks are available, FISH is the method of choice, and a result was achieved in 100% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The method is applicable to the retrospective analysis of a range of translocations </plain></SENT>
