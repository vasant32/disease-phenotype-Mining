<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we used a human follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, HF1A3, to study molecular mechanisms of CD95-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and CD40-induced rescue from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD95 stimulation induced activation of caspase-8 and -3, collapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential (DeltaPsim), release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> and fragmentation of nuclear DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these apoptotic events were abrogated, when cells were pretreated with CD40 antibodies before CD95 stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD40 induced a rapid up regulation of both short and long isoforms of c-FLIP, as these proteins were detectable 4h after receptor stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The induction of c-FLIP as well as the anti-apoptotic function of CD40 was completely abolished when NF-kappaB activity was inhibited by a selective inhibitor PDTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the anti-apoptotic signaling of CD40 involves NF-kappaB-mediated induction of c-FLIP proteins which can interfere with caspase-8 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, it remains to be seen whether c-FLIP proteins are the only one ones involved in CD40-mediated protection </plain></SENT>
