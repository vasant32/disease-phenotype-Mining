<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present 2 CL cases composed of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), each with unique clinicopathologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first case, the FL was negative for IGH-BCL2 and harbored a novel IGH-associated translocation; in the second case, the CL manifested in the skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The individual components in both CLs were derived from different B-cell clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is the first complete characterization, including molecular analysis, of CLs composed of leukemic CLL and FL and the first report of a cutaneous CL derived from 2 low-grade B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results provide additional supporting evidence that CLs of indolent B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are biclonal and suggest that they are pathogenetically different from CLs composed of a low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and an aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which are usually clonally related </plain></SENT>
