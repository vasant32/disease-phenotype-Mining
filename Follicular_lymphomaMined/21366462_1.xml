<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>eIF-4F activity is controlled by a repressor binding protein (4E-BP1), which promotes translation when phosphorylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the level of expression and phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in various subtypes of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and reactive lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples and reactive lymphoid tissues were immunostained and examined for expression of 4E-BP1 and phosphorylated 4E-BP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of components of the eIF-4F complex and unphosphorylated and phosphorylated 4E-BP1 was confirmed using Western immunoblotting on lysates of frozen <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples and reactive tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated weak to undetectable 4E-BP1 staining within benign, reactive germinal centers (N = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 4E-BP1 was consistently expressed (moderate to strong staining) in 98% of various subtypes of mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (N = 50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>4E-BP1 expression was also demonstrable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 lymph nodes with in situ or partial involvement by follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 cases of BCL2-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The level of phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, evaluated by immunohistochemistry, was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The immunohistochemical expression pattern of 4E-BP1 exhibits regional and cellular specificity in reactive lymphoid tissues and may offer a diagnostic tool for distinguishing reactive follicles from neoplastic B-cell proliferations </plain></SENT>
