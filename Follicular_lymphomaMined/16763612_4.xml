<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further understand these defects, we profiled the apoptotic gene expression of these two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oligonucleotide arrays with 112 apoptotic genes were used, and data analysis was performed on seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and 10 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> frozen <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples from six and seven patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall gene expression pattern was strikingly similar among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 17 samples, regardless of the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and history of chemotherapy exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MCL1, TNFRSF1B and TNFRSF7 were highly expressed in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The apoptotic gene expression between the groups of untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (n=3) and untreated follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=6) was also similar (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison between the groups of untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (n=3) and postchemotherapy <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (n=4) revealed six genes with &gt;2-fold changes, including BIRC5/Survivin that was higher in the postchemotherapy samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding was validated by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar analysis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases did not identify any significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To conclude, our findings suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> share common apoptotic defects, and highlight the importance of MCL1 and the TNF pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Upregulation of survivin may be one of the mechanisms by which <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> becomes desensitized to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
