<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three cases were classified as IDL according to histologic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotypic analysis was performed in 27 cases, and clinical records were available for 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age was 58 years, and the male-to-female ratio, 3.4:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented with stage III or IV disease, and five had extranodal presentations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 56.3 months, with only three patients having a prolonged relapse-free survival (greater than 2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Morphologically, 14 cases were diffuse or only vaguely nodular; 18 cases showed a mantle zone pattern with naked germinal centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward prolonged median survival for patients with the mantle zone (77.4 months, p = 0.098) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The neoplastic population was composed of irregular or cleaved small lymphoid cells with a mitotic rate ranging from 5 to 62 per 20 high-power fields (hpf) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A histologically distinctive variant with blastic cytologic features was identified (seven cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The blastic variant was associated with a higher mitotic index (51.3 versus 19.0) and shortened survival (24.9 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the histologic progression often observed in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, in no case was transformation to a large-cell or small noncleaved <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases had a mature B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> demonstrating monoclonal Ig and B-cell surface antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Seventy-eight percent were CD5 positive; three of six CD5-negative cases presented in mucosal-associated extranodal sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CD10 and CD25 were expressed in 52% and 44%, respectively, but did not show clinical correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The proliferative rate measured by Ki-67 positivity correlated with the mitotic index, but neither of these parameters had a statistically significant influence on survival </plain></SENT>
