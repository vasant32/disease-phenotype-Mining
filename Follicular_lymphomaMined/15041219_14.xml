<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the incidence of t(14;18)(q32;q21) in 54 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) by dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization on paraffin-embedded tissue sections (tissue-FISH) using probes for BCL2 and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18) was detected in 28 (56%) of 50 patients, who were successfully analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, BCL2 protein expression was detected in 45 (83%) of 54 patients evaluated by immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a discrepancy between t(14;18) and BCL2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The absence of t(14;18) was associated with disease-free survival (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference, however, in overall survival and failure-free survival between the t(14;18)-positive and -negative groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tissue-FISH should be of great value to detect t(14;18) in FL because this method enabled us to demonstrate specifically t(14;18)-positive individual cells in neoplastic follicles on paraffin-embedded tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, tissue-FISH can be applied to small specimens obtained from endoscopic biopsy or specimens obtained more than 10 years ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We validated the usefulness of tissue-FISH as a diagnostic procedure and retrospective meta-analysis for malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
