<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In a first prospective nonrandomized trial, 107 patients with Stage III and IV "low-grade" <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> have been treated with a combination of chemotherapy and low-dose total body irradiation (LD-TBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study shows that this scheme of LD-TBI was very well tolerated, gave a high response rate (83%), and extended <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It incited us to start a pilot study on localized follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: From January 1986 through October 1994, 34 patients with previously untreated localized low-grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> have been included in a prospective trial with LD-TBI followed by radical involved field radiotherapy (IF-RT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients received two courses of whole body irradiation of 0.75 Gy in 5 fractions and 1 week separated by a rest period of 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 1 month, patients were reevaluated, and received 40 Gy in 20 fractions, and 4 weeks on initially pathological lymph node areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients have been excluded from the study: 4 after histologic review (2 centrocytic, 1 lymphocytic, 1 centroblastic) and 4 patients with Stage IV because of bone-marrow involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining 26 patients were 11 men and 15 women, 50 years old median age (mean: 50.2; range: 35-73.5) with clinical Stage I (10 pts), II1 (8 pts), and II2 (8 pts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received the planned treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical tolerance was excellent, and the hematological follow-up shows a mean nadir value of 3.9.10(9)/l (2.1-8.1) for leucocytes, 13.4 g/l (10.8-15.4) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, and 124.10(9)/l (46-216) for platelets, with a median delay of 3.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 26 patients, 24 achieved complete remission (CR) after the LD-TBI that was before the IF-RT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients, except one, were in complete remission after IF-RT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients remain alive without any evidence of disease, with a median follow-up of 56.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Five patients relapsed; 3 of them died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: As delivered, this schedule of LD-TBI give a very high rate of CR in localized follicular non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, with a very good tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It remains to prove that this immediate efficacy has an impact on long-term disease-free survival in such patients, and to understand how the LD-TBI works (direct and/or indirect induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>; relationship with t(14;18) translocation and overexpression of bcl-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These will be the two aims of a new EORTC prospective randomized trial comparing LD-TBI followed by IF-RT vs. IF-RT alone </plain></SENT>
