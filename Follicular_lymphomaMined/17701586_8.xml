<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there is relatively little data on PET in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade 1 (FL-1) and grade 2 (FL-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this manuscript, we present our findings utilizing PET in treated FL-1 and FL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A retrospective review of patients who underwent PET examinations at our institution produced 95 PET examinations among 31 patients with FL-1 and FL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PET was obtained at initial staging, mid-induction and post-treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results were compared with clinical follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PET had high sensitivity (95%) and specificity (88%) for lesion detection in treated FL-1 and FL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Abnormal foci in FL-1 and FL-2 had similar intensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Post-induction PET positive patients had shorter mean progression free survivals compared with PET negative patients (p-value &lt; or =0.001), post-salvage PET positive trended toward shorter mean response duration compared with negative patients (p-value: 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that PET is accurate in the diagnostic assessment of treated FL-1 and FL-2 and, post-treatment PET positive patients are likely to relapse prior to PET negative patients </plain></SENT>
