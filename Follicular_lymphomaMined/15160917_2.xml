<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the main objective was to elucidate the role of UAE as predictor of response to treatment and time to progression in low-grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We included 52 patients with newly diagnosed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre- and post-treatment median UAE level was 17.5 and 12.0 microg/min, respectively (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly more patients with a pre-treatment UAE below the median level were in CR after treatment (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with a clinical response to treatment had a significantly lower frequency of UAE above the median post-treatment level (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>UAE at the time of progression increased to a significantly higher level compared with the post-treatment level (26.5 vs. 16.0 microg/min; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median response duration and progression-free survival were significantly longer in patients with a post-treatment UAE below the median level (P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we found elevated UAE to be a highly sensitive indicator of clinical behavior in newly diagnosed low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both response to treatment and time to progression were predicted by levels of UAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to confirm the clinical implications of UAE in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
