<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2 gene is a unique proto-oncogene that blocks <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>; its product is localized on the inner <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In non neoplastic human lymphoid tissues, bcl-2 protein is strongly expressed in the small recirculating lymphocytes of the follicular mantle zone; it is expressed less intensely in T-cell areas, and is almost absent from germinal center cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 mRNA, in contrast to bcl-2 protein, is strongly expressed on most of the latter cells, a similar phenomenon also being observed in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Resting PBL express both bcl-2 mRNA and protein, while most lymphoblasts in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-stimulated PBL cultures lose bcl-2 protein and become apoptotic, despite expressing higher levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Posttranscriptional regulation of the bcl-2 gene may cause this paradoxical down-regulation of bcl-2 protein and may play an important role in the clonal selection of lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 protein is frequently expressed in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> bearing the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation, but it is also widely expressed in many other B- and T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> without bcl-2 rearrangement, showing that mechanisms other than t(14;18) translocation may deregulate bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Many lymphoid and myeloid cell lines also express bcl-2 protein with no correlation being shown with differentiation stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is conceivable that bcl-2 protein may play a role in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> of many hematolymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> by interfering with programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, in concert with other oncogenes or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes </plain></SENT>
