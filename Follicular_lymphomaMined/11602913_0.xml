<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By analysing the results of our own transplant program in patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> we tried to evaluate indications for allogeneic transplantations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients treated at the Klinikum Grosshadern between 1985 and 2001 were analysed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 56 patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>24 patients had low grade Non-Hogdkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) (follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>: n = 8, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>: n = 6) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL: n = 10), 16 patients had high grade NHL (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e>/lymphoblastic: n = 5; large cell/diffuse: n = 5) and 8 patients suffered from Hodgkins's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median age was 41 years, 34 patients were transplanted from an HLA-identical sibling, 19 from an HLA-id. unrelated donor and three from an HLA-mismatched related donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>30 patients received bone marrow and 26 peripheral blood stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>22 pat. were treated with an intensive 12 Gy TBI containing conditioning regimen, whereas 34 patients were treated with a dose-intensity reduced conditioning procedere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>25 patients are alive between 2 month and 15 years after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall survival after 2 years is 48 % for patients with low grade NHL (incl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CLL), 9.3 % for patients with high grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 25 % for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>1-year-transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 33.9 % in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Dose-intensity-reduced conditioning was not able to reduce TRM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Allogeneic bone marrow or stem cell transplantation is able to induce long lasting complete remissions in patients with heavily pretreated malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Results of allogeneic transplantation are encouraging in patients with follicular and other low grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However transplant-related toxicity is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>At present the impact of reducing the intensity of conditioning is not yet clear </plain></SENT>
