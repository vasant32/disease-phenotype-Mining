<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Cetuximab, a chimeric immunoglobulin G 1 (IgG1) anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody (mAb), has shown efficacy in 10% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies demonstrate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) is one of the modes of action for rituximab and trastuzumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fragment c (Fc) portion of IgG1 mAb has shown to induce ADCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fragment c gamma receptors (FcgammaR) play an important role in initiating ADCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies have shown that two IgG FcgammaR polymorphisms (FCGR2A-H131R and FCGR3A-V158F) independently predict response to rituximab in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis of whether these two polymorphisms are associated with clinical outcome in metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients treated with single-agent cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients were enrolled onto the ImClone0144 trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based method, gene polymorphisms of FCGA2A-H131R and FCGA3A-V158F were assessed from genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FCGR2A-H131R and FCGR3A-V158F polymorphisms were independently associated with progression-free survival (PFS; P = .037 and .055, respectively; log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combined analysis of these two polymorphisms showed that patients with the favorable genotypes (FCGR2A, any histidine allele, and FCGR3A, any phenylalanine allele) showed a median PFS of 3.7 months (95% CI, 2.4 to 4.4 months), whereas patients with any two unfavorable genotypes (FCGR2A arginine/arginine or valine/valine) had a PFS of 1.1 months (95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4 months; P = .004; log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our preliminary data suggest that these two polymorphisms may be useful molecular markers to predict clinical outcome in metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients treated with cetuximab and that they may indicate a role of ADCC of cetuximab </plain></SENT>
