<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Revised response rates based on International Workshop Response Criteria are also provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Enrollment began in April 1994 and consisted of patients with histologically confirmed, low-grade, B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who had received no prior chemotherapy or who had no more than four prior standard therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received six cycles of CHOP and six infusions of rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight (21%) of the 38 treated patients were classified as International Working Formulation (IWF) A, 16 (42%) were IWF B, 13 (34%) were IWF C, and one (3%) was IWF D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine (24%) of 38 patients had received prior chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine (24%) of 38 were considered poor risk according to the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall response rate was 100%; 87% of patients achieved a complete response or unconfirmed complete response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> and DR were 82.3 months and 83.5 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven of eight patients who were bcl-2 positive at baseline converted to negative, and three of the seven patients have sustained the molecular remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although a cure has not been found yet for follicular NHL, the R-CHOP combination provides a lengthy response duration in patients with relapsed or newly diagnosed indolent NHL </plain></SENT>
