<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Caenorhabditis elegans gene ced-9 and the human proto-oncogene bcl-2, both of which protect cells from programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, are members of the same gene family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ced-9 and bcl-2 were discovered because of the effects of dominant gain-of-function mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such bcl-2 mutations, which are commonly found in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, are translocations that result in over-expression of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Bcl-2 protein in B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we report that, by contrast, the ced-9(n1950) gain-of-function mutation affects the open reading frame of ced-9 and results in a glycine-to-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> substitution in a region highly conserved among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ced-9/bcl-2 family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that this glycine has an important function in ced-9 regulation, and we suggest that alteration of this glycine in other members of the ced-9/bcl-2 family might lead to oncogenic activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also present genetic evidence suggesting that the <z:chebi fb="50" ids="3547">CED</z:chebi>-9 protein might exist in two distinct forms that have opposite effects on cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
