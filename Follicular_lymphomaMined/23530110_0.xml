<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Although rituximab (R) is commonly used for patients with advanced follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) requiring treatment, the optimal associated chemotherapy regimen has yet to be clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted an open-label, multicenter, randomized trial among adult patients with previously untreated stages II to IV FL to compare efficacy of eight doses of R associated with eight cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CVP) or six cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHOP) or six cycles of fludarabine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> (FM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The principal end point of the study was time to treatment failure (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 534 patients enrolled onto the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall response rates were 88%, 93%, and 91% for R-CVP, R-CHOP, and R-FM, respectively (P=.247) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 34 months, 3-year <z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTFs</z:chebi> were 46%, 62%, and 59% for the respective treatment groups (R-CHOP v R-CVP, P=.003; R-FM v R-CVP, P=.006; R-FM v R-CHOP, P=.763) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 52%, 68%, and 63% (overall P=.011), respectively, and 3-year overall survival was 95% for the whole series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>R-FM resulted in higher rates of grade 3 to 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (64%) compared with R-CVP (28%) and R-CHOP (50%; P&lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 23 second <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> were registered during follow-up: four in R-CVP, five in R-CHOP, and 14 in R-FM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study, R-CHOP and R-FM were superior to R-CVP in terms of 3-year <z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi> and PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, R-CHOP had a better risk-benefit ratio compared with R-FM </plain></SENT>
