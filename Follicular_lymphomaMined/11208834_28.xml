<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the incidence and frequency of the Bcl-2/IgH rearrangement in the peripheral blood of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals to define the potential complication this may pose for the molecular monitoring of disease in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The incidence and frequency of the major breakpoint cluster region rearrangement in DNA extracted from peripheral blood or lymphoblastoid cell lines from 481 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals was determined using a TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction assay (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty three percent of samples were positive for the Bcl-2/IgH rearrangement, with approximately 3% of these at levels of more than 1 in 10(4) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of circulating Bcl-2/IgH+ cells, other than those derived from the malignant clone, could confound the detection and quantitation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> in patients with FL, particularly at low levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden </plain></SENT>
