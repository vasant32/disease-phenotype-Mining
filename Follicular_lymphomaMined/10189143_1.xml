<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is the first report describing the outcome of these patients based on a population-based cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with advanced stage LGFL between 1987-1995 for the adult population of central and northern Alberta, Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-seven patients were diagnosed with advanced stage LGFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Approximately 45% of patients had died at last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment was initiated at the time of diagnosis in 87 patients (55%), with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> used in 66% of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 70 patients not treated at the initial diagnosis, 69% had been treated at a median of 16.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall median survival was 5.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, significant variables (P &lt; 0.20) included age, B symptoms, symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group performance status, baseline <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH), diffuse component on histology, and treatment at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, the only factors that influenced survival significantly and independently were baseline LDH and B symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An elevated baseline LDH had a hazard ratio of 2.80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65, 4.74) and a median survival of 8.0 years versus 3.6 years (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>B symptoms had a hazard ratio of 2.30 (95% CI, 1.23, 4.30) and a median survival of 6.5 years versus 3.1 years (P &lt; 0.0067) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although some patients with advanced stage LGFL enjoy a prolonged survival, 80% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in this cohort were attributable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival of 5.9 years offers a less positive perspective on the outcome of these patients than in previous nonpopulation-based reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This emphasizes the need for further population-based studies as well as new therapeutic approaches, especially those directed toward patients with poor prognostic features such as elevated baseline LDH and B symptoms </plain></SENT>
