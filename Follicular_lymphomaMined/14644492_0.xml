<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To study <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32213">thallium-201-chloride</z:chebi> scintigraphy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37804">201Tl</z:chebi>-S) in staging and monitoring response after radiotherapy in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-one consecutive and unselected FL patients were examined by 'Conventional Standard Staging' (CSS) procedures (history and physical examination, ultrasound, CT scans, biopsies and fine needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> cytology) prior to irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight standardized potentially affected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> localizations (neck, axilla, mediastinum, spleen, paraaortic, parailiac, femoral and extranodal) per patient were separately studied, resulting in the investigation of 328 localizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes after the intravenous administration of a tracer dose of 150 MBq <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32213">thallium-201-chloride</z:chebi> total body images were made, immediately followed by single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography acquisition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> localizations were subsequently irradiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were re-examined after a median of 4 weeks (range 3-6 weeks) by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CSS modalities and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37804">201Tl</z:chebi>-S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic performance was evaluated both per site and per patient, both in the diagnostic phase of the study as well as in the post-treatment re-evaluation phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In staging, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37804">201Tl</z:chebi>-S was positive in 82 of the 129 initial positive regions by CSS (64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This percentage increased to 70% when eliminating upper abdominal lymph nodes from the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 24 patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lesions were visualized by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37804">201Tl</z:chebi>-S, in 11 patients some but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lesions were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In six patients none of the lesions were detected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37804">201Tl</z:chebi>-S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In four patients, four additional lesions were initially found by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37804">201Tl</z:chebi>-S only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After irradiation, 83 of the total 86 positive regions reached a complete or partial remission by CSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Eighty-one of these were also diagnosed as remission by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37804">201Tl</z:chebi>-S and two as stable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In 31 out of 35 patients (89%; 95% CI: 73-97%) the overall response in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> irradiated sites was identical by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37804">201Tl</z:chebi>-S and CSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Only two patients, in remission on CSS modalities, showed stable disease on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37804">201Tl</z:chebi>-S, while two others were diagnosed as CR by CSS and PR by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37804">201Tl</z:chebi>-S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37804">201Tl</z:chebi>-S has limited additional value in staging FL patients, since only two-thirds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> localizations are detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37804">201Tl</z:chebi>-S is accurate in monitoring radiation treatment response in FL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>If an FL patient with a positive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37804">201Tl</z:chebi>-S at diagnosis is treated by irradiation, the treatment response can be reliably ascertained by only performing a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37804">201Tl</z:chebi>-S </plain></SENT>
