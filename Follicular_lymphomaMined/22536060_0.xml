<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is considered incurable with conventional treatments, and current therapeutic options are associated with significant toxicities that are especially limiting in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">Bortezomib</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">PS-341</z:chebi>; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">Velcade</z:chebi>(Â®)), a first-in-class drug targeting the proteolytic core subunit of the 26S proteasome, has emerged as a therapeutic alternative in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, with promising preclinical data and efficacy in patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several clinical trials were conducted with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a single agent, overall responses in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> varied greatly (16%-41%), with weekly <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> showing less neurotoxicity than twice-weekly regimens, but with concern about decreased responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combination with rituximab was projected to improve the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi>, but this resulted in increased toxicities and questionable added benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the largest Phase III study in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> plus rituximab versus rituximab alone demonstrated a significant progression-free survival difference, the absolute difference was small (12.8 months versus 11 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combining <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> with established regimens, such as rituximab plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (R-CHOP), rituximab, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (R-CVP), or rituximab-bendamustine also did not show definite benefit, and many of these studies did not meet their primary endpoint when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> failed to improve responses or survival to the degree anticipated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a disease where the goal of treatment is palliative and affected patients often have other medical and treatment-related comorbidities, decisions regarding therapies which carry risks of additional toxicities must be considered carefully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusive evidence of the ability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> to improve patient outcomes meaningfully and to justify the added toxicity is lacking, but limitations in cross-trial comparisons are recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Large randomized trials and investigations of combinations with promising novel targeted agents will aid in determining the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi>, if any, in the future treatment of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
