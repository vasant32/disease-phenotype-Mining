<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous research suggests associations of lower alcohol intake and higher tobacco consumption with increased risks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prospective Million Women Study provides sufficient power for reliable estimates of subtype-specific associations in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Approximately 1.3 million middle-aged women were recruited in the United Kingdom during 1996-2001 and followed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, emigration and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registration until 2009 (mean 10.3 years per woman); potential risk factors were assessed by questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adjusted relative risks were estimated by Cox regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During follow-up, 9162 incident cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancy</z:e> were recorded, including 7047 lymphoid and 2072 myeloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among predominantly moderate alcohol drinkers, higher intake was associated with lower risk of lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, in particular diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (relative risk 0.85 per 10â€‰g alcohol per day (95% confidence interval 0.75-0.96)), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (0.86 (0.76-0.98)) and plasma cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (0.86 (0.77-0.96)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among never- and current smokers, higher cigarette consumption was associated with increased risk of Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1.45 per 10 cigarettes per day (1.22-1.72)), mature T-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (1.38 (1.10-1.73)) and myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disease (1.42 (1.31-1.55)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings confirm and extend existing evidence for associations of subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancy</z:e> with two common exposures in women </plain></SENT>
