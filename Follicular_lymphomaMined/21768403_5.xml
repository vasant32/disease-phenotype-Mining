<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, previous studies did not account for passive smoking exposure in the never-smoking reference group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The California Teachers Study collected information about lifetime smoking and household passive smoking exposure in 1995 and about lifetime exposure to passive smoking in 3 settings (household, workplace, and social settings) in 1997-1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariable-adjusted relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were estimated by fitting Cox proportional hazards models with follow-up through 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with never smokers, ever smokers had a 1.11-fold (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.94, 1.30) higher NHL risk that increased to a 1.22-fold (95% CI: 0.95, 1.57) higher risk when women with household passive smoking were excluded from the reference category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant dose responses were observed for lifetime cumulative smoking exposure (intensity and pack-years; both P 's for trend = 0.02) when women with household passive smoking were excluded from the reference category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among never smokers, NHL risk increased with increasing lifetime exposure to passive smoking (relative risk = 1.51 (95% CI: 1.03, 2.22) for &gt;40 years vs. â‰¤5 years of passive smoking; P for trend = 0.03), particularly for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (relative risk = 2.89 (95% CI: 1.23, 6.80); P for trend = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study provides evidence that smoking and passive smoking may influence NHL etiology, particularly for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
