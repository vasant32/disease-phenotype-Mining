<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a suitable method to measure <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to assess a LightCycler-based qPCR for t(14;18)(q32;q21)(IgH/bcl-2)-positive cells quantification in the context of clinical and morphopathological characteristics of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated with rituximab (R) in combination with conventional or high-dose chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 270 bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples collected from 52 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at diagnosis or at relapse before or sequentially during therapy were examined by qPCR and nested-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A greater amount of t(14;18)-positive cells was observed in BM in comparison with PB in 76% of paired samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence and number of t(14;18)-positive cells in BM and PB correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher numbers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were found in patients under non-remission compared with patients in clinical remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During non-remission, 10-fold higher numbers were measured at relapse than at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During remission, significantly higher levels were found in partial compared with complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During first-line therapy, R/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>/adriamycin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHOP) had higher in vivo purging ability than R/fludarabine/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> (FM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After R/high-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> (HAM) or R/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="3423">carmustine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>/melphalan (BEAM), the level of t(14;18)-positive cells dropped below the detection limit in 80% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LightCycler qPCR is a reliable method for quantitative molecular monitoring of t(14;18)-positive cells in BM and PB of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It reflects the clinical characteristics of patients and allows assessment of response to different treatment regimens on a molecular level </plain></SENT>
