<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>Hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus (HCV) has been postulated to be an etiological agent for lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas a high prevalence of HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) patients has been shown to exist in many geographical areas of high HCV prevalence, studies from other parts have not established any form of association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In India, there is a scarcity of data to show either a positive or a negative association between NHL and HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we determined the prevalence of HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in patients with NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 228 subjects were included, out of which, the number of newly diagnosed consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (NHL and CLL) were 57 [mean age, 48.7 years (range: 18-80)] and the control group consisted of 171 subjects [mean age, 48.6 years (range: 18-80)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used third generation enzyme immunoassay to detect HCV antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HCV <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was detected by nested RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 57 patients of NHL, 44 (77.2%) had high-grade disease (diffuse large B cell), 6 (10.5%) intermediate-grade (follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), and 7 (12.3%) low-grade (small lymphocytic); 26 patients had B symptoms at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the patient tested positive for antibody to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus (anti-HCV) while 1 patient (1.75%) tested positive for HCV <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the age- and sex- matched controls, 2 (1.17%) subjects tested positive for anti-HCV; both were also positive for HCV <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> is unlikely to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> in northern India and does not play a major role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
