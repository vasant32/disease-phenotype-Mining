<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) is a known inducer of proliferation and differentiation of cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage, and gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) is a known activator of mononuclear phagocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this Phase I clinical trial of combined therapy with M-CSF and gamma-IFN, 36 patients were treated with 14-day continuous infusions of M-CSF at doses ranging from 10 to 140 micrograms/kg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but five patients, gamma-IFN was administered by daily s.c. injection on days 8-14 of the M-CSF infusion at doses of 0.05 or 0.1 mg/m2/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 73 courses of M-CSF and 66 courses of gamma-IFN were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maximally tolerated dose combination was 120 micrograms/kg/day M-CSF, 0.1 mg/m2/day gamma-IFN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The addition of gamma-IFN did not alter the maximally tolerated dose of M-CSF therapy, although some additional toxicities were noted with combined therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the 140-micrograms/kg/day M-CSF dose level, grade 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> occurred in 2 of 3 patients, with a median platelet count nadir of 26,000/mm3 after 7-10 days of M-CSF infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At this dose level, there was one reversible grade 3 hepatic toxicity, and one grade 3 exacerbation of underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0006536'>obstructive lung disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> was observed at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> M-CSF dose levels exceeding 40 micrograms/kg/day, approaching 3-fold elevations at the 100-micrograms/kg/day M-CSF dose level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The induction of <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> was correlated with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the conclusion of therapy with 100 micrograms/kg/day M-CSF, 0.1 mg/m2/day gamma-IFN, 78% of peripheral blood monocytes expressed the low affinity Fc gamma receptor for aggregated immunoglobulin, Fc gamma RIII (CD16), and CD14 was expressed by only 36% of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This phenotype has been shown previously to be associated with cellular activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 35% of monocytes from patients treated with M-CSF therapy alone at the same dose expressed CD16 and 88% expressed CD14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A partial clinical response was noted in a patient with metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, and minor clinical responses were observed in patients with a diffuse/follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, and metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100522'>thymoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At M-CSF doses exceeding 20 micrograms/kg/day within the maximally tolerated dose range, gamma-IFN did not modulate the ability of M-CSF to reliably induce peripheral blood <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This study shows that M-CSF and gamma-IFN therapy induces the proliferation and differentiation of circulating mononuclear phagocytes </plain></SENT>
