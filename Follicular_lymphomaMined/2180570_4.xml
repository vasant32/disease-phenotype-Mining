<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The FL-218 and FL-318 cell lines were composed of cells in the hyperdiploid range, which had two and three or four 18q- chromosomes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These 18q- chromosomes were not distinguishable from an 18q- chromosome derived from t(14;18) since they exhibited the same banding pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis revealed that in both cell lines, breakage of the bcl-2 gene occurred within the major breakpoint cluster region and the truncated gene juxtaposed to an immunoglobulin heavy chain gene locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The autoradiographic intensity of the retained fragment each on 18q- chromosome was more enhanced than that of the translocated fragment on 14q+ chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the extra 18q- chromosome found in t(14;18)-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> does not arise from de novo independent t(14;18) but from duplication of a preexisting 18q- chromosome </plain></SENT>
