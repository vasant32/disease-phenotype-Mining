<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the extent of somatic hypermutation in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> kappa light chain variable region (V kappa) genes about which the available data is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA extracted from fresh frozen lymph node tissue of 14 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at diagnosis was subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification aimed at detecting clonal VH and VL (L: light chain) gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clonal V kappa gene rearrangements were detected in 10/14 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Amplified VH and V kappa genes of these 10 cases were directly sequenced by the dideoxy-chain termination method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, rearranged VH genes demonstrated numerous mutations clustering in the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), in keeping with previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The degree of divergence of the rearranged V kappa genes from the closest homologous germline V kappa genes varied significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, two patterns of mutations were observed: (i) in six cases (60%), mutations were most often of the replacement (R) type (changing the <z:chebi fb="94" ids="33709">aminoacid</z:chebi> sequence of the encoded <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi>) in the CDRs and of the silent (S) type (leaving the <z:chebi fb="94" ids="33709">aminoacid</z:chebi> sequence of the encoded <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> unchanged) in the framework regions (FWRs) resulting in R:S ratios significantly greater than would have occurred by chance: (ii) in four cases (40%), very few or no mutations were observed and the distribution of mutations as well as the R:S mutation ratios did not differ significantly from what would have occurred by chance alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings imply that, compared to their partner heavy chains, the kappa light chains of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> neoplastic B-cells' surface immunoglobulin (sIg): (i) are less affected by somatic hypermutation: (ii) play a less significant role in the antigen selection process </plain></SENT>
