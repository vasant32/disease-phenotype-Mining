<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using population-based registries, we studied the pattern of NHL in Chinese migrants to British Columbia (BC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL cases of Chinese descent diagnosed between 1980 and 1997 were retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age-standardized incidences were calculated by 5-year intervals in terms of age and calendar years and the relative rates were compared between the migrant, Hong Kong and BC populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The histological distribution of NHL was compared with 4500 consecutive NHL cases diagnosed in the two populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 211 cases of migrant NHL were identified, with an age-standardized incidence rate of 7.11 per 100 000 per year, compared with the Hong Kong and BC rates of 7.91 [standardized incidence ratio (SIR) = 0.86, P = 0.01] and 11.88 (SIR = 0.56, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The standardized rates of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> remained low, but the incidence of gastric and nasal natural killer/T <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in migrants were lower than expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genetic factors appeared to be stronger than environmental factors in governing the overall incidence of NHL in Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, certain subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> may show decreased rates in migrants because of environmental factors </plain></SENT>
