<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that plasma from patients with anaplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> kinase (ALK)-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> contains antibodies against the oncogenic kinase NPM-ALK protein characteristic of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether this reactivity represents a phenomenon unique to ALK-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> by screening plasma from patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> for antibodies to BCL-2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight out of 10 samples showed such reactivity (and in six cases gave specific staining of BCL-2-transfected cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As these findings suggest a new biochemical approach to the identification of oncogenic proteins in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we investigated whether antibodies present in patients with ALK-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> can precipitate NPM-ALK in quantities which should be sufficient for further analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that plasma samples from all10 patients studied immunoprecipitated NPM-ALK asaprotein visible in silver-stained <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23870">dodecyl</z:chebi> sulphatepolyacrylamide gels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally we demonstrated that NPM-ALK could be visualized more clearly if it were immunoprecipitated from extracts of cells in which newly synthesized proteins had been labelled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi> and then identified by autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a strategy for using patients' autoantibodies to screen for antibodies to other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-associated proteins </plain></SENT>
