<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In healthy individuals, the same translocation may also be found in a small fraction of peripheral blood lymphocytes, the biological significance of which is beginning to be explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Translocation prevalence and frequency are potential risk factors for developing NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we review the published data and describe recent and ongoing work on this promising biomarker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have a series of studies in four major areas: 1) t(14;18) prevalence and frequency in healthy individuals; 2) maturation of translocation-harboring cells; 3) effect of rituximab treatment on t(14;18) carriage; and 4) predictive and clonotypic relationship between t(14;18) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or other NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted to increase understanding of this crucial molecular event in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Potential applications include determination of elevated risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, early detection of disease, and identification of molecular targets for preventive interventions </plain></SENT>
