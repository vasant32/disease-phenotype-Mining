<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 16 cases analyzed expressed surface immunoglobulin (sIg) on both the FL and the tDL, though the immunophenotype of one case of FL could not be definitively determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 14 of 15 cases, the surface immunophenotype was preserved; the exception was likely secondary to a class switch from IgM to IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 12 of 13 cases, antiidiotypic monoclonal antibodies prepared against the FL reacted with the paired tDL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of Ig gene rearrangements in four cases by Southern blot hybridization showed evidence of clonal relationships in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases though concordance was not seen with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> probes tested (C kappa, C lambda, JH, PFL1, and PFL2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the one case that had a discordant L chain rearrangement, sequence analysis of the L chain demonstrated a common mature B cell origin for both the FL and tDL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To determine whether tDL arose from one or more FL cells, the sequences of the H chain variable genes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Individual clones of the V region gene of the FL showed a random distribution of changes throughout the sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, individual clones of the V region gene from tDL shared numerous nonrandom sequence alterations, implying a common single cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, tDL is a mature B cell and arises by transformation of a single FL cell </plain></SENT>
