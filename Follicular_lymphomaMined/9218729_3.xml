<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five (59%) patients were bcl-2/J(H) positive and 24 (41%) were negative in the peripheral blood at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood bcl-2/J(H) rearrangement detection at diagnosis had no relation to overall survival (OS) and time to progression (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood PCR assay was performed post treatment in 17 patients who were bcl-2/J(H) positive at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of the patients (82%, 95% CI 56-96%) became bcl-2/J(H) negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine of these patients were further analysed during follow-up and, after several months, circulating cells carrying the bcl-2/J(H) rearrangement reappeared in five of the nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood clearance of bcl-2/J(H)-positive cells was correlated with better overall survival (log-rank P &lt; 0.05) but not with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data confirmed that bcl-2(MBR)/J(H) rearrangement detection by PCR at diagnosis is not a prognostic factor in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our series, clearance of circulating bcl-2/J(H)-positive cells appeared to correlate with better overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Post-treatment examination of the peripheral blood by PCR may have clinical relevance for prediction of the survival pattern of the patients </plain></SENT>
