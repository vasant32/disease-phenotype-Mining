<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissue, centroblasts uniformly expressed high levels of Mcl-1 (Mcl-1(hi)) whereas centrocytes demonstrated low Mcl-1 expression (Mcl-1(lo)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 expression in centroblasts/centrocytes was reciprocal to Mcl-1 staining in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A high number of Mcl-1(hi) centroblasts in tissue sections (&gt; or =200/high-power field) correlated with poor overall survival (P &lt; 0.001), independent of the International Prognostic Index and FL grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the number of centroblasts with strong Mcl-1 staining is associated with clinical outcome in FL patients </plain></SENT>
