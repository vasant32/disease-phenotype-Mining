<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After eight courses of CHOP therapy, she achieved a complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In November 1998, her FL relapsed, and she achieved a second CR after two courses of MINE therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> was used for autologous peripheral stem cell mobilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In May 1999, she underwent high-dose chemotherapy with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (auto-PBSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four months after the auto-PBSCT, bilateral cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> developed </plain></SENT>
