<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine this question further, a polymerase chain reaction strategy has been devised to permit the amplification and direct sequencing of the resultant 14q+ and 18q- reciprocal junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Direct sequence analysis of amplified 14q+ junctions established that 7 of 11 tumors contained a bcl-2 (mbr) sequence fused to an immunoglobulin JH region (five were J6 and two were J5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of these junctions had an unusual configuration with the bcl-2 and JH sequences separated by a recognizable DH region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that at least some of the junctional sequences, previously thought of as N insertions, may be fragments of unrecognized DH regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was also possible to amplify and sequence 18q- junctions using a primer based on the DH recombination signal sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several 18q- junctions were shown to consist of DH/bcl-2 (either mbr or mcr) fusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> the 14q+ and 18q- junctions were fully sequenced, and it was demonstrated that the bcl-2 sequence was conserved during mbr and mcr translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This contrasts with previous analyses that demonstrated either loss or duplication of several bases at the breakpoints in the bcl-2 gene </plain></SENT>
