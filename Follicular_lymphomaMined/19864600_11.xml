<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our previous work has demonstrated that human follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) infiltrating T cells are anergic, in part due to suppression by regulatory T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we identify pericellular <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>, interacting with T cell-associated G protein-coupled A(2A/B) <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> receptors (AR), as contributing to FL T cell hyporesponsiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a subset of FL patient samples, treatment of lymph node mononuclear cells (LNMC) with specific A(2A/B) AR <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> results in an increase in IFN-gamma or IL-2 secretion upon anti-CD3/CD28 Ab stimulation, as compared with that seen without inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, treatment with an A(1) AR <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> had no effect on cytokine secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As the rate limiting step for <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> generation from pericellular ATP is the ecto-ATPase CD39, we next show that inhibition of CD39 activity using the inhibitor ARL 67156 partially overcomes T cell hyporesponsiveness in a subset of patient samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic characterization of LNMC demonstrates populations of CD39-expressing CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, which are overrepresented in FL as compared with that seen in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or reactive nodes, or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty percent of the FL CD4(+)CD39(+) T cells coexpress CD25(high) and FOXP3 (consistent with regulatory T cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, FL or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LNMC hydrolyze ATP in vitro, in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, with the rate of ATP consumption being associated with the degree of CD39(+) T cell infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together, these results support the finding that the ATP-ectonucleotidase-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> system mediates T cell anergy in a human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, these studies suggest that the A(2A/B) AR as well as CD39 are novel pharmacological targets for augmenting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
