<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Among the 566 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) included in the GELF 86 prospective trials from October 1986 to September 1995, 372 with progressive/relapsing disease were analyzed retrospectively to identify prognostic factors at first relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: For progressive FL, patients received mono- (22%) or polychemotherapy (78%) followed by high-dose therapy (HDT) with ASCT for 83 patients (22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median time to progression from initial treatment was 23 months (range 3-102 months) and 24% of documented patients (52 of 217) had histological transformation (HT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Salvage therapy produced an overall response in 64% of patients and the five-year survival from progression was 42% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For patients who underwent HDT with ASCT compared to standard treatment, five-year freedom from second failure was at 42% vs. 16% (P = 0.0001) and five-year survival was 58% vs. 38% (P = 0.0005), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The benefit of HDT and ASCT remained if we consider only patients less than 65 years (five-year survival at 60% vs. 40%; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis of parameters significant according to univariate analysis found that no ASCT at first progression, age at relapse &gt; 50 years, progression on-therapy were adversely significant on survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HDTwith ASCT compared to standard treatment prolonged remission and survival after first progression of FL patients </plain></SENT>
