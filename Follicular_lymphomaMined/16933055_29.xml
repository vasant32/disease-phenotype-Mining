<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Because of conflicting findings about the relationship between ultraviolet (UV) radiation and the risk of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), we evaluated the risk of several indicators related to UV, including two not previously studied: dietary <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>, and ambient UV levels by residential location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: As part of a case-control study conducted in four Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries, we collected UV information from a self-administered questionnaire and computer-assisted personal interview with 551 NHL cases and 462 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We estimated the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) from unconditional logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eye color, a marker of host susceptibility to UV, showed a decreasing risk gradient for lightest eyes (0.47) compared to darkest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative risks were in the range of 0.73-0.78 for participants reporting more hours in the mid-day summer sun </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Use of sunlamps or tanning booths was associated with decreased risk (RR = 0.88), as was estimated overall ambient UV (RR = 0.76 per 50 RB-units) overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">Vitamin D</z:chebi> intake from diet and supplements was not related to risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results were thus consistent for the various indicators, although some estimated risks were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Effects were generally similar for diffuse large B-cell (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest a slight protective effect of sunlight against NHL, and they agree with geographic patterns of NHL incidence observed in the US </plain></SENT>
