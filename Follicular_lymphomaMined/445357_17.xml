<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study we have analyzed a group of 86 consecutive previously untreated patients with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in order to determine those factors which adversely effect survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two percent of these patients are still living; 23 patients for greater than 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 38% have died; 28% of them within 24 months of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Striking correlations with short survival were seen with histiocytic cell type, Ann Arbor B symptoms and advanced age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival also declined with advanced stage but was A or B symptom dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The group was further subdivided into those with exclusively nodular and those with mixed nodular and diffuse histology in order to determine whether the presence of a diffuse component had a negative influence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found in survival patterns between these 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results clearly define a subgroup of nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients with a poor prognosis which is likely to benefit most from aggressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients are surviving for longer periods of time (albeit many not disease free) and the appropriate treatment for this group remains controversial </plain></SENT>
