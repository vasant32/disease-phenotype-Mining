<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Defining the role of high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell rescue in the therapeutic algorithm of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> remains a major challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the acknowledged poor outcome associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>/total body irradiation conditioning in heavily pretreated patients, the prognostic impact of the number of previous therapy lines in patients treated with the chemotherapy-only containing regimen, BEAM, is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From 1997 to 2008 80 patients (41 males, 39 females; median age, 51 years; range, 31-67) received high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell rescue with BEAM for relapsed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall survival and time-to-progression were analyzed according to the number of prior treatment lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median number of previous treatment lines was three, with 61% of the patients having received more than three lines (including rituximab in 47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 76 months (range, 14-160), three patients developed secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall survival rate was 71% and 5-year time-to-progression was 44% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in time-to-progression or overall survival according to the number of previous treatment lines or episodes of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell rescue with BEAM appears to be equally effective in second or third remission of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
