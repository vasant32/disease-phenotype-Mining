<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case of composite <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> consisting of an anaplastic large-cell Ki-1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and a small-cell follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was found in the splenic hilar lymph node of a 66-year-old woman </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Ki-1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed monoclonal IgM-lambda and CD 20, CD 74, and CDw 75 antigens by immunostaining and CD 19, CD 20, CD 22, and lambda antigens by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> also showed monoclonal IgM-lambda, and CD 20 and CDw 75 antigens but not CD 74 and CD 30 (Ki-1) by immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis of the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> component was not conclusive, as it was impossible to separate the neoplastic from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> small B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ki-1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> usually is seen in childhood and is mostly of T cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is, therefore, unusual to find Ki-1 antigen component in a composite <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of B-cell origin in an adult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there has been evidence to suggest that B-cell Ki-1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> may be related to follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, our case may represent a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> transforming into a Ki-1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunogenotyping in this case revealed that the two components were probably of the same clonal origin, as they seemed to share the same light chain gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of rearrangement in the switch region of the IgH in our case without the actual occurrence of heavy chain switching may have triggered somatic recombination in the IgH complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This series of events may have led to the transformation of a low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> into a high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, accounting for the two morphologic patterns seen in our bimorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
