<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that a stronger host immune system prior to rituximab therapy for follicular (grades 1and 2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) would result in better response rates and longer time to progression (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we studied the role of absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) prior to rituximab therapy on treatment efficacy and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> in FL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between 1996 and 2002, 79 FL patients were treated with single agent rituximab during their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treatment at the Mayo Clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age of the cohort was 56.6 years (range: 25-98 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> was 12.5 months (range: 1-76 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Superior <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> was observed with an ALC &gt; or =0.89 x 10(9)/l (n = 40) compared with an ALC &lt;0.89 x 10(9)/l (n = 39) at the time of rituximab therapy (median: 36.5 vs. 8.1 months, respectively, P &lt; 0.0009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher complete response rates were observed in the ALC &gt; or =0.89 x 10(9)/l (23/40, 58%) compared with the ALC &lt;0.89 x 10(9)/l (5/39, 13%) (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed ALC to be an independent predictor for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study supports our hypothesis that a higher ALC predicts longer <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> following rituximab therapy </plain></SENT>
