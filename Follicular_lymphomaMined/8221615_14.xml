<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new human B-cell line, WSU-FSCCL, was established from the peripheral blood of a patient with low-grade follicular small cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in leukemic phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both the fresh <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and the established cell line exhibit t(14;18)(q32;q21) and t(8;11)(q24;q21) chromosomal translocations, 6q-, 1p+, and +i(1q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PCR analysis confirmed the juxtaposition of the major breakpoint-cluster region of bcl-2 with immunoglobulin heavy chain (JH) gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Southern analysis demonstrated that the 8q24 breakpoint was 5' of c-myc exon 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The new line grows as a single-cell suspension with a doubling time of approximately 26 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It expresses cytoplasmic and cell surface IgM-kappa and reacts with monoclonal antibodies to B-cell antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cells are negative for T-cell and myeloid/monocyte antigens as well as for Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DNA histogram generated by flow cytometry indicated a near diploid stemline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While t(14;18) is common in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the t(8;11) is unusual in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, although it does involve a region frequently aberrant on chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rearrangement of c-myc may have conferred an aggressive clinical behavior seen in the terminal phase of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The role of 11q21 remains undetermined </plain></SENT>
