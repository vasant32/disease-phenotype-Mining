<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated NHL risk associated with genetic variation in pattern-recognition genes using data from a case-control study of NHL conducted in Connecticut women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 27 pattern-recognition genes were genotyped in 432 Caucasian incident NHL cases and 494 frequency-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unconditional logistic regression was used to compute odds ratios (ORs) for NHL and common NHL subtypes in relation to individual SNPs and haplotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A gene-based analysis that adjusted for the number of tagSNPs genotyped in each gene showed a significant association with overall NHL for the MBP gene (P = 0.028), with the diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) subtype for the MASP2 gene (P = 0.011), and with the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) subtype for DEFB126 (P = 0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A SNP-based analysis showed that MBP rs8094402 was associated with decreased risks of overall NHL (allele risk OR = 0.72, P-trend = 0.0018), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (allele risk OR = 0.72, P-trend = 0.036), and FL (allele risk OR = 0.67, P-trend = 0.021), while MASP2 rs12711521 was associated with a decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (allele risk OR = 0.57, P-trend = 0.0042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also observed an increased risk of FL for DEFB126 rs6054706 (allele risk OR = 1.39, P-trend = 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that genetic variation in pattern-recognition genes is associated with the risk of NHL or specific NHL subtypes, but these preliminary findings require replication in larger studies </plain></SENT>
