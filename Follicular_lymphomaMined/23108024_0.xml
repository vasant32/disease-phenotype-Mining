<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), a common <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in adults, occurs rarely in pediatric and young adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most pediatric cases have been described as grade 3, but the criteria to distinguish the pediatric variant of FL (PFL) from usual FL (UFL) seen in adults are not well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We undertook a study of FL in patients under the age of 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified 63 cases, which were analyzed by <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, immunohistochemistry, and polymerase chain reaction analysis of IGH@ and IGK@ clonality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data were correlated with clinical findings including stage, treatment, and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 63 cases, 34 cases were classified as PFL: 22 presenting in lymph nodes, 8 in the Waldeyer ring, and 4 in the testis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangement was detected in 97% of PFL cases, but fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed an absence of the BCL2/IGH@ translocation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine cases were classified as UFL, 28 of which presented in lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The nodal PFLs were observed exclusively in male patients in both children and young adults with a median age of 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They showed marked head/neck predilection, blastoid cytologic features with a high proliferation rate, lack of BCL2 protein and t(14;18), low clinical stage at presentation, and good prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PFLs involving the Waldeyer ring were distinguished by MUM1 expression, 50% (3/6) of which carried IRF4 breaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>BCL2 expression was common (63%) in the absence of BCL2/IGH@ translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>UFLs were more common in female patients, exclusively in young adults (median age, 24 y), with no cases reported in patients under the age of 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five of 29 cases were of grade 1-2, and 4 cases were classified as grade 3A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>They exhibited a higher clinical stage at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Eighty-three percent expressed BCL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that histologic and immunophenotypic criteria can reliably separate PFL and UFL and that UFL is exceptionally rare in the pediatric age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>PFL associated with particular anatomic sites have distinctive features and should be evaluated separately in future clinical and biological studies </plain></SENT>
