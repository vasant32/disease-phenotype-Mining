<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We conducted a phase I study to determine the safety, maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), and efficacy of weekly bolus recombinant human interleukin-21 (rIL-21) plus rituximab in patients with indolent B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: One week after a lead-in rituximab dose, cohorts of three patients were treated with 30, 100, or 150 μg/kg rIL-21 weekly for four weeks, concurrent with four weekly doses of rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with stable disease or better were eligible for a second course of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-one patients with relapsed small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>/CLL, n = 11), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 9), or marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 1) were enrolled, with 19 completing at least one course of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MTD for rIL-21 was 100 μg/kg, based on observed toxicities including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002148'>hypophosphatemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical responses were seen in 8 of 19 evaluable patients (42%; 3 CR/CRu, 5 PR), with 4 of longer duration than the patient's previous response to rituximab-based treatment (median 9 months vs. 3 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient therapy of indolent B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> with rituximab and weekly rIL-21 was well tolerated and clinically active, with durable complete remissions in a small subset of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional studies of rIL-21 and anti-CD20 antibodies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>/CLL are warranted </plain></SENT>
