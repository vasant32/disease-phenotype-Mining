<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to overcome the difficulty in identifying bcl-2 protein in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections, its antigenicity was retrieved by a variety of pretreatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The heating pretreatment by hydrated autoclaving was the best method for retrieving the antigenicity, and deionized water was the most adequate solution for soaking sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This antigen retrieval sequence was helpful to examine the localization of bcl-2 protein in archival sections of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
