<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified multiple gene loci whose DNA methylation patterns differed between 3 types of SBCL: B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and grades I and II follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This analysis was performed using an oligonucleotide microarray that allowed determination of the DNA methylation status of 156 loci in 38 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> restriction analysis and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction were used to validate the differential methylation of 6 of these genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By using non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines as models, these genes were examined further for methylation and gene expression relationships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study illustrates nonrandom epigenetic alterations in SBCLs that seem to preferentially involve <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of germinal center derivation </plain></SENT>
