<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The time-consuming process required to generate patient-specific vaccines is a major limitation, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report results of a pilot clinical trial with a novel autologous, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-derived proteoliposome vaccine formulation that could be rapidly produced within a single day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vaccination was safe, induced autologous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific type 1 cytokine responses in 5 out of 10 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, and was associated with induction of a sustained complete response in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other patients had large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burdens and progressed after a median duration of 8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that further testing of this vaccine formulation, particularly in the setting of minimal disease, is warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the proteoliposome formulation may provide a model for vaccine development for other human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, for which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated antigens need not be defined </plain></SENT>
