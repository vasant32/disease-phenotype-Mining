<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patients who were enrolled in the phase 3 first-line indolent trial were 18 y or older, with CD20(+) grade 1 or 2 stage III or IV FL, and a partial response, complete response, or unconfirmed complete response to first-line chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were allocated randomly to receive a single infusion of unlabeled rituximab 250 mg/m(2) on day -7 and consolidation on day 0 with a single dose of (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan, 14.8 MBq/kg, immediately after unlabeled rituximab, 250 mg/m(2), or no further treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On day -7, a subset of patients received an injection of 185 MBq of (111)In-ibritumomab tiuxetan immediately after unlabeled rituximab, 250 mg/m(2), for central dosimetry analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correlations were assessed between organ radiation absorbed dose and toxicity, body weight, body mass index, and progression-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Central dosimetry evaluations were available from 57 of 70 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median radiation absorbed doses were 100 cGy (range, 28-327 cGy) for the red marrow and 72 cGy (range, 46-106 cGy) for the whole body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Radiation absorbed doses did not differ significantly between patients who had a partial response or complete response to initial therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival correlated significantly with the whole-body (r = 0.4401; P = 0.0006) and bone marrow (r = 0.2976; P = 0.0246) radiation dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Body weight was significantly negatively correlated with whole-body radiation dose (r = -0.4971; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neither the whole-body radiation dose nor the bone marrow radiation dose correlated with hematologic toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with low or minimal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumor</z:e> burden after first-line chemotherapy of advanced FL, whole-body and bone marrow exposure after (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan consolidation showed a significant positive correlation with progression-free survival, whereas dosimetric data could not predict hematologic toxicity </plain></SENT>
