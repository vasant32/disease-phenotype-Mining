<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up in large series is therefore necessary to establish whether cure is taking place, and if so, at what stage in the dissemination of the disease process it becomes unlikely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The time to, and site of relapse, together with its impact on survival has been studied in 398 patients entered into the British National <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Investigation limited and disseminated disease trials between 1974 and 1980 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relapse data were compared with various models to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the proportions permanently remaining relapse-free following treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Long-term relapse-free survival was observed in 54.8 +/- 14.9% (95% CI) of patients at 15 years with Ann Arbor stage I disease, 29.2 +/- 13.6% in patients with stage II disease, 18.1 +/- 6.6% with stage III and 13.0 +/- 5.9% with IV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relapse time-course data for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> trial arms conform closely to lognormal distributions allowing maximum likelihood estimates of proportions remaining permanently relapse-free to be derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using this methodology, over a quarter of patients treated with involved radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy plus 6 months of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> in the limited disease (Ann Arbor stage I and II) trial are unlikely to relapse at any time in the future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over 10% of patients treated in the disseminated disease trials with disease classified as Ann Arbor stage III are also statistically unlikely to relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The finding that a proportion of patients is statistically unlikely to experience a clinically obvious relapse is consistent with clinical cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is especially interesting that a small proportion of patients with disseminated disease and treated by chemotherapy have fallen into this category, but additional data are required to know at what point statistical cure becomes unlikely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whether "clinical cure" is the same as "pathological cure" in this disease remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
