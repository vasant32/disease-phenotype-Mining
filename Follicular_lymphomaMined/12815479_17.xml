<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The secondary goal was to evaluate the efficacy of Rituximab as an in vivo purging agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 23 patients had been treated with CHOP followed by either high-dose therapy (12 patients) or high-dose plus Rituximab (11 patients), both followed by autologous transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results show that 86% of harvests from patients treated with Rituximab were PCR-negative compared to 14.3% from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Real-time PCR was more sensitive than Genescan PCR; quantitative analysis revealed a correlation between the amount of contamination in the harvests and relapse after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients reinfused with negative aphereses achieved complete remission and showed a significantly better 5-year PFS (100%) compared to those reinfused with contaminated samples (41%), a very low amount of contamination does not appear to negatively affect outcome, suggesting that determination of a cutoff in the contamination level of harvests could be useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that real-time PCR is superior to Genescan PCR to select transplantable harvests and confirm the ability of Rituximab as an in vivo purging tool for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
