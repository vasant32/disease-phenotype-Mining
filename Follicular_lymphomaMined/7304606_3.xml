<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In each case, a morphologically distinct population of cells with large, irregular nuclei was present, the percentage of which corresponded to the percentage of tetraploid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a fourth case (diffuse "histiocytic" <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), cells were sorted on the basis of DNA content from the G0-G1 compartment and compared morphologically to cells sorted from the S-G2(M) compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The G0-G1 cells has clumped nuclear chromatin, lacked prominent nucleoli, and had a mean nuclear diameter of 10.18 +/- 1.22 micrometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sorted cells with S-G2 (M) DNA content had one to several prominent nucleoli and less clumped nuclear chromatin, and they were significantly larger, with a mean nuclear diameter of 13.76 +/- 1.59 micrometer (p less than 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These preliminary results suggest that, in lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, certain morphologic characteristics of individual lymphoid cells are related to their DNA content (level of ploidy) and/or the stage of the cell within its division cycle </plain></SENT>
