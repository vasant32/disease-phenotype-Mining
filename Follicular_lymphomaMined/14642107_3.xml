<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the practical application of the WHO classification of lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, and to investigate the relative frequency and geographic distribution of the subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The pathological specimens of 304 cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosed during the period 1994 approximately 2002 in the First Hospital of Peking University were retrospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The histopathologic, immunophenotypic and clinical data were reviewed and reappraisal was performed according to the WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 20 cases (6.6%) of Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>) and 284 cases (93.4%) of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the 284 NHL cases, B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> accounted for 60.2% and T/NK-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> for 39.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On subtyping, diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, extranodal NK/T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of nasal type, unspecified peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, extranodal marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of MALT type, angioimmunoblastic T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were the most common 6 subtypes and amounted to 88.03% of NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distribution of NHL subtype in this group showed important difference from those in some areas in the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extranodal NK/T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of nasal type and other peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had a higher frequency, but B-small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were less common in this group than in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The new WHO classification may be applicable to the diagnosis and subtyping of most <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, making the pathological diagnosis easier to practise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A correct diagnosis of ML may be reached by combination of clinic, histological and immunological features </plain></SENT>
