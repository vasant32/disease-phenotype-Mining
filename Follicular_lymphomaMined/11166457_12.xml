<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In follicle center <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FCL), most approaches eradicate polymerase chain reaction (PCR);-detectable disease in only a fraction of harvests undergoing ex vivo manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we evaluated whether there is a relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden of stem cell harvests and successful clearance of PCR-detectable disease following ex vivo manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: To address this issue, we developed a real-time PCR approach for quantitative measurement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> contamination using the bcl-2 rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Real-time PCR was used to evaluate the relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden of stem-cell harvests and purging effectiveness in PCR(+) samples derived from 10 FCL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ex vivo purging was performed using the MaxSep cell separator (Baxter Immunotherapy, Deerfield, IL, USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our real-time PCR method proved effective, sensitive, accurate, and reproducible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four collections were successfully cleared of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) whereas six remained PCR(+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Real-time PCR showed that the four collections successfully cleared of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> had a prepurging <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden significantly lower than those remaining PCR(+) (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study provides the first evidence that evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden in stem-cell harvests by real-time PCR can predict the effectiveness of therapeutic intervention in non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, we foresee a more widespread use of this technique to evaluate the impact of different therapeutic approaches in FCL </plain></SENT>
