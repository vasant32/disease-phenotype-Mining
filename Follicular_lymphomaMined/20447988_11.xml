<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several studies have suggested an association between occupational exposure to solvents and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, findings are inconsistent and the role of specific chemicals is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Objective To investigate the role of occupational exposure to organic solvents in the aetiology of B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B-NHL) and its major subtypes, as well as Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 2348 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases and 2462 controls participated in a case-control study in six European countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A subset of cases were reviewed by a panel of pathologists to ensure diagnostic consistency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exposure to solvents was assessed by industrial hygienists and occupational experts based on a detailed occupational questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Risk of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> significantly increased with three independent metrics of exposure to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17578">toluene</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27338">xylene</z:chebi> (BTX) (combined p=4 x 10(-7)) and to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27452">styrene</z:chebi> (p=1 x 10(-5)), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (CLL) risk increased with exposure to solvents overall (p=4 x 10(-6)), BTX (p=5 x 10(-5)), gasoline (p=8 x 10(-5)) and other solvents (p=2 x 10(-6)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk of B-NHL for ever exposure to solvents was not elevated (OR=1.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.3), and that for CLL and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was 1.3 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.6) and 1.3 (95% CI 1.0 to 1.7), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exposure to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> accounted, at least partially, for the association observed with CLL risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> did not show an association with solvent exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This analysis of a large European dataset confirms a role of occupational exposure to solvents in the aetiology of B-NHL, and particularly, CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> is most likely to be implicated, but we cannot exclude the possibility of a role for other solvents in relation to other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes, such as follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No association with risk of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was shown </plain></SENT>
