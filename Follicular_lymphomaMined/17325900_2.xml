<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PET revealed additional initial nodes suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, that were of less than 10 mm of diameter on computed tomography, and documented disease progression with sensitivity, even within loci with no significant variations of CT findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although tracer fixation was not observed in the inguinal nodes draining the dendritic cell intradermal injection sites in the six patients, a transient marked increase in FDG uptake within malignant nodes was observed early after vaccine administration in a patient who achieved complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In non-responding patients, we observed a continuous increase of FDG uptake associated with an increase in the size and number of pathological nodes/locus, or of involved loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FDG-PET is a non-invasive imaging procedure that might be of crucial interest to detect cell responses induced by immunotherapies </plain></SENT>
