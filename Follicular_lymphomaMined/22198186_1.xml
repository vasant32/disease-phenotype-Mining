<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Retrospective descriptive analysis of response and side effects of bendamustine in eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and eight patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data was collated from a review of case records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We examined any association between side effects and clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age of patients was 52 years and three-quarters had received prior treatment with alkylators or fludarabine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three different protocols of bendamustine were used (single agent, in combination with rituximab or in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 80% (47% complete response, 33% partial response, and 20% progressive disease) </plain></SENT>
