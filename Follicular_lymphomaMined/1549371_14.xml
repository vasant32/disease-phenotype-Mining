<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The majority of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells carry the typical chromosome translocation 14;18, which juxtaposes the bcl-2 gene to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Variant translocations of the bcl-2 gene to the Ig lambda or Ig kappa gene have been found by molecular biological techniques in a significant fraction (approximately 10%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there have been no reports describing the presence of cytogenetic 18;22 and 2;18 translocations in CLL, in spite of extensive karyotypic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present here two cases of CLL, one with cytogenetically detected t(2;18)(p11;q21) and the other with the t(18;22)(q21;q11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The molecular analysis revealed that these translocations juxtaposed the bcl-2 and immunoglobulin light-chain (IgL) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The t(18;22) broke the 5' flanking region of the bcl-2 gene and juxtaposed to the immunoglobulin lambda light-chain (Ig lambda) gene in a head-to-head configuration, as in the cases previously described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the case of the t(2;18), the bcl-2 gene and immunoglobulin kappa light-chain (Ig kappa) gene were juxtaposed in a head-to-tail configuration, which is opposite to that expected from the orientation of the genes on chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint was located within the 5' untranslated region of the bcl-2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results presented here indicate that the bcl-2/immunoglobulin light-chain (IgL) gene juxtaposition seen in a fraction of CLL is the result of cytogenetically detectable reciprocal chromosome translocations 2;18 and 18;22 </plain></SENT>
