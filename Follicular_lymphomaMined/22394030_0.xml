<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have suggested that the immune-microenvironment of FL plays an important role in the clinical behaviour of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of the microenvironment in BM involvement of FL, we performed immunophenotypical analysis of the reactive cell populations in lymph nodes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>) and corresponding BM of 35 patients with FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microenvironment patterns of BM infiltrates were compared to the corresponding features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> in cases with BM manifestation, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> microenvironment was compared in FL cases with and without BM involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS:   Automated image-segmentation-based quantitation was performed in whole digital slides of tissue microarrays of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found significantly more CD8(+) T lymphocytes, forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3)(+) T lymphocytes and CD68(+) macrophages and fewer PD1(+) T lymphocytes in the BM than in the matching <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we observed significantly fewer CD8(+) T cells and CD68(+) macrophages in cases involving the BM compared to those localized only to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:   Our study showed that different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell growth in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> and BM may generate different microenvironments, and suggested that the reduced number of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and macrophages in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> favours BM infiltration of neoplastic cells in FL </plain></SENT>
