<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To establish the role of immunohistochemistry (using a limited panel of antibodies) in detecting minimal involvement by follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in routinely processed bone marrow trephine specimens, which show no obvious morphological (light microscopic) evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; to determine whether bcl-2 immunostaining in bone marrow distinguishes between benign and malignant infiltrates in a patient with nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty seven consecutively selected paraffin wax embedded, formalin fixed bone marrow trephine specimens were stained with the following antibodies: anti-bcl-2, anti-CD79a, anti-CD3, and kappa and lambda light chains, using the Streptavidin <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> complex technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five of the 27 cases, which showed no evidence of involvement by follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> on routine stains, showed monotypic B cells on immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of the cases were diffuse, while the remaining three showed mini-aggregates around bony trabeculae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five cases the lymphomatous infiltrates were strongly bcl-2 positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reactive B lymphoid nodules did not show the same degree of bcl-2 positivity, and negative cells could be discerned within the reactive nodules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is merit in studying so-called negative bone marrows immunohistochemically in order to detect minimal involvement by follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A limited panel of antibodies including anti-bcl-2, anti-CD79a and anti-CD3 is usually adequate to accomplish this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Strongly bcl-2 positive lymphoid aggregates in the bone marrow of patients with nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are indicative of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
