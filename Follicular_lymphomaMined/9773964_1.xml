<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The malignant "follicles" have an unusual "floral" appearance due to the proliferation of surrounding and infiltrating small lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This variant of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has been supported by immunohistochemical immunophenotyping and gene-rearrangement studies; however, the flow cytometric findings have not previously been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the flow cytometric findings in two cases of FL-F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The surrounding and infiltrating small lymphocytes represented mantle cells which, in one case, obscured monoclonality in the lymphocyte region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The monoclonal B-cells were CD10+, supporting a follicular center cell origin </plain></SENT>
