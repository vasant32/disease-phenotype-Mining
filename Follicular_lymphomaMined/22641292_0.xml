<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed 97 consecutive patients with FL (n = 46), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> associated with FL (n = 22), or de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (n = 29) who received allo-HCT at our institute between 2000 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 53 months, the 5-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were, respectively, 77% and 70% for FL, 62% and 57% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> associated with FL, and 26% and 23% for de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 5-year cumulative incidences of non-relapse mortality and disease progression/relapse were, respectively, 16% and 15% for FL, 19% and 24% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> associated with FL, and 36% and 41% for de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By a multivariate analysis, the OS and PFS for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> associated with FL were significantly better than those for de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, whereas they were not significantly different from those for FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that allo-HCT may be a promising option for patients with not only advanced FL but also <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> associated with FL </plain></SENT>
