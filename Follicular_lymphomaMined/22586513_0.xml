<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, for example, combination of chemotherapy and rituximab (immuno-chemotherapy) and consecutive maintenance therapy for 2 years is the current standard of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, the most widely used regimen seems to be rituximab combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (R-CHOP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Substitution of liposomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> in place of conventional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> may improve outcomes in this indication, although evidence for its use in low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is not as relevant as in aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bendamustine, in combination with rituximab, has shown very good efficacy and tolerability in several <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> types, particularly follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and other low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other combinations, such as those including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> and lenalidomide, are under investigation in low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and the duration of rituximab maintenance therapy following bendamustine-rituximab-containing induction is being researched by the German Study Group for Indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (StiL) </plain></SENT>
