<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects completed a validated food-frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up time of 10 years, we identified 939 incident NHL cases through linkages with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> registries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patterns, "Vegetables,""Fruit and Milk," and "Fat and Meat," were analyzed using Cox regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the patterns was significantly associated with the risk of NHL in the total population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the Vegetables pattern was inversely related to risk in Caucasian women with a hazard ratio of 0.56 (P(trend) = 0.04), and the Fat and Meat pattern was associated with a fivefold higher risk of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in men (P(trend) = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lack of significant results in men and women indicates a limited role of diet in NHL etiology, but dietary patterns might have ethnic- and subgroup-specific effects on NHL </plain></SENT>
