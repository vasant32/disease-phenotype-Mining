<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The stimultaneous study using the two classifications showed that entities defined in one of them do not correspond to entities defined in the other one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>--This study allows us to define: 1) in Kiel's classification, a <z:chebi fb="98" ids="24433">groupe</z:chebi> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of favorable prognosis, by opposition with a group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of poor progonosis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages included; 2) in Rappaport's classification, a group of nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of favorable prognosis, for which the actuarial survival curves, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages included, seem to accord with the anatomico-clinical data thus far published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, while nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> can be identified as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of favorable prognosis, it does not seem possible to isolate, in Rappaport's classification, a group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of poor prognosis by opposition with the favorable prognosis group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study confirms that, to the morphological entity of the malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> centrocytic follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, there corresponds a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of favorable prognosis whose median is 72 months, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages included, for an average age of 57.5 years (this median is more than 180 months in the clinically localized stages) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This morphological entity of Kiel covers 76 per cent of Rappaport's malignant nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, 24 per cent of these same malignant nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are considered to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of poor prognosis by Kiel and seem to appear as such in our study </plain></SENT>
