<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="45906">Suramin</z:chebi> was administered at an initial infusion rate of 350 mg/m2/day, which was then modified on the basis of subsequent weekly plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45906">suramin</z:chebi> concentrations in order to reach a final plasma concentrations of 250-350 micrograms/ml </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five of nine evaluable patients achieved a partial remission as defined by a greater than 50% decrease in the sum of the product of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measurable lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sites of response include: Peripheral (five patients) and central (four patients) <z:mp ids='MP_0000702'>adenopathy</z:mp>, disappearance of biopsy-proven skin involvement (one patient), malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusions</z:hpo> (one patient) and shrinkage of an <z:mp ids='MP_0000691'>enlarged spleen</z:mp> (two patients) </plain></SENT>
