<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the reported frequencies of t(14;18) in FL show significant variation, which is often attributed to geographical and/or methodological factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The methods used to detect t(14;18) include Southern blotting, conventional cytogenetics, fluorescent in situ hybridization, and polymerized chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of its practicality and superior sensitivity, PCR is becoming the more commonly used method in clinical laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The identification of the main breakpoint regions on chromosome 18, including the major breakpoint region (MBR), the minor cluster region (mcr), and the newly defined intermediate cluster region (icr), increased the detection frequency of PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In our study, using a highly sensitive nested PCR strategy with primers for MBR, mcr and icr regions, we were able to detect t(14;18) in 95% of FL patients, which is one of the highest reported frequencies using PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We screened 58 FL patient samples collected retrospectively from different hospitals in Jordan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from archival paraffin-embedded samples, some of which were &gt;10 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The respective breakpoint distributions were, 47 for MBR (81%), two for mcr (3.5%) and six for icr (10.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this report, we analyze this high frequency of t(14;18) detection in a general review of the recent literature, in an attempt to assess the geographical vs. methodological influences on the reported frequencies </plain></SENT>
