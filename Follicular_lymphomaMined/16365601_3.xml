<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Idiotype-secreting hybridomas were obtained by fusion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells from 5 patients with FL, and the K6H6/B5 human heteromyeloma and rearranged VH genes from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples and hybridomas were amplified, cloned, and sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequences were aligned with germline genes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo>, intraclonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> and genealogic relations of the B-cell clones in the different biopsy specimens were determined </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further diversification resulted in the presence of 2 to 6 subclones in 4 of the 5 samples studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only in 1 patient did the hypermutation mechanism introduce differences among most of the potential idiotopes present in individual subclones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The VH sequence of the hybridoma that provided the idiotypic-vaccine was identified in one of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> subclones in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No relapse has been demonstrated in 3 of the 4 vaccinated patients (follow-up: 29-103 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that despite potential differences in the idiotypic region expressed by individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, at least some potential idiotopes may be preserved among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> subclones in most cases studied </plain></SENT>
