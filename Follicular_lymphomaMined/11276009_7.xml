<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by at least a partial follicular growth pattern in the majority of cases, by the morphological resemblance of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells to follicle centre centroblasts and centrocytes, and by the distinctive expression of Bcl-2 protein as a consequence of a translocation between chromosomes 14 and 18, resulting in the juxtaposition of Bcl-2 and the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is not known whether the follicular growth pattern of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is a consequence of properties of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells, or whether the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells invade and gradually occupy a niche generated by a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T-cell-dependent B-cell response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study has identified cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in which the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells are apparent within a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> reactive germinal centre background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reactive background has been investigated in these cases and also in cases showing a more characteristic appearance, in which entire malignant follicles appear to be Bcl-2-positive, as assessed by microdissection and analysis of clonality by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A reactive oligoclonal background was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases studied, characteristic of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> follicle centre response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the progression of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is dependent on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> germinal centre microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disruption of this dependence might be considered as a novel therapeutic strategy </plain></SENT>
