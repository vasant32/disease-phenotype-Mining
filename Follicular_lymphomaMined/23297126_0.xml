<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies that can reveal oncogenic pathways have stimulated interest in tailoring therapies toward actionable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, for mutation-directed therapies to be most effective, the mutations must be uniformly present in evolved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells as well as in the self-renewing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-cell precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we show striking intratumoral clonal diversity within FL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in the representation of mutations in the majority of genes as revealed by whole exome sequencing of subpopulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This diversity captures a clonal hierarchy, resolved using immunoglobulin <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> and IGH-BCL2 translocations as a frame of reference and by comparing diagnosis and relapse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> pairs, allowing us to distinguish early versus late genetic eventsduring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We provide evidence that IGH-BCL2 translocations and CREBBP mutations are early events, whereas MLL2 and TNFRSF14 mutations probably represent late events during disease evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations provide insight into which of the genetic lesions represent suitable candidates for targeted therapies </plain></SENT>
