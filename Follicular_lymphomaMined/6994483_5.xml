<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had significantly (P less than 0.05) higher levels of IgG and IgA than patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, polyclonal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020455" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperimmunoglobulinemia</z:e> was overall more common than hypoimmunoglobulinemia, and abnormally high immunoglobulin levels were most frequently found in patients who had diffuse histologic patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The highest values were associated with either <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> composed of T (thymus-derived) cells or large B (bursa-derived) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of quantitative <z:hpo ids='HP_0010701'>immunoglobulin abnormalities</z:hpo> in patients with T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was comparable with that in patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities in the former group of patients were exclusively above the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, whereas they were equally above and below the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in the latter group </plain></SENT>
