<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> can be induced in HF1A3 cells by B cell receptor (BCR) stimulation, but the molecular mechanisms and kinetics of this process are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate here that there is over 12 h delay between receptor activation and the execution phase of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, i.e. disruption of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential, release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> from mitochondria, caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>New protein synthesis is required for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> alterations and subsequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> to occur, as these processes are completely blocked by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48001">protein synthesis inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the apoptotic events induced by BCR triggering are completely reversed by CD40 ligation with anti-CD40 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD40 ligation can reverse the apoptotic process in HF1A3 cells almost until the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> events take place demonstrating that CD40-mediated protection operates very fast and at or before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> phase of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using specific inhibitors of cell signaling we could demonstrate that Raf-extracellular signal-regulated kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, p38 or protein kinase C activation pathways are not involved in CD40-mediated protection from BCR-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in HF1A3 cells </plain></SENT>
