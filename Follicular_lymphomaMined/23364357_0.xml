<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of follicular origin with extreme signet ring cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initially classified as follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> on a fine needle core biopsy, the presence of cohesive sheets of extrafollicular signet ring cells triggered an excisional biopsy for further characterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The excised lymph node revealed focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> composed of vague nodules and sheets of large atypical cells, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which virtually exhibited large clear intracytoplasmic vacuoles with peripheral displacement of nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were negative for mucin and lacked immunoreactivity with pancytokeratin, but were strongly immunoreactive with CD20, BCL-2, BCL-6, and CD10 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy studies revealed electron-lucent vacuoles with no particular internal structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This case is unique in that extreme signet ring cell differentiation somewhat obscured the true cytological identity of the interfollicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and suggested alternative diagnoses </plain></SENT>
