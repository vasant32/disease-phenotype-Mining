<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported an overexpression of Smad1 in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) cells, which are characterized by the t(14;18) bcl2/IgH translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Smad1 is commonly involved in bone morphogenetic protein but not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study focuses on Smad1 signaling pathway in non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells including follicular or large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results support the notion that phosphorylation of Smad1 is mediated by TGFbeta present in the microenvironment and occurs in FL in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using an in vitro coculture system mimicking interactions between stroma cells and FL cells, we found that both the cell partners release TGFbeta at a sufficient concentration to activate Smad pathways in the malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This Smad1 activation involves TGFbetaRII but not ALK-1 receptors, and does not compete with the Smad2 pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, proliferation assays performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells expressing <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> or mutated Smad1, or in which endogenous Smad1 level was decreased by gene silencing, strongly supported that overexpression and activation of Smad1 modifies the biological response of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B cells to TGFbeta family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This work opens new insights into aberrant Smad pathways and their pathophysiological role in FL and in other non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
