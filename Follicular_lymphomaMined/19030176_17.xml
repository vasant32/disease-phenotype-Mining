<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The significance of low level circulating t(14;18)-positive cells in healthy individuals as clonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> precursors or indicators of risk is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined the age dependent prevalence and frequency of BCL2/IgH rearrangements in 715 healthy individuals ranging from newborns to octo- and nonagenarians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results were compared with number of circulating t(14;18)-positive cells in 108 FL patients at initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall prevalence of BCL2/IgH junctions in this large sample was 46% (327/715) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there was a striking dependence upon age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specifically, among individuals up to 10 years old, none had detectable circulating t(14;18)-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the age groups representing 10-50 years old, we found a steady elevation in the prevalence of BCL2/IgH junctions up to a prevalence of 66% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further increases of the prevalence in individuals older than 50 years were not seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean frequency of BCL2/IgH junctions in healthy individuals &gt; or =40 years (18-26 x 10(-6)) was significantly higher than in younger subjects (7-9 x 10(-6)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four percent (31/715) of individuals carried more than one t(14;18)-positive cell per 25,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In comparison, 108 stage III/IV FL patients had a median number of circulating t(14;18)-positive malignant FL cells of about 9200/1 million PBMNCs (range 7-1,000,000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings will further improve the understanding of the relevance of t(14;18)-positive cells in healthy individuals as a risk marker toward the development into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> precursors </plain></SENT>
