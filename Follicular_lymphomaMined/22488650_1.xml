<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, their role remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to define the treatment effect of intensified therapy followed by ASCT compared with conventional therapy as first-line treatment of patients with FL in terms of overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We searched for randomised controlled trials in Medline, Embase, the Cochrane controlled trials register and the Science Citation Index (1985 to June 2011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Effect measures used were hazard ratios (HR) for OS, EFS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">secondary tumour</z:e> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two independent review authors extracted data and assessed quality of trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four trials were identified, covering a total of 941 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The random-effects summary HR by comparing the treatment effect on OS between intensified and conventional therapy was 0.95 [0.70, 1.30] (p = 0.75), indicating that no additional survival benefit was derived from the intensified therapy followed by ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant benefit of intensified therapy followed by ASCT as first-line treatment was detected in terms of EFS: the random-effects summary HR (intensified versus conventional therapy) was 0.59 [0.44, 0.79] (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This meta-analysis showed that despite its superior EFS, intensified therapy followed by ASCT does not improve the OS compared with conventional therapy </plain></SENT>
