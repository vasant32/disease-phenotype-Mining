<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The early experience is reported here of the use of intra-operative frozen-section service by telepathology using the integrated Service Digital Network (ISDN), a commercially available system that is being connected between the Department of Pathology of Tottori University and Matsue City Hospital, a distance of 30 km </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The transfer rate is currently 64 kbit/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frozen-section service was conducted for a total of 117 tissue specimens (organs) from 100 patients between August 1993 and May 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average time taken for examination of each specimen of frozen section was 13 min, ranging between 2 and 42 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average number of transmitted images was 6.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six cases necessitated more than 11 transmitted images to make a diagnosis, while 13 cases could be diagnosed from two images only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correct and permissible diagnoses were obtained in 109 (93.2%) out of 117 specimens when comparing the telepathology diagnosis with that of direct microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Improper or misdiagnosis was made for eight cases (specimens), which were misinterpreted as papillary <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Basedow's disease</z:e>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> in two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytomas</z:hpo>, solid-tubular <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010701" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">phyllodes tumor</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006145" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mastopathy</z:e> in invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, metastatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0009592'>astrocytoma</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in reactive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002840'>lymphadenitis</z:hpo> in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In retrospect, diagnosis of these cases should have been deferred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From the results, it was concluded that the intraoperative frozen-section service by telepathology may be a worthwhile substitute for hospitals with limited accessibility to local pathology service, in spite of pitfalls in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Well prepared, high-quality frozen section, sufficient verbal communication with surgeons, and a rather conservative attitude on the part of a well-trained pathologist seem to be the essential ingredients for reaching an accurate decision when using telepathology </plain></SENT>
