<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The biological and clinical significance of these breakpoints is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2 breakpoint site was determined in 247 previously untreated patients (49% men; median age 52 years) with indolent FL (155 grade I, 83 grade II, and 8 grade III) to correlate it with pretreatment characteristics, response, and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2 breakpoint site was determined by a polymerase chain reaction method of peripheral blood (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases), bone marrows (149 cases), and fresh lymph node biopsy specimens (68 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint site occurred at MBR in 175 cases (71%) and at mcr in 27 (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 45 cases (18%), no breakpoint was detected (germline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant relationship was found between the rearrangements and the expression of BLC-2 and BAX proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients' germline for MBR and mcr tended to present more frequently with stage IV disease and higher beta2-microglobulin (beta2M) levels, whereas mcr-rearranged patients presented more frequently with early stage and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> beta2M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The complete response rate of germline patients was significantly lower than that of MBR and mcr patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An estimated 3-year failure-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e>) for mcr, MBR, and germline cases was 95%, 76%, and 57%, respectively (P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2 breakpoint site was independent of serum beta2M and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase in its correlation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the bcl-2 rearrangement site is an important prognostic factor in indolent FL, useful to identify patients who may require different treatment </plain></SENT>
