<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Efficacy results from the large phase 3, randomized Primary Rituximab and Maintenance (PRIMA) trial in the first-line setting have dem onstrated significant improvements in progression-free survival, in the rate of patients achieving complete remission, and in the proportion of patients remaining in complete remission using maintenance rituximab.The use of maintenance therapy is also under study in additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e>, including diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
