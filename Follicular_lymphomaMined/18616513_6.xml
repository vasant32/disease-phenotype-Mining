<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) has also been found to correlate with poor survival in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data concerning the clinical role of protein expression of p53 or gelatinases and their inhibitors in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic and clinical implications of the immunoreactive proteins p53, MMP-2, MMP-9, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and TIMP-2 in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The material consisted of 67 patients with primarily non-transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic lymph node tissue sections of patients were stained by immunohistochemical method using specific monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: p53 over-expression was detected in 8 (12%) out of 67 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>p53 over-expression correlated with high grade (P = 0.011), bulky <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> (P = 0.031) and forthcoming transformation (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It also correlated with poor overall (P = 0.001) and cause-specific survival (P = 0.010) in multivariate analysis and had a strong inverse correlation with time to transformation (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MMP-2, MMP-9 and TIMP-2 expression correlated with high grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MMP-9 positivity in centroblasts correlated with good chemotherapy response (P = 0.019), but it was not prognostic for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MMP-2, TIMP-1 or TIMP-2 did not associate with survival, either </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, p53 over-expression predicted both transformation to diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and poorer overall and cause-specific survival of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Expression of gelatinases or their inhibitors did not have any significant correlations with prognosis, although MMP-9 predicted a good response to first-line chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
