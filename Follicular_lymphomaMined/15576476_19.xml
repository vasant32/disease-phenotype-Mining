<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Substantial research has been dedicated to the study of the relationship between genetic mechanisms regulating cell functions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and how those <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> respond to various treatment regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because these mechanisms are still not well understood, we have chosen to study the genetic makeup of 57 tumor samples from patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to develop a prognostic tool, which can be used as an aid in determining FL patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> genetically predisposed to a successful treatment with the CHOP (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>) regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To select relevant genes, high-density oligonucleotide arrays were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 14 genes highly expressed in FL patients that responded well to CHOP chemotherapy, and 11 of these were involved in G2/M transition of the cell cycle, in mitosis, or in DNA modulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A high expression of CCNB1 (cyclin B1), CDC2, CDKN3A, CKS1B, ANP32E, and KIAA0101, but not of the proliferation-related antigen Ki-67, was associated with better survival rate in a univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CCNB1 expression had an independent prognostic value when included in a multivariate analysis together with the 5 parameters of the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> international prognostic index </plain></SENT>
