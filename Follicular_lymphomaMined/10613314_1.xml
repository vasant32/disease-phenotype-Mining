<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Management of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> after chemotherapy failure has been controversial and has ranged from watchful waiting to high-dose chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High-dose chemotherapy with bone marrow reconstitution may produce clinical and molecular complete responses at the risk of serious morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been previously reported that central lymphatic irradiation (CLI) can achieve long-term relapse-free survival in patients with Stage I, II, or III follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the feasibility of treating patients in whom front-line chemotherapy failed with salvage CLI instead of instituting more intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: Salvage CLI with curative intent for patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was started at The University of Texas M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anderson <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center in 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients whose disease showed poor response to or relapsed after chemotherapy were managed with this approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median age of the patients was 61 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Criteria for exclusion included bone marrow involvement or other evidence of Ann Arbor Stage IV disease at any time during the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall survival and relapse-free survival were calculated from the first day of CLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten patients were alive at a median follow-up of 25 months (range 9-73 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The treatment was well tolerated in general </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two patients could not complete CLI: one 75-year-old patient owing to prolonged platelet count <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and deterioration in general medical condition, and a 66-year-old patient because of exacerbation of preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and worsening of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Everyone who completed CLI remains in remission at the time of this report, except for one patient who had a relapse in the right lacrimal gland at 32 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This patient was treated with local radiation therapy and is free of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Eventual recovery of the blood counts was observed for the patients who completed CLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate for the first time that with CLI, it is possible to achieve complete remission of acceptable quality in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients who experience a chemotherapy failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The main toxicity is limited to transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in hematological profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The treatment is fairly well tolerated and seems to carry little risk compared with high-dose chemotherapy and bone marrow rescue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Salvage CLI may not necessarily compromise future treatment with chemotherapy, including autologous bone marrow or stem cell transplantation, because the patients' blood counts recover </plain></SENT>
