<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The introduction of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab, into the treatment of patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> has improved the overall response rate, as well as the response duration and the overall survival of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, only a few studies have addressed the question of whether higher CD20 expression parallels with better treatment outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the level of CD20 expression and overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) along with the overall response rate (ORR) in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ultimate objective of the study was to determine the cut-off value of CD20 expression together with the predictive significance of better outcome of rituximab treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred and fourteen patients with different histological types of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> treated with rituximab and chemotherapy between 2003 and 2007 were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had CD20 expression assessed prior to the beginning of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The level of CD20 expression was determined by quantitative flow cytometric measurements, while the OS and DFS were evaluated by means of Kaplan-Meier survival curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cut-off value of CD20 expression, which predicts a better response to rituximab in patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, was determined at 25.000 molecules of equivalent soluble <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51217">fluorochrome</z:chebi> (MESF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data show that patients who achieved complete response after rituximab therapy had a significantly higher expression of the CD20 antigen (p=0.018) than those whose disease only stabilized after rituximab therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed in the response duration between the patients with CD20 antigen expressed above the cut-off value and those expressing CD20 antigen below the cut-off value [hazard ratio (HR), 0.5667; 95%CI, 0.124 to 3.18, p=0.57] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Even though we have proved that patients with a CD20 expression level above the cut-off value treated with rituximab had a significantly longer OS [hazard ratio (HR), 0.4573; 95%CI, 0.1364 to 0.9461, p=0.0383] than patients with a CD20 expression level below the cut-off value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among our study population, 17.5% had a CD20 expression level below the cut-off value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The highest percentage (80%) of the patients with a CD20 expression level below the cut-off value belonged to the group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) patients, while the lowest (6.7%) was observed in the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that a higher level of CD20 expression correlates with an improved OS in patients treated with rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The cut-off limit of CD20 expression suggested to have the predictive significance of better outcome was in our series set at 25.000 MESF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This cut-off value should be considered when the decision regarding treatment with rituximab is taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, these results warrant further studies on larger groups of patients </plain></SENT>
