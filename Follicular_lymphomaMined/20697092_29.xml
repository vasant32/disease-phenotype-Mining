<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We report the long-term results of a randomized clinical trial comparing induction therapy with once per week for 4 weeks single-agent rituximab alone versus induction followed by 4 cycles of maintenance therapy every 2 months in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (prior chemotherapy 138; chemotherapy-naive 64) received single-agent rituximab and if <z:hpo ids='HP_0003680'>nonprogressive</z:hpo>, were randomly assigned to no further treatment (observation) or four additional doses of rituximab given at 2-month intervals (prolonged exposure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 9.5 years and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> living patients having been observed for at least 5 years, the median event-free survival (EFS) was 13 months for the observation and 24 months for the prolonged exposure arm (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the observation arm, patients without events at 8 years were 5%, while in the prolonged exposure arm they were 27% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of previously untreated patients receiving prolonged treatment after responding to rituximab induction, at 8 years 45% were still without event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The only favorable prognostic factor for EFS in a multivariate Cox regression was the prolonged rituximab schedule (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.88; P = .009), whereas being chemotherapy naive, presenting with stage lower than IV, and showing a VV phenotype at position 158 of the Fc-gamma RIIIA receptor were not of independent prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No long-term toxicity potentially due to rituximab was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An important proportion of patients experienced long-term remission after prolonged exposure to rituximab, particularly if they had no prior treatment and responded to rituximab induction </plain></SENT>
