<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both the insertion breakpoint at 14q32 and the deletion breakpoint at 18q21 were cloned using inverse polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis showed that the JH sequences were juxtaposed to the 5'-side of BCL2, and the DH sequences were juxtaposed to the 3'-side of BCL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were breakpoints at both the JH and DH recombination signal sequences, and N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> were present at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> breakpoint junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the BCL2 locus, the 3'-breakpoints in both cases were localized at exactly the same nucleotide position, 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2 kilobase downstream of the major breakpoint region, directly adjacent to a complete cryptic recombination signal sequence (RSS) consisting of a heptamer, a nonamer, and a 23-base pair (bp) spacer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The BCL2 5'-breakpoints were approximately 600 bp upstream of the gene, within the CA repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although less evident than for the BCL2 3'-breakpoints, cryptic RSSs were also identified at these breakpoints, with a 12-bp spacer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the basis of structural characteristics of these rearrangements, a model is proposed in which the BCL2 gene is deleted from its locus by recombination activation gene-1/-2 (RAG-1/-2)-mediated excision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The gene is subsequently inserted into the recombining IGH locus, a process involving the formation of hybrid joints between the IGH coding ends and the BCL2 signal ends </plain></SENT>
