<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The role of allogeneic transplantation with reduced-intensity conditioning in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) is currently unclear, with relatively little published data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the outcome of reduced-intensity transplantation (RIT) in a cohort of 48 consecutive patients with relapsed/refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (30 patients with de novo disease and 18 patients with transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) who underwent transplantation with an alemtuzumab-containing regimen, with a median follow-up of 52 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients had experienced treatment failure with a median of five lines of prior therapy, including autologous transplantation in 69%, and 17% of patients were chemotherapy refractory at transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median age was 46 years, and 38% of patients had matched/mismatched unrelated donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conditioning was with alemtuzumab, fludarabine, and melphalan, and additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis was with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were successfully engrafted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 17% of patients developed grade 2 to 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, with 13% experiencing extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four-year estimated nonrelapse mortality was 32%, and relapse risk was 33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients received donor lymphocyte infusions +/- chemoimmunotherapy for relapse, and five patients obtained durable remissions, giving current progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates at 4 years of 48% and 47%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients who had chemotherapy-sensitive disease before RIT had current PFS and OS rates at 4 years of 55% and 54%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy-refractory patients had a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The encouraging survival rates with extended follow-up suggest a role for RIT in chemotherapy-sensitive relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, even in patients who have previously experienced treatment failure with autologous transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Future studies will be required to determine whether any subset of patients with relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> should be considered for RIT versus autologous transplantation </plain></SENT>
