<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two patients with stages II to IV indolent non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (follicular or small lymphocytic) who had received no previous systemic therapy entered this multicenter, community-based trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received rituximab 375 mg/m(2) weekly for 4 consecutive weeks, and were evaluated for response at week 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who had an objective response or stable disease continued treatment every 6 months with repeat 4-week courses of rituximab for a total of four treatment courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interim results of this ongoing trial are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When evaluated at week 6, 28 of 60 evaluable patients (47%) had objective response and 27 patients (45%) had minor response or stable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With further follow-up and repeat courses of rituximab, the major response rate increased from 47% to 65% and the complete response rate increased from 7% to 27% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Response rates were similar in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (63% and 66%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival has not been reached, but will be greater than 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There has been no cumulative toxicity observed with repeat courses of rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rituximab is highly effective as a first-line single agent for the treatment of indolent non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The initial response rate can be improved by using scheduled maintenance courses of rituximab administered every 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Final information regarding duration of response and time to progression awaits further follow-up </plain></SENT>
