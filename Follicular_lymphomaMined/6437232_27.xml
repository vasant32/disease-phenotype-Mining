<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The relationship between follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of small-cleaved-cell type was investigated with the use of a panel of antibodies against B-cell differentiation antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, regardless of histologic subtype, were immunologically homogeneous: Ig+ B1+ B2+ CALLA+ Ia+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two cases were Ig-negative, and 4 were CALLA-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffuse small-cleaved-cell (centrocytic) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority were Ig+ B1+ B2+ Ia+ T1+ CALLA- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A minority were B2-negative, T1-negative, or CALLA-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An increased frequency of Ig heavy chain class switching and loss of T1 antigen suggest that follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are at a later stage of differentiation than most centrocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The differences in immunologic phenotype provide further justification for a classification that distinguishes between follicular and diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of small-cleaved-cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of Ig, Ia, B1, and B2 on neoplastic follicular center cells correlates with expression of these antigens on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, anti-B2 appears to stain a nonlymphoid dendritic cell present in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> germinal centers and in both follicular and diffuse germinal center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the dendritic pattern was similar to that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> follicles, while in centrocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> a more irregular dendritic pattern was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Dendritic staining was seen in both nodal and extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, suggesting that these nonlymphoid cells either migrate with neoplastic B cells or are present in a variety of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
