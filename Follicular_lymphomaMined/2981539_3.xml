<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that Natural Killer (NK) cell activity is involved in host defence against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, and that NK cells react with or recognize the transferrin receptor (TrR) on target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HNK-1 expression has been related to NK cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in 118 cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) we studied the occurrence and distribution of HNK-1+ cells by immunohistochemistry, and simultaneously assessed the expression of TrR on malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In NHL of intermediate or high grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> there was uniform expression of TrR on malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In low grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> NHL, only lymphocytic and lymphoplasmacytoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were TrR negative, except for faint staining of proliferation centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 23 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 9 showed the absence of HNK-1+ cells in neoplastic follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 16/23 cases HNK-1+ cells were present around follicles or in interfollicular areas: 8 of these cases revealed a higher density of HNK-1+ cells at this site than inside the follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 22/26 cases with high grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> NHL, HNK-1+ cells were absent or present in small density, which is different from the presence in higher density in low grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that (i) TrR expression on NHL cells is not obligatory related with histological class or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> grade of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>, and that (ii) HNK-1+ cells are not universally present in areas of malignant cells, in particular in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in NHL of high grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
