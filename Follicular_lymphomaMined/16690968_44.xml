<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it was based on different protocols, none of which included rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current analysis aimed at evaluating the predictive value of the FLIPI for treatment outcome in 362 patients with advanced-stage FL treated front-line with rituximab/CHOP in a prospective trial of the German Low Grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Study Group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to the FLIPI, 14% of the patients were classified as low-risk, 41% as intermediate-risk, and 45% as high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With a 2-year time to treatment failure (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi>) of 67%, high-risk patients had a significantly shorter <z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi> as compared with low- or intermediate-risk patients (2-year <z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi> of 92% and 90%, respectively; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that the FLIPI is able to identify high-risk patients with advanced-stage FL after first-line treatment with rituximab/chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
