<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In most cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, t(14;18) chromosomal translocation can be detected in lymphocytes of peripheral blood and bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, certain other types of diseases can also be characterised by the presence of the translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjogren's syndrome</z:e> have an increased frequency of developing non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, e.g. follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; in turn, they may have translocation-bearing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjögren's syndrome</z:e> patients were screened using a nested polymerase chain reaction technique to identify whether they had the translocation in their peripheral blood lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five percent of that population revealed a temporary or long-lasting presence of the translocation, sometimes even in the lymphocytes from bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that in addition to the conventional diagnostic methods of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, there are certain other factors, e.g. the duration of the presence of t(14; 18) translocation and the source of lymphocytes, that should be considered for successful early diagnoses and perhaps for treatment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjögren</z:e>'s patients </plain></SENT>
