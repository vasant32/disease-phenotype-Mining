<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The meeting was under the auspices of the European <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Institute, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Study Association (LYSA) and Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (FIL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine scientific posters were presented or discussed in the plenary session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A group of nuclear medicine and radiology experts presented and discussed with the audience their final report on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> staging and restaging with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same report will be presented in a dedicated workshop during the 12th International Conference on Malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (ICML) in Lugano </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mainly, it was proposed to use the same type of criteria (Deauville five-point scale) for interim and end of treatment PET reporting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results were presented on the state of the art of the role of PET in staging and response assessment in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, primary mediastinal large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (PMBCL), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although PET is now recognized as a useful tool in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, prospective data should be acquired on a larger scale to better define its role in the other subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Technical and clinical focus was given to the measurement of metabolic volume to evaluate the total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden, and interim PET-based ongoing trials were presented for LYSA and FIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Final results of international validation studies of Deauville criteria and change in maximum standardized uptake value (Î”SUVmax) analysis were presented for Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A closed meeting was held addressing the issue of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) in the PET/CT era </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The next meeting (September 2014) will be open to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> imaging modalities used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> investigation </plain></SENT>
