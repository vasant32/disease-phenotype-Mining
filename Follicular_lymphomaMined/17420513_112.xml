<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Rituximab has been shown to be active in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a randomized trial comparing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>) chemotherapy plus rituximab with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Previously untreated patients with stage III or IV CD20+ indolent or mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were randomly assigned to either eight 28-day cycles of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> plus rituximab (R-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>; n = 181) or eight cycles of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> alone (n = 177) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who achieved a complete or partial remission were treated with interferon maintenance until relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Herein, we report the results from the primary analysis population of patients with FL, who constituted the majority of patients (56%) recruited to the trial (n = 201; R-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>, n = 105; <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>, n = 96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rates of overall and complete response were significantly higher in the R-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> arm than the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> arm (overall response, 92% v 75%, respectively; P = .0009; complete response, 50% v 25%, respectively; P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up time of 47 months, median event-free survival (EFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) times were significantly prolonged with R-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> compared with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> (EFS, not reached v 26 months, respectively; P &lt; .0001; PFS, not reached v 28.8 months, respectively; P &lt; .0001), and overall survival (OS) was significantly improved with R-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> compared with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> (4-year OS rate, 87% v 74%, respectively; P = .0096) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The R-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> regimen significantly improves complete and overall response rates, EFS, PFS, and OS in patients with previously untreated advanced FL, without a clinically significant increase in toxicity </plain></SENT>
