<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have determined that the bcl-2 (B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 2) gene is transcribed into three overlapping <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi>, and we have cloned bcl-2 cDNA sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the bcl-2 cDNA clones and comparison of their sequences to their genomic counterparts indicate that the bcl-2 gene contains at least two exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The three bcl-2 transcripts, which are 8.5, 5.5, and 3.5 kilobases (kb) long, overlap within the first exon, but only the 8.5-kb and 5.5-kb transcripts contain sequences of the second exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 8.5-kb and 5.5-kb transcripts seem to use different polyadenylylation sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the cDNA clones corresponding to the 5.5-kb and 3.5-kb <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> indicates that the two bcl-2 transcripts carry two overlapping open reading frames, one of which is 717 nucleotides long and codes for a protein (bcl-2 alpha) of 239 amino acids and a molecular mass of 26 kDa, while the other codes for a protein of 205 amino acids (bcl-2 beta, molecular mass 22 kDa) that is identical to bcl-2 alpha except at the carboxyl terminus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2 protein products in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with or without bcl-2 rearrangements are identical to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bcl-2 products </plain></SENT>
