<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>bcl-2, an inhibitor of programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>), is present in high levels in a subset of prostatic <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, 42 prostatic <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were analyzed to determine whether increased bcl-2 levels are associated with rearrangements in the 2.8-kb major breakpoint region, an association known to occur in certain follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> featuring a t(14:18) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining for bcl-2 and p53 proteins was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specimens using murine anti-human bcl-2 and p53 monoclonal antibodies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 42 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA from paired frozen samples of each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was subjected to digestion with HindIII and EcoRI and the products analyzed on a Southern blot with a 2.8-kb-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="42098">digoxigenin</z:chebi>-labeled major breakpoint region probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparisons between groups were evaluated with the Fisher exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diffuse, strong cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for bcl-2 was present in the epithelial cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> glands in 16 of 42 cases (38%), including 8 of 19 low grade (Gleason score 6 and below) and 8 of 23 high grade (Gleason score 7 and above) prostatic <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Southern blotting demonstrated a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 2.8-kb germline DNA fragment in every case, with no evidence of rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nuclear p53 staining was present in 10 of 24 high grade and 0 of 18 low grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only four cases exhibited positivity for both bcl-2 and p53, and there was no association of bcl-2 positivity with co-expression of the p53 protein (P = 0.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that aberrations in the function of either bcl-2 or p53 could possibly modify the apoptotic pathway resulting in the extended survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Also, increased bcl-2 levels in prostatic <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> occur in the absence of detectable rearrangements in the major breakpoint region </plain></SENT>
