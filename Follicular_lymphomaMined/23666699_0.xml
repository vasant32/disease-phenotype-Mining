<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This translocation juxtaposes the BCL2 oncogene at 18q21 with the IGH@ at 14q32, and leads to overexpression of BCL2 protein which protects the cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The high degree of sequence homology among the 3' portion of the JH segments and the clustering of breakpoints on chromosome 18 make the IGH@/BCL2 very amenable to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe two multiplex TaqMan-based real-time PCR assays which can be used to detect and quantify the major and minor breatpoint cluster regions of IGH@/BCL2 fusion products in newly diagnosed FL, and to monitor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> during treatment or early relapse </plain></SENT>
