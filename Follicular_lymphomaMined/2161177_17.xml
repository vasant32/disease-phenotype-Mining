<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors report two extremely unusual cases in which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic cancer</z:e> was mimicked by mesothelial cell inclusions in mediastinal lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cells appeared only in the nodal sinuses and occurred predominantly as single individual cells and small clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The nuclei were bland, the N/C ratio was low, and the cell borders were well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>So-called mesothelial windows were noted when cells formed groups; mitoses were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the inclusions to be positive for cytokeratin (both AE1/3 and CAM5.2) but negative for epithelial membrane antigen, Leu-M1, and carcinoembryonic antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cells were negative for B72.3; rare cells in one case contained unusual minute granular dot-like positivity in the region of the Golgi for this marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pattern of cytokeratin immunoreactivity was consistent with a mesothelial cell: namely, stronger immunoreactivity in a perinuclear location with some fading at the cell periphery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural analysis of both cases documented long microvilli processes consistent with a mesothelial origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An extensive clinical workup in each case has failed to identify a primary <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is interesting that both patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002102'>pleuritis</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo> and both had mediastinal widening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the first case, the exact cause of the benign pleural process was unknown but thought to be infectious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The second patient had follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the same lymph node together with pleural involvement clinically and evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The patients are alive three years and ten months from diagnosis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Recognition of this new and previously unrecognized entity is important to prevent a diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in such rare instances </plain></SENT>
