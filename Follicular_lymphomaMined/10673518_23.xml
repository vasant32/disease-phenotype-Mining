<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From September 1995 to July 1998, 199 patients aged 25 to 65 years (median, 54 years) with newly diagnosed stages II to IV indolent or mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (standard risk according to the International Prognostic Index) were enrolled onto a multicenter, 1:1 randomized study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 199 patients who were able to be assessed, 101 were assigned to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e> group (six monthly cycles of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e> 25 mg/m(2)/d on days 1 through 5) and 98 to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e>-ID group (six monthly cycles of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e> 25 mg/m(2)/d on days 1 through 3 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> 12 mg/m(2) on day 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e> group, complete response (CR) and partial response rates were 47% and 37%, respectively, whereas in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e>-ID group, they were 39% and 42%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In-depth analysis of the CR rate with respect to histologic type showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e> seemed to be superior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e>-ID in treating follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (60% v 40%, respectively), whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e>-ID seemed to be more effective than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e> in treating nonfollicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (small lymphocytic, 43% v 29%, respectively; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytoma</z:e>, 38% v 23%, respectively; P = not significant), excluding the mantle-cell subset (in which there was no difference between the two groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No striking differences were observed between the two protocols in terms of overall response or toxicity, which was generally mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, with a median follow-up of 19 months, only 29 patients (62%) who received <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e> alone have maintained their initial CR, compared with 32 (84%) of those who received <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e>-ID therapy (P =.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e>-ID regimen may not significantly improve the induction of CR in most indolent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, our preliminary data do suggest that, with respect to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e> alone, it may be capable of conferring a longer-lasting CR and that it might be superior in terms of CR rate in small lymphocytic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytoma</z:e> subtypes </plain></SENT>
