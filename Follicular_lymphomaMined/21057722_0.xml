<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Aim: Although predictive factors (PF) for conventional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> therapy are established and frequently used in clinical practice and medical research, the PF for radioimmunotherapy (RIT) have not been fully defined until now </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this multicenter evaluation is to prove the feasibility of the multicenter web-based data collection and to preliminary explore imaging findings and prediction of therapy response in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) following radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients, methods: We retrospectively analyzed and correlated clinical and imaging data (CT and FDG-PET) before and after RIT as documented by the RIT-Network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of treatment response was done on both patient and lesion basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Every measurable lesion was analyzed in terms of standardized uptake value (SUV), volume (CT and PET) and response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PF were identified using a uni- and multivariate model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A web-based system was used for the documentation and evaluation of clinical and imaging data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results: 16 patients with at least one PET before and after RIT were eligible for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concerning response three months postRIT, 5 patients achieved a CR, 6 patients a PR and 4 patients remained with NC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 159 lesions were measured (mean 10Â±8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate model the log lesion volume (p &lt; 0.0001), the total (p = 0.03) and maximum lesion volume (p = 0.05) were predictors for response (CR + PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Concerning the lesional CR initial small lesion volume (p = 0.009) and its high metabolic activity (p = 0.01) were identified as predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The web-based system showed no major disturbances allowing secure data transfer and central image interpretation in a reasonable time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: The use of a web-based multicenter archiving system for clinical and imaging data is technically feasible in a multicenter setting and allows a central analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This preliminary analysis suggests that FDG-PET may predict the likelihood of response to RIT </plain></SENT>
