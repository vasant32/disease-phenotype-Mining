<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> has been associated with adverse outcome or more aggressive clinical behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This correlation has been established in groups of patients with a large <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> regarding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes and treatment regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate the significance of vascularization in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> receiving uniform first-line treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We assessed microvessel density (MVD) in pretreatment lymph node biopsies of 46 previously untreated patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> using anti-CD34 immunohistochemical staining and interactive quantification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a selection of cases, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in situ hybridization was done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> induction chemotherapy combined with IFN-alpha2b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients responded and received IFN-alpha as maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MVD ranged from 10 to 70 per measurement field of 0.19 mm2 (median, 38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival was 47 months in patients with MVD in the highest tertile and only 13 months in patients with lower MVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall survival in patients with low vessel density was 59 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with high vessel density, median overall survival was not reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis indicated that MVD was independently associated with overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a lack of correlation between VEGF-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> expression and vessel density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study shows that in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> increased vascularization is associated with improved clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, VEGF-A expression seems not to be involved in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
