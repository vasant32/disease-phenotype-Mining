<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS:   Multidrug resistance (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>) in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> still constitutes a major obstacle to the effectiveness of chemotherapy even in the anti-CD20 antibody therapy era </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-associated molecules in reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> (RL), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS:   The expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for ABC-transporter family genes was determined by real-time RT-PCR in lymph nodes from RL, FL, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MDR1 exhibited significantly stronger expression in RL, FL, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> than Raji B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RL and FL showed significantly higher expression than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, MDR1 positive cells were localized in the germinal centers of RL and center of the nodular lesions of FL showing associations with CD21 positive follicular dendritic cells (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Raji cells were co-cultured with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>-derived cells and the expression of MDR1 and drug resistance were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The co-culture of Raji cells with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> induced strong expression of MDR1 and introduced resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:   These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> induce MDR1 expression in reactive as well as neoplastic B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of the interaction of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> with B-cells may provide a novel strategy for treating the chemotherapy resistant fraction </plain></SENT>
