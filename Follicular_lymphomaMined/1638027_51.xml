<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The events that drive the transformation process are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Deregulation of the MYC gene has been implicated in a small number of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This observation led us to examine the molecular organization of the MYC oncogene in 38 cases of histologically transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that arose from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and in 18 of the initial pretransformation follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we examined 58 "control" low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that had not yet shown evidence of histologic progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain gene rearrangements were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> biopsies and rearrangements of the BCL-2 locus were seen in 36 of 38 of the transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (consistent with their origin from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>), in 18 of 18 of the pretransformation follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and in 51 of 58 of the control follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 18 pretransformation follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> specimens displayed at least one immunoglobulin gene and BCL-2 rearrangement in common with the corresponding histologically progressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, indicating a clonal relationship between the original follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the histologically transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MYC rearrangements were detected in 3 of 38 (8%) transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and in 1 of 58 (2%) control follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The latter MYC rearranged follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was clinically aggressive and transformed to a high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that led to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of the patient within 20 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the 18 pretransformation follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed MYC rearrangement, including two from patients who later demonstrated MYC rearrangement in the progressed aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PvuII mutational analysis failed to identify additional MYC gene abnormalities in the progressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with a fraction of high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and is known to upregulate BCL-2, we looked for a potential role for this agent in our progressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We did not detect <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> sequences in any case indicating that EBV does not play a major role in progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The presence of MYC rearrangements in a small fraction of progressed aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and not in the corresponding antecedent follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, suggests that acquisition of a MYC rearrangement is in some cases associated with the transformation event </plain></SENT>
