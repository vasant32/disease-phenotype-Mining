<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In human beings the prevalence of different non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) subtypes varies according to geographical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to classify canine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in Austria and to compare the results with those of similar studies in other countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-two NHLs were classified according to their <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> (based on the Working Formulation) and their immunophenotype (determined with anti-T-cell and anti-B-cell antibodies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-two (51.2%) were of B-cell subtype, 24 (29.3%) of T-cell subtype, and 16 (19.5%) remained unclassified, because of either negative labelling (9/16) or immunoreaction with both antibodies (7/16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> predominated (99%) over follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, while intermediate grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (61%) outnumbered high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (23.2%) and low grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (13.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common subtype was the diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (40.2%), followed by the large cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (13.4%) and the diffuse small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (13.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follicular large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and small noncleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were uncommon (1.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Generally, these findings accord with those of similar studies in Western Europe, making the existence of specific risk factors in Austria unlikely </plain></SENT>
