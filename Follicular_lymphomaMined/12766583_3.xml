<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> of a post-germinal center (GC) memory B-cell origin, which is negative for Bcl-6 protein expression in low-grade but may become positive in high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because Bcl-6 expression patterns in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of GC and non-GC B-cell origins have recently been characterized and CD10 is generally regarded as a specific marker for GC B cells, we critically evaluated gastric and small intestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> to see whether it is possible to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> of GC B-cell origin by immunostaining in archival specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-grade MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (H-ML) of the stomach (n = 20) was defined by the presence of a concomitant lymphoepithelial lesion and/or follicular colonization; and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> de novo, both gastric (n = 31) and intestinal (n = 21), were defined by the absence of the above features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining for Bcl-6 and CD10 was done using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections and was examined independently by three pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Staining for Bcl-6 was positive (&gt;10% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells) in 55 of 72 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, two distinct patterns were recognized among those positive: diffusely dense (&gt;75%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> (&lt;75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The former was further characterized by a consistency of Bcl-6+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell density at any given area, resembling the staining pattern of the GC or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) (GC/FL pattern), whereas the latter was, besides less dense population, by variable density from area to area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The GC/FL pattern was observed in 36% and 38% of gastric and intestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> de novo, respectively, but in none of the gastric H-ML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD10 was positive in 12 of 71 cases (17%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> coexpressing Bcl-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CD10+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were more frequent in the intestinal (33%) than in gastric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> ( approximately 15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significantly, CD10 expression was observed in three gastric H-MLs, including one that displayed a distinct lymphoepithelial lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion: 1). <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> showing a diffusely dense pattern of Bcl-6 expression should be distinguished from those showing a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> pattern; for the former most likely represents the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> of GC B-cell derivation, and the latter non-GC, including MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; 2). <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> of GC B-cell origin thus defined accounted for about one third of gastric as well as intestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> de novo but none of the gastric H-ML; and 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CD10 expression can be seen in MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and should not be used as the marker for GC B cells </plain></SENT>
