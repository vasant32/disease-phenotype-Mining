<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radiotherapy is the treatment of choice but is frequently associated to local complications </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine consecutive, newly diagnosed OALs patients (eight with a EMZL, one with a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) with a median age of 78 years were treated with this combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight patients were in stage I-A, and one was in stage IV-A; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had low LDH values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (89%) obtained a complete remission and one a partial response </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rituximab in combination with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> proved to be a feasible option as first-line treatment for OALs because of its feasibility and the absence of toxicity and local sequelae </plain></SENT>
