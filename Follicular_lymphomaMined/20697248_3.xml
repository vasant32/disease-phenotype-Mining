<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) can exhibit variant histologic patterns that can lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> with other B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and reactive conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic markers such as CD10 and BCL2 may be difficult to interpret in variant FL patterns, and are often diminished or absent in the interfollicular and diffuse components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 2 recently characterized germinal center B-cell markers, human germinal center associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (HGAL), and LIM-only transcription factor 2 (LMO2), in 127 FL patient biopsies (94 nodal, 33 extranodal), and correlated the findings with histologic pattern, cellular composition, grade, and additional immunostains (CD20, CD3, CD21, CD10, BCL2, and BCL6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Architectural patterns included predominantly follicular (75%) and follicular and diffuse components (25%); 10 cases showed marginal zone differentiation and 3 were floral variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-nine cases were low grade (38 grade 1; 51 grade 2) and 38 were grade 3 (29 grade 3A and 9 grade 3B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HGAL had the highest overall sensitivity of detecting FL and was superior in detecting the interfollicular and diffuse components compared with BCL2, LMO2, CD10, and BCL6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 28 cases that lacked CD10, expressed HGAL, and the majority also expressed LMO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results show that HGAL and LMO2 are sensitive markers for FL diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The addition of HGAL and LMO2 to the immunohistologic panel is beneficial in the work-up of nodal and extranodal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and the efficacy of HGAL in detecting the follicular, interfollicular and diffuse components of FL is of particular value in the setting of variant immunoarchitectural patterns </plain></SENT>
