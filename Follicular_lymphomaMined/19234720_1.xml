<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We therefore tested serum samples of 95 patients with aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> for antibodies against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-associated molecules using SEREX for antibodies against BCL-2, BCL-XL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>-1, survivin, BCL-6, CD20, LM02, PDE4B, cyclin-D2, actinin-alpha1, SCYA3, PKCbeta2, E2IG3, and HGAL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One patient had low-titered (1:100) antibodies against PKCbeta2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antibodies against BCL-2 were detected in the sera of five patients (5.3%), with responses found more frequently in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade 3 (3/26 or 11.5%) than in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (2/67 or 3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-BCL-2 antibodies were of the IgG class and titers ranged from 1:1,000 to 1:100,000 with highest titers before treatment and decreasing slowly during remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The spontaneous immunogenicity of BCL-2 makes this molecule a prime candidate for vaccine approaches in BCL-2 positive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
