<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of their ability to overcome chemotherapy resistance, we conducted a phase II study of Ixabepilone in patients with indolent non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ixabepilone was given at a dose of 25 mg/m(2) weekly for three of four consecutive weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were required to have received &lt; or =4 prior chemotherapy regimens, with an interval of at least one month since the last treatment, 3 months from prior rituximab, and 7 d from prior steroids, an absolute neutrophil count &gt;1 x 10(9)/l and a platelet count &gt;50 x 10(9)/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dose reductions were allowed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate in assessable patients was 27% in this otherwise heavily treated population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient with chemotherapy-refractory follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> attained a complete remission that lasted approximately 8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three responses were also seen in refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> and one in small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The duration of response ranged from 2 to 8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Major toxicities included <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that Ixabepilone has activity in chemotherapy-refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
