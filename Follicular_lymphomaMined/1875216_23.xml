<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The assay used was able to detect one positive cell in approximately 5 x 10(5) cells (a single 14q+ molecule in 2.5 micrograms DNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells positive for t(14;18) were found in six of eight patients initially presenting with stage III or IV disease, compared with zero of seven of those with stage I or II disease (P less than .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two cases 14q+ junction regions were also successfully amplified from formalin-fixed biopsy material obtained at presentation 12 and 17 years previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both, sequence analysis demonstrated that the cells circulating in remission belonged to the original clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that cells bearing t(14;18) frequently persist in the peripheral blood in long remission of advanced follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and question the value of their presence as a predictor of relapse </plain></SENT>
