<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that differences in the frequency of the t(14;18) translocation in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> might explain ethno-geographic variation in the incidence of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested Israeli follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients for the frequency of the t(14;18) translocation, and reviewed the published literature, comparing the frequency in our series with data from different parts of the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tissue specimens from 36 Israeli follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients were tested for presence of the translocation by PCR amplification of the MBR breakpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two of the 36 patients (61%) tested positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A systematic search of the literature yielded 35 papers reporting the frequency of the t(14;18) translocation in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed cytogenetic data and molecular data separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For each method, data were pooled from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies within each of three geographical regions - USA, East Asia and Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pooled data from cytogenetic studies show a low frequency of the translocation in the Far East (38%) compared to the USA (71%), with an intermediate frequency found in Europe (61%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molecular studies show a similar frequency of the translocation in the Far East and Europe, significantly lower than the frequency in pooled data from American studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency in our Israeli series is relatively high, comparable to that detected in the USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the apparent geographical differences we describe are unlikely to be caused by a difference in the biology of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, and are more likely due to technical and methodological factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that it is unlikely that differences in the frequency of the t(14;18) translocation explain the difference in the epidemiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> between East and West </plain></SENT>
