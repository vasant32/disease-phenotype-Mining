<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, lack of standardized PCR protocols resulting in a high level of false negativity has hampered comparability of data in previous clonality studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to address these problems, 22 European laboratories investigated the Ig/TCR rearrangement patterns as well as t(14;18) and t(11;14) translocations of 369 B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> belonging to five WHO-defined entities using the standardized BIOMED-2 multiplex PCR tubes accompanied by international pathology panel review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>B-cell clonality was detected by combined use of the IGH and IGK multiplex PCR assays in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 260 definitive cases of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (n=56), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=54), marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=41) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=109) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of 109 cases of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed no detectable clonal marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The use of these techniques to assign cell lineage should be treated with caution as additional clonal TCR gene rearrangements were frequently detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> disease categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study indicates that the BIOMED-2 multiplex PCR assays provide a powerful strategy for clonality assessment in B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> resulting in high Ig clonality detection rates particularly when IGH and IGK strategies are combined </plain></SENT>
