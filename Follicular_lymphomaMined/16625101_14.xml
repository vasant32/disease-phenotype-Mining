<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The detection rate of the BCL2 rearrangement, representing the characteristic t(14;18)(q32;q21) underlying follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been reported to vary over a wide range (0%-41%), and only a few cases have been studied by molecular cytogenetic techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, 27 primary cutaneous follicle center <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were analyzed by FISH and the results compared with those obtained by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FISH demonstrated translocations affecting the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IGH) in 14 of 27 cases (52%): a t(14;18)(q32;q21) involving BCL2 was found in 11 cases (41%), a t(3;14)(q27;q32) affecting BCL6 in 2 cases (7%), and in 1 case the partner gene of IGH could not be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, PCR did not detect BCL2 rearrangement in any case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the t(14;18)(q32;q21) frequently occurs in primary cutaneous follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reason(s) why BCL2 rearrangements escape the detection by PCR is (are) not clear but could be due to BCL2 mutations, breakpoints outside the amplified DNA, or a high load of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
