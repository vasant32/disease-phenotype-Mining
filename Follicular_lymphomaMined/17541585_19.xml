<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine whether the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> analogue 3'-deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine ([(18)F]FLT) is adequate for early evaluation of the response of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to antiproliferative treatment in a mouse xenotransplant model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunodeficient mice bearing a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> xenotransplant were treated with high-dose chemotherapy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, n = 10), immunotherapy (CD20 mAb, ibritumomab-tiuxetan, n = 10) or radioimmunotherapy ([(90)Y]CD20 mAb, Zevalin, n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight hours after treatment, antiproliferative effects were assessed with [(18)F]FLT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety minutes after i.v. injection of 5-10 MBq [(18)F]FLT, mice were sacrificed and radioactivity within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> organs was measured using a gamma counter and calculated as % ID/g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proliferation fraction in tissue samples derived from treated and untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> was evaluated by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry, which served as the reference for proliferative activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the mean proliferation fraction was 83.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After chemotherapy, the mean proliferation fraction decreased to 39.3% (p = 0.0001), after immunotherapy to 77.6% (p = 0.0078) and after radioimmunotherapy to 78.8% (p = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In none of the animals was a significant change in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> size observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, tumoural [(18)F]FLT uptake was 5.4% ID/g, after chemotherapy it was 1.5% (p = 0.0005), after immunotherapy, 3.9% (non-significant), and after radioimmunotherapy, 5.8% (non-significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> xenotransplant model, [(18)F]FLT detects early antiproliferative drug activity before changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> size are visible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings further support the use of [(18)F]FLT-PET for imaging early response to treatment in malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
