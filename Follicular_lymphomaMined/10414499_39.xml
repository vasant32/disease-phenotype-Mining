<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2 gene on chromosome 18 at q21 and the bcl-6 gene on chromosome 3 at q27 are both highly regulated during B-cell differentiation and show an inverse relationship of expression in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> secondary lymphoid follicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between bcl-2 and bcl-6 protein expression and the relationship between protein expression and the corresponding chromosomal alterations in malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including those associated with the germinal center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of bcl-2 and bcl-6 proteins was studied in 55 cases of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and 21 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), and the results correlated with the presence of t(14;18) and 3q27 abnormalities in a subset of 52 cases with cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These cases were selected to represent a spectrum of nodal and extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including those with and without a t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was shown that the neoplastic cells in 71% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> and 100% of FLs expressed bcl-6 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of bcl-6 was seen more frequently in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with large noncleaved <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> (82% v 27%, P = .0015), but failed to correlate with 3q27 abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight percent of cases with 3q27 abnormalities were bcl-6 protein negative, whereas 85% of cases without a 3q27 abnormalities were bcl-6 protein positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of bcl-2 protein was shown in 51% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> (nodal v extranodal, 71% v 30%, P = .012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>bcl-2 protein was expressed in 89% of FLs with t(14;18), in contrast to 25% of FLs without t(14;18) (P = .016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and FL with t(14;18), the most common pattern of expression was bcl-2+/bcl-6+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> without t(14;18), there was not an inverse relationship between bcl-2 and bcl-6 protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these data suggest that mechanisms other than gene rearrangements can deregulate bcl-2 and bcl-6 expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and there does not appear to be an inverse relationship between these two proteins as seen in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> germinal center </plain></SENT>
