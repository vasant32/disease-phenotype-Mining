<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to distinguish follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) from reactive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> (RH), flow cytometric (FC) immunophenotypic studies have been used primarily to look for monotypic CD5- CD10(+) B cells with much more limited use of bcl-2 stains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied what additional diagnostic information could be extracted from routine FC studies in a retrospective study of 90 FL and 91 RH cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following significant differences were identified: dimmer CD19 on CD10+ B cells in FL (P &lt; .0001), brighter CD10 and more numerous CD10(+) B cells in FL (P &lt; .0001), and brighter CD20 on neoplastic B cells than on other B cells in FL (P = .002) or in RH (P = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the FL cases, no correlations could be documented between any phenotypic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 FL had significantly dimmer CD10 expression than lower grades (P = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visual analysis of CD10(+) vs CD10(-) smaller B cells showed dimmer CD19 on the CD10(+) cells in 28 (44%) of 64 evaluable FL cases and 0 of 87 evaluable RH cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings expand the ways in which FC studies can be used to help diagnose FL and suggest that the phenotypic aberrations identified do not represent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> developmental pathways </plain></SENT>
