<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-five patients were enrolled, and 43 patients, including 34 with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2-CdA was given by continuous intravenous infusion at a dose of 0.09 mg/kg daily for 7 consecutive days, and this schedule was repeated every 4 weeks up to a maximum of 6 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall and complete response rates were 58.1% (25/43; 90% confidence interval, 44.5%-70.9%) and 14.0% (6/43), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The disease progression-free proportions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 43 eligible and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 25 responding patients at 2 years were 30.3% and 48.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nonhematologic toxicities of grade 3 or greater included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, malaise, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> in 1 patient each, an increase in glutamic-pyruvic transaminase level in 2 patients, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
