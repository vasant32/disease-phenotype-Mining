<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few studies have compared BM histologic findings with results of flow cytometric immunophenotyping analysis in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To correlate histologic findings with immunophenotypic data in staging BM biopsy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> specimens of FL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Bone marrow biopsy specimens of untreated FL patients were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histologic findings were correlated with 3-color flow cytometric immunophenotyping results on corresponding BM aspirates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bone marrow biopsy specimens (with or without aspirates) of 114 patients with histologic evidence of FL in BM were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 76 bilateral and 38 unilateral biopsies performed, resulting in 190 specimens: 187 involved by FL and 3 negative (in patients with a positive contralateral specimen) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The extent of BM involvement was &lt; 5% in 32 (17.1%), &gt; or = 5% and &lt; or = 25% in 102 (54.6%), &gt; 25% and &lt; or = 50% in 27 (14.4%), and &gt; 50% in 26 (13.9%) specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pattern of involvement was purely paratrabecular in 81 (43.3%), mixed in 80 (42.8%), and purely nonparatrabecular in 26 (13.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotyping was only performed unilaterally, on BM aspirates of 92 patients, and was positive for a monoclonal B-cell population in 53 (57.6%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotyping was more often negative when biopsy specimens showed FL with a purely paratrabecular pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For comparison, we assessed 163 FL patients without histologic evidence of FL in BM also analyzed by flow cytometric immunophenotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A monoclonal B-cell population was identified in 5 patients (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that 3-color flow cytometric immunophenotyping adds little information to the evaluation of staging BM specimens of FL patients </plain></SENT>
