<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is the most common adult non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis is based on <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and can be confirmed by cytogenetic, flow cytometry (FCM) or molecular studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these complementary approaches, diagnosis sometimes remains difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present work was to characterise the expression of new specific follicular cells markers which allows us to target specifically the abnormal FL cell population in FCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 153 samples from healthy subjects and from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> were analysed by FCM in the same conditions for purpose of comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We showed that CD44 is weakly expressed in FL cells compared with peripheral blood mononuclear cell from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood donors and others cells from B <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We nevertheless observed bone marrow samples where some immature B-cell population express CD44 with lower fluorescence intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we developed a double antibody combination, using CD44 and CD38, which allowed us to separate the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> immature cells from the pathological population using FCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This new phenotypic approach offers an accurate (sensitivity and specificity of 93% and 96%, respectively), fast and low sample consuming method for the diagnosis of FL </plain></SENT>
