<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients (median age 42 years, range: 20-53) with advanced stage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> proceeded to allogeneic BMT a median of 25 (range: 8-154) months postdiagnosis, between 1985 and 2001, and have been followed for a minimum of 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 29 (38%) had refractory disease (n = 5 induction failure, n = 6 resistant relapse) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most (27 of 29, 93%) received total body irradiation-based conditioning; stem cell source was marrow from a related donor (n = 20) or unrelated donor (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of 29 patients (59%) were alive a median of 5 years (range: 2-11) post-BMT with a median Karnofsky Performance Score of 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> occurred because of transplant complications in seven patients (cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality 24%), and progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in five patients (cumulative incidence of refractory/recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-year probability of overall and event-free survival was 58% and 53% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic BMT has resulted in long-term disease-free survival for approximately 50% of this cohort of patients with advanced follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and most of them now enjoy robust health </plain></SENT>
