<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:: Chromosomal translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21) involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGH) and the BCL2 gene (t[14;18][q32;q21]/IGH-BCL2) is present in 60% to 90% of nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To the authors' knowledge, the prevalence and clinical significance of this translocation have not been examined previously in gastrointestinal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: Clinicopathologic and molecular features were investigated in 48 patients who had gastrointestinal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The site of involvement was the duodenum in 54% of patients, the jejunum in 52%, the ileum in 52%, the stomach in 29%, and the colorectum in 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of the t(14;18)/IGH-BCL2 translocation was detected by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: Treatment modalities included surgical resection (n = 16), rituximab plus chemotherapy (n = 13), rituximab alone (n = 6), antibiotics (n = 5), and watchful waiting (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete remission (CR) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was achieved in 31 patients (65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall survival and event-free survival rates after 5 years were 93% and 68%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18)/IGH-BCL2 was detected in 39 patients (81%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The involvement of multiple sites (69% vs 0%), manifestation of the lymphomatous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> type (72% vs 22%), and histologic grade 1 or 2 tumors (92% vs 56%) were more frequent in the t(14;18)-positive group than in the negative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the CR rate was lower in the t(14;18)-positive group than in the negative group (56% vs 100%; P = .0179), and a trend was observed toward poorer event-free survival in the positive group (P = .089) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: The t(14;18)/IGH-BCL2 chromosomal translocation occurred frequently in gastrointestinal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The current results indicated that this translocation may be a predictor of an adverse clinical course </plain></SENT>
