<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was designed to evaluate the benefit of this strategy by retrospectively comparing for each patient the event-free survival (EFS) after ASCT with the duration of the disease phase just before the phase including ASCT (ie, the last qualifying phase, LQP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 109 indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (mostly follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) patients were treated with HDT and ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before ASCT, patients experienced a median of 2 disease phases (range, 1-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a median 5-year follow-up from ASCT, overall survival was 67% and EFS was 43% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When each of the 92 patients experiencing recurrence was taken as her/his own control, EFS was longer after ASCT than the duration of LQP (62%, P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During LQP, 86 patients (93%) experienced recurrence in less than 5 years, compared with only 58 (63%) who experienced recurrence in the 5 years after ASCT (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HDT and ASCT can significantly increase EFS in comparison with the duration of the LQP for indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients and can change disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This methodology has been found useful for evaluating new strategies, especially with monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
