<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical impact of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use on the outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients treated with a rituximab-containing regimen is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with newly diagnosed, diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) were enrolled onto a registry and observed prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The impact of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use on patients' outcomes was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and 293 patients with FL were enrolled from September 2002 through June 2007; 21% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and 19% of patients with FL were on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> at diagnosis, and 20% and 17% remained on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treatment, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and 39% of patients with FL received initial therapy containing rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up time was 47 months (range, 13 to 80 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statin</z:chebi> use had no impact on the overall response rate (P = .67), overall survival (P = .76), or event-free survival (EFS) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statin</z:chebi> use at diagnosis was associated with improved EFS in patients with FL (HR = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.77), including subgroups treated with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen (HR = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.14 to 1.07) and patients who were observed only (HR = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The concurrent use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> during the treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and FL in the rituximab era did not adversely affect outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The apparent benefit of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy on FL outcome requires further studies </plain></SENT>
