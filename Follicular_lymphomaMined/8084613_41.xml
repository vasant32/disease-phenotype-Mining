<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is results in deregulation of the BCL-2 gene and appears to play a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Various numbers of cells from a cell line derived spontaneously from a patient with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> bearing the t(14;18) translocation and negative for the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were injected by IP, IV, and SC routes into <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mice developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> bearing the t(14;18) translocation with as few as 5 x 10(6) cells within 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was determined by histological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The higher the cell inoculation the more rapidly the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Engraftment of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells was determined by PCR for the t(14;18) breakpoint region on peripheral blood samples and could be detected prior to development of overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Having established a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> model the cells were treated with antisense oligonucleotides to the first open reading frame of the BCL-2 gene prior to inoculation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Control treatments with sense and nonsense oligonucleotides was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 28 days the sense, nonsense and untreated cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice had developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, however, the antisense treated group failed to develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings demonstrate the modelling of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> bearing the t(14;18) translocation and the ability to modify the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> process with the use of antisense oligonucleotides to the BCL-2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Reduction of the BCL2 protein suppresses the oncogenic potential of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells confirming that it plays an essential role in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
