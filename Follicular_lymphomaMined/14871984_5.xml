<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Three CD19 and CD20 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> binding to HLA-A*0201 were identified and used to detect <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> specific CTLs by a quantitative real-time PCR to measure IFN-gamma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in 23 healthy individuals and 28 patients (18 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), 7 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and 1 large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">Peptide</z:chebi>-specific CTLs were expanded in culture with CD40-activated B cells to test lytic activity in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In healthy individuals, CD8+ T-cell responses were detected in one to CD19(74-82), in three to CD20(127-135), and three to CD20(188-196) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven of 27 patients (6 with CLL) had CD8+ T cells recognizing CD19(74-82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients responded to CD20(127-135) and three to CD20(188-196) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were CLL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD19(74-82)-specific CTLs from three patients were expanded over 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These cells were HLA-A*0201 specific and lytic for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-loaded antigen-presenting cells but not to malignant or unpulsed B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CTLs that recognize CD19 and CD20 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> exist in healthy individuals and may be increased in CLL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They are of low avidity and require high doses of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> for activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Strategies to increase T-cell avidity would be necessary for T-cell immunotherapeutic approaches using the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> studied </plain></SENT>
