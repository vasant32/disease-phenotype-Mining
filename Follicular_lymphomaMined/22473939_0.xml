<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over a median follow-up of 89 months with 65 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in this preliminary study, we identified 5 gene regions (BMP7, GALNT12,DUSP2, GADD45B, and ADAM17) that were associated with overall survival from FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results did not meet the criteria for statistical significance after adjustment for multiple hypothesis testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results,which support a role for host factors in determining the variable progression of FL, serve as an initial examination that can inform future studies of genetic variation and FL survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, they require replication in independent populations, as well as assessment in rituximab-treated patients </plain></SENT>
