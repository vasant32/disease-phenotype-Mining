<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Given the indolent behavior of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), it is controversial whether limited stage FL can be cured using radiotherapy (RT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the optimal RT field size is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors of this report investigated the long-term outcomes of patients with limited stage FL who received RT alone and studied the impact of reducing the RT field size from involved regional RT (IRRT) to involved node RT with margins up to 5 cm (INRT&lt;or=5 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eligible patients had limited stage, grade 1 through 3A FL diagnosed between 1986 and 2006 and treated were with curative-intent RT alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IRRT encompassed the involved lymph node group plus&gt;or=1 adjacent, uninvolved lymph node group(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INRT&lt;or=5 cm covered the involved lymph node(s) with margins&lt;or=5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 237 patients were identified (median follow-up, 7.3 years) and included 48% men, 54% aged&gt;60 years, stage IA disease in 76% of patients, elevated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) in 7% of patients, grade 3A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in 12% of patients, and lymph node size&gt;or=5 cm in 19% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 2 RT groups were IRRT (142 patients; 60%) and INRT&lt;or=5 cm (95 patients; 40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 10 years, the progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 49%, and the overall survival (OS) rate was 66% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 2 patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> beyond 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common pattern of first failure was a distant recurrence only, which developed in 38% of patients who received IRRT and in 32% of patients who received INRT&lt;or=5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After INRT&lt;or=5 cm, 1% of patients had a regional-only recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Significant risk factors for PFS were lymph nodes&gt;or=5 cm (P=.008) and male gender (P=.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for OS were age&gt;60 years (P&lt;.001), elevated LDH (P=.007), lymph nodes&gt;or=5 cm (P=.016), and grade 3A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (P=.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>RT field size did not have an impact on PFS or OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Disease recurrence after 10 years was uncommon in patients who had limited stage FL, suggesting that a cure is possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Reducing RT fields to INRT&lt;or=5 cm did not compromise long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
