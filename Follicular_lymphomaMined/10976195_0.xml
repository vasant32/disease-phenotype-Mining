<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> is important in several malignant diseases, such as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancies</z:e> (e.g. in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) or in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e>, due to the presence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden following a treatment of these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In case of t(14;18) chromosome translocation, which characterizes most of the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the bcl-2 gene translocates to the joining region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain of chromosome 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of bcl-2 gene alters due to the translocation, and this change results in the inhibition of cellular apoptotic processes, and in turn these series of events may finally lead to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is inevitable to learn the results of radio- and/or chemotherapy, i.e. whether the translocation-bearing cells disappeared from the lymphocytes of peripheral blood as well as from that of bone marrow, or we have to take into account the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using nested-PCR one can detect the translocation in 1 out of 10(5) cells, this way the results of the treatments can be controlled: one can establish the emergence of remissions; and the relapses could also be detected earlier than by using conventional diagnostic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our experience, yielded by the follow up studies of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, shows that the results of PCR detection correlate excellently with the conclusions of other diagnostic techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the t(14;18) translocation-bearing cells can also be detected in peripheral lymphocytes of healthy donors as well as in that of different diseases of other types than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but not in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore we emphasize the importance of the translocation-detection in the bone marrow of the patients of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More and more advanced techniques have made it possible to detect the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e>, this way it will be easier to diagnose and to predict the outcome of different malignant diseases </plain></SENT>
