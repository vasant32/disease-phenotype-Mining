<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For improving cytodiagnosis, we adapted computer-assisted polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays on cytologic specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These novel techniques aim at fluorescence-based sequencing and sizing of PCR products that result from NHL-specific markers, such as the chromosomal t(14;18) (q32;q21) translocation and the CDR3 regions of expanded B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Aspirates from eight cases with mixed-type follicular NHL and from nine cases with a cytologic finding of RLH were investigated by PCR and with an automated laser scanning system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PCR detected the t(14;18) translocation in 5/8 B cell NHL samples and 1/9 RLH samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By means of automated DNA sequencing, two of the five positive probes in the group of NHLs were identified as false positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CDR3 regions of expanded B-cell clones were found in four of eight NHL aspirates by means of PCR and computer-assisted analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study proved the reliability of automated genetic assays for diagnosing low grade B-cell NHLs in aspirates since false positive results are excluded </plain></SENT>
