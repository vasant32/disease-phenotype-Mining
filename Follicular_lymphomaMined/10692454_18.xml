<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, bcl-2 is translocated to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus leading to deregulation of bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the role of Myb proteins in the regulation of bcl-2 expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We showed that A-Myb up-regulates bcl-2 promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Northern and Western analyses demonstrated that A-Myb was expressed in the DHL-4 t(14;18) cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In t(14;18) cells and mature B cells, A-Myb up-regulated bcl-2 expression, whereas B- and c-Myb had little effect on bcl-2 gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Deletion analysis of the bcl-2 5'-region identified a region responsive to A-Myb in t(14;18) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A potential binding site for the Cdx homeodomain proteins was located in this sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the A-Myb-responsive region by UV cross-linking experiments revealed that a 32-kDa protein formed a complex with this region, but direct binding by Myb proteins could not be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A-Myb could be recovered along with Cdx2 when nuclear extracts were passed over the Cdx site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mutagenesis of the Cdx binding site abolished binding by the 32-kDa protein and significantly reduced the ability of A-Myb to induce bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A strong induction of bcl-2 P2 promoter activity was observed in cotransfection studies of DHL-4 cells with the A-Myb and Cdx2 expression vectors, and increased endogenous Bcl-2 protein expression was observed in B cells transfected with A-Myb and/or Cdx2 expression constructs </plain></SENT>
