<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many recent studies have also reported on the prognostic significance of CA-125 in patients with different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but only a few studies have been carried out in patients treated with rituximab or high-dose therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prognostic impact of CA-125 on a large cohort of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) has not been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study analyzed the prognostic significance of CA-125 levels in 116 prospectively enrolled patients with previously untreated FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It showed that the CA-125 level at the time of treatment initiation correlates with the clinical stage, number of involved nodal areas, bulky disease, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level, beta-2 microglobulin level, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with CA-125 &gt;35 U/mL had significantly shorter progression-free (p &lt; 0.001) and overall (p = 0.025) survival rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis identified high CA-125 levels as a prognostic factor for overall (HR 3.04, p = 0.05) and progression-free (HR 3.55, p &lt; 0.001) survival rates independent of FLIPI score variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CA-125 levels may help to refine risk assessment in the modern immunotherapy era </plain></SENT>
