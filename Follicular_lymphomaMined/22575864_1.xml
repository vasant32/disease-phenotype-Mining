<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Molecular testing for mutations activating the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-associated protein kinase signaling pathway is being used to help diagnose <z:hpo ids='HP_0002890'>thyroid carcinomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the prevalence of these mutations in thyroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we studied the prevalence of BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, and KRAS mutations in 33 thyroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and correlated the mutational status with the clinical, pathological, cytogenetic, and immunophenotypic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven cases were also tested for PAX8/PPARγ translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> included 25 diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 6 extranodal marginal-zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type, and 2 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventeen diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were germinal center type, six non-germinal center type, and two unclassifiable (Hans algorithm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the cases had an associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002890'>thyroid carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutations of the BRAF gene were identified in six (24%) diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (D594G in three germinal center diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, K601N in two germinal center diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and V600E in one non-germinal center diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) and of the NRAS gene in two (8%) non-germinal center diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (Q61K and Q61H) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BRAF and NRAS mutations were not found in any extranodal marginal-zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HRAS and KRAS mutations were not identified in any of the cases, nor were PAX8/PPARγ translocations found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, interpretation of finding a BRAF or NRAS mutation in the thyroid, particularly in preoperative thyroid aspirates, must take into account the differential diagnosis of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition to the diagnostic importance, our data also demonstrate that alteration in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-associated protein kinase pathway may have a role in the pathogenesis of some large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the thyroid with potential therapeutic implications </plain></SENT>
