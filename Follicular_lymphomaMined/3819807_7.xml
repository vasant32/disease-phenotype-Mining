<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A pure nodular pattern (NN), defined as nodularity involving 75% or more of the cross-sectional area, was found to be an important favorable prognostic indicator as compared with a nodular-diffuse pattern (ND) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median survival in 336 patients with NN of 68.2 months was significantly better than the 39.6 months in 87 patients with ND (P less than .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median survival in NN-lymphocytic poorly differentiated (LPD) was 77.2 months v 44.3 months for ND-LPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NN-M median survival of 56.4 months contrasted with only 25.5 months for ND-mixed lymphocytic and histiocytic (M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of nodularity as defined in this study appears to have significant prognostic implication and should be more widely used by pathologists </plain></SENT>
