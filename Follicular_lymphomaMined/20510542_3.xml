<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We combined external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">yttrium</z:chebi>-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan ((90)Y-IT) in an attempt to improve therapeutic response in patients with relapsed or refractory bulky follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (RRBFL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between February 2006 and September 2007, 11 patients with RRBFL were treated with EBRT followed by (90)Y-IT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bulky disease (BD) was defined as &gt;5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EBRT was delivered to BD as 2,400 cGy in eight fractions using computed tomography (CT)-based planning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BD was contoured as the gross <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A planning margin of 1 to 2 cm was added depending on anatomical location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After recovery of complete blood counts (CBC), (90)Y-IT was administered at a dose of 0.3 or 0.4 mCi/kg depending on platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hematologic toxicity was monitored through weekly CBC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Response was measured by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography/CT or CT 3-4 months after (90)Y-IT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only 2 patients required prolonged breaks between EBRT and (90)Y-IT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median time after (90)Y-IT for platelets to recover to &gt;100,000/ml was 55 days (range, 41-128 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Platelet counts for 1 patient, who had received 4 previous chemotherapy regimens, never reached 100,000/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The complete and overall responses to combined therapy as measured 3-4 months after (90)Y-IT were 64% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No patients relapsed within the EBRT field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 36.1 months, 6 patients have relapsed, 2 of whom have died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival was 17.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to prior failure analysis data for RRBFL patients treated with (90)Y-IT alone, a brief course of EBRT prevented relapse in sites of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>EBRT used to pretreat bulky sites may improve clinical outcomes and potentially extend survival when combined with (90)Y-IT </plain></SENT>
