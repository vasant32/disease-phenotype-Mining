<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy schedules including non-pegylated liposomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> in patients with NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of NHL patients treated with non-pegylated liposomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> in two hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each patient demographic data, clinical and biological variables, as well as therapy, response and toxicity were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were included, 14 (58%) of them were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median age was 76 years (range 42-86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequent histological diagnosis was diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, 20 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The stage disease at diagnosis was III/IV in 19 (73%) patients whereas 12 (57%) of the 21 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and grade 3 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had a high-risk International Prognostic Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients had a left ventricular ejection fraction lower than 50% at the time of starting treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factor</z:e> was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (50% of the patients) and 6 (23%) had previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases non-pegylated liposomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> was administered as part of the R-COMP schedule (rituximab, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, vincristin, non-pegylated liposomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>), in 20 cases (73%) as first-line treatment and in the remaining 6 as salvage therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients died after the first cycle of chemotherapy (one because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> and the other due to disease progression) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Eleven (61%) out of the 18 patients receiving R-COMP as first-line therapy achieved a complete response (CR), 5 (28%) achieved partial response (PR) and 2 showed progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Only one out of the 6 patients receiving R-COMP as salvage therapy achieved CR, whereas 3 had PR and 2 did not respond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 or 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> was observed in 11 (46%) patients and febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in 10 (42%), while only one patient developed grade 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival was 50,7 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 8-93.3) and the median disease free survival was 18,4 months (95% CI 18.1-18.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients, most of them old and with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, the administration of non-pegylated liposomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> as part of R-COMP regimen was effective and safe </plain></SENT>
