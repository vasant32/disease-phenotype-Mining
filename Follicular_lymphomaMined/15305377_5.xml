<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we for the first time investigated by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) the prevalence of cyclin D3 abnormalities in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs), comparing the results with traditional clinicopathologic characteristics, p27 and skp2 immunoreactivity (IR) and Ki-67 labeling index (LI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cyclin D3, skp2 and Ki-67 IR significantly increased from grade I to grade III FL (p = 0.0003, p = 0.0001 and p &lt; 0.0001, respectively), while p27 IR was significantly (p &lt; 0.0001) more prevalent in low-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cyclin D3 IR was directly correlated with the Ki-67 LI (p &lt; 0.0001) and inversely correlated with p27 IR (p = 0.050) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the 13 cases analyzed by FISH showed the t(6;14) translocation, but in 2 (15.3%) grade I FLs 3 cyclin D3 signals were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cohybridization with probes specific for the centromeric region and the long arm of the chromosome 6 indicated <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> in one case and a pattern highly suggestive for the presence of an isochromosome 6p in the other case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the t(6;14) translocation may be extremely uncommon in FL and that a deregulated expression of cyclin D3, possibly due to epigenetic mechanisms, may be involved in the pathogenesis of high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
