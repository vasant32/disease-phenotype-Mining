<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Deletions of the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q) are among the most frequent chromosome aberrations in malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and often occur as secondary changes in addition to typical translocations, such as t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with two YAC probes hybridizing to 6q23-24 and with the centromeric probe D6Z1 as internal control, we studied 31 cases of low-grade and eight cases of high-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Deletions of 6q23-24 were detected in 21 patients (56.8%) by FISH, compared to 13 patients (33.3%) by chromosome analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Deletions of 6q23-24 were found by FISH in 5 of 13 cases of small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, in 2 of 3 cases of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, in 10 of 14 cases of t(14;18) positive low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and in 4 of 8 cases of high-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study shows that deletions of 6q23-24 are more frequent in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> than previously suggested and that they can be detected more sensitively by FISH than by chromosome analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contrary to previous reports indicating that the region 6q23-24 is preferentially deleted in low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> without t(14;18), our results indicate that deletions of 6q23-24 appear to be common in other pathological subsets of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> as well, especially in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
