<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the exception of pediatric follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with IRF4-translocation, the genetic events associated with these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> have not yet been defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We applied array-comparative genomic hybridization and molecular inversion probe assay analyses to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from 18 patients aged â‰¤18 years with IRF4 translocation negative follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only six of 16 evaluable cases displayed chromosomal imbalances with gains or amplifications of 6pter-p24.3 (including IRF4) and deletion and copy number neutral-loss of heterozygosity in 1p36 (including TNFRSF14) being most frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of TNFRSF14 located in the minimal region of loss in 1p36.32 showed nine mutations in seven cases from our series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two subsets of pediatric follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were delineated according to the presence of molecular alterations, one with genomic aberrations associated with higher grade and/or diffuse-large-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> component and more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849867" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">widespread disease</z:e>, and another one lacking genetic alterations associated with more limited disease </plain></SENT>
