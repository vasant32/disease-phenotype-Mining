<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aim of the F2 study was to verify whether a prospective collection of data would enable the development of a more accurate prognostic index for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) by using parameters which could not be retrospectively studied before, and by choosing progression-free survival (PFS) as principal end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2003 and May 2005, 1,093 patients with a newly diagnosed FL were registered and 942 individuals receiving antilymphoma therapy were selected as the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The variables we used for score definition were selected by means of bootstrap resampling procedures on 832 patients with complete data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Procedures to select the model that would minimize errors were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 38 months, 261 events for PFS evaluation were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>beta2-microglobulin higher than the upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, longest diameter of the largest involved node longer than 6 cm, bone marrow involvement, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level lower than 12 g/dL, and age older than 60 years were factors independently predictive for PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using these variables, a prognostic model was devised to identify three groups at different levels of risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 3-year PFS rate was 91%, 69%, and 51% for patients at low, intermediate, and high risk, respectively (log-rank = 64.6; P &lt; .00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 3-year survival rate was 99%, 96%, and 84% for patients at low, intermediate, and high risk, respectively (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index 2 is a simple prognostic index based on easily available clinical data and may represent a promising new tool for the identification of patients with FL at different risk in the era of immunochemotherapy </plain></SENT>
