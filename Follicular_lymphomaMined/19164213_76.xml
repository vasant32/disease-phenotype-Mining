<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cetuximab may also exert antitumor effects through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in which antibody Fc portion interacts with Fc receptors (FcgammaRs) expressed by immune cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ADCC is influenced by FcgammaRIIa-H131R and FcgammaRIIIa-V158F polymorphisms that are clinically relevant in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> treated with rituximab and trastuzumab, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of FcgammaR polymorphisms and KRAS mutation with the outcome of irinotecan-refractory mCRC patients treated with cetuximab plus irinotecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues from 69 patients were screened for KRAS mutations using a sensitive multiplex assay and genotyped for FcgammaRIIa and FcgammaRIIIa polymorphisms by direct sequencing and multiplex allele-specific polymerase chain reaction, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results were correlated with response and progression-free survival (PFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: KRAS mutations were associated with lower response rate (4% v 27% in nonmutated patients; P = .021) and shorter PFS (3.0 v 5.3 months; P = .021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with FcgammaRIIa-131H/H and/or FcgammaIIIa-158V/V genotypes had longer PFS than 131R and 158F carriers (5.5 v 3.0 months; P = .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference remained significant for mutated-KRAS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, KRAS mutation and FcgammaR combined status were independent risk factors for PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Combined FcgammaRIIa/FcgammaRIIIa polymorphisms are prognostic factors for disease progression in mCRC patients treated with cetuximab plus irinotecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As these polymorphisms are also clinically relevant in mutated-KRAS mCRC, an important role of ADCC in cetuximab efficacy is presumed </plain></SENT>
