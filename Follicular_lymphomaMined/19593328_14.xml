<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed 67 cases of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> for expression of SHH (ligand), GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3 (transcriptional effectors of SHH signaling), and the ATP-binding cassette (ABC)G2 (a downstream target of SHH signaling), using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For comparison, we assessed the expression levels of these proteins in 28 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 5 reactive lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, SHH was expressed in 61 of 67 (91%) cases, GLI1 in 62 of 67 (93%), GLI2 in 41 of 56 (73%), and GLI3 in 22 of 56 (39%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of ABCG2 was detected in 52 of 55 (95%) cases and was high in 15 (27%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SHH expression positively correlated with expression levels of ABCG2 (P=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with high ABCG2 expression showed significantly shorter overall survival (P=0.031) and failure-free survival (P=0.029) compared with patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with low or no expression of ABCG2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> expressed SHH, and GLI1, GLI2, and GLI3 more frequently and more intensely than cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data show that SHH signaling proteins and ABCG2 are aberrantly expressed in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and that ABCG2 expression has prognostic implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings also provide evidence that dysregulation of the SHH pathway may be involved in the pathogenesis of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
