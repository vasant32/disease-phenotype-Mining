<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a previous criterion-based pathology report review of 717 cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in an Australian population-based epidemiologic study, a WHO category could be assigned in 91% of cases, but confidence in this classification was high in only 57.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given this lack of confidence, a pathology review was done in a subset of 315 cases, with the aims of assigning a WHO classification category and the corresponding International Classification of Diseases for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo>, Third Edition code in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases previously unclassified or classified with low confidence and testing the accuracy of report review in assigning a confident WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After pathology review, 10 cases were ineligible (not non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 3.2%) and 99% (301 of 305) of the remainder were assigned a WHO classification, with high confidence in 87% (261 of 301) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was 78% overall agreement between the WHO classification assigned by report review and pathology review, with 92% agreement when there was high confidence in the report review classification and 69% agreement when there was low confidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighteen percent of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 23% of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were reclassified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pathology review increased the accuracy of WHO classification by an estimated 12.5% in the 694 cases who were still eligible in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although a potential error rate of 7.5% remained, reviewing more cases, or not reviewing any cases classified with high confidence, would have produced only a small change in accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Criterion-based pathology report review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases followed by selective pathology review in cases classified with low confidence is recommended as a cost-saving and accurate strategy for pathology review in large epidemiologic studies </plain></SENT>
