<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report on the case of a patient enrolled in a protocol of active idiotypic immunotherapy in which previous cytofluorometric analysis showed a major IgM+, kappap+ population in the tumoral cell suspensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, sequence analysis of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> sample and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-derived hybrids revealed the presence of two unrelated clones that used different VH and VK gene segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was possible to obtain hybridomas secreting these two different IgM, kappap idiotypic proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient was immunised with a mixture of these two idiotypic Igs conjugated to keyhole limpet haemocyanin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-idiotypic antibodies directed against both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-associated proteins were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first case of anti-idiotypic therapy in a patient with a biclonal NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our work calls attention to the question of clonality in the context of idiotypic vaccination in NHL patients </plain></SENT>
