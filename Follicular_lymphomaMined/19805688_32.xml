<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Lenalidomide is a novel immunomodulatory agent with antiproliferative activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given its efficacy in a wide range of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>, we conducted a phase II trial (NHL-001) of single-agent lenalidomide in indolent non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with relapsed/refractory indolent NHL were eligible, with no limit on the number of previous therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oral lenalidomide 25 mg was self-administered once daily on days 1 to 21 of every 28-day cycle for up to 52 weeks as tolerated, or until disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR), with secondary end points of duration of response (DR), progression-free survival (PFS), and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-three enrolled patients were assessable for response and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients received a median of three prior systemic therapies (range, 1 to 17) and half were refractory to last therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ORR was 23% (10 of 43), including a 7% complete response (CR) or unconfirmed CR rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven percent (six of 22) of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade 1 or 2, and 22% (four of 18) with small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> responded to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median DR was not reached, but was longer than 16.5 months with seven of 10 responses ongoing at 15 to 28 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median PFS for the whole group was 4.4 months (95% CI, 2.5 to 10.4 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were predictable and manageable; the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (30% and 16%, respectively) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (14% and 5%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Oral lenalidomide monotherapy produces durable responses with manageable adverse events in patients with relapsed/refractory indolent NHL, warranting further investigation of treatment for indolent NHL </plain></SENT>
