<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported a strong expression of B7-1 on Reed-Sternberg cells and anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here our findings on B7-2 expression by malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (n = 70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>B7-2 was present on the neoplastic cells of anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in two of three cases studied, and on a subpopulation of the malignant cells in one out of four cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>B7-2 was not expressed by the neoplastic cells of the other non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (n = 32), including T cell-rich B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Reed-Sternberg cells in lymph nodes affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> are strongly positive for B7-2 (n = 31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evidence for a functional correlate of this expression was obtained by our findings that the combination of anti-B7-1 and anti-B7-2 monoclonal antibodies was more effective than each separately in blocking allogeneic T cell activation (proliferation and cytokine secretion) by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>-derived cell lines as stimulators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The possible role of B7-1 and B7-2 expression for the course and symptomatology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> is discussed </plain></SENT>
