<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the light of rampant human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndrome, largely centred in sub-Sahara, this experience is updated in a further 512 consecutive individuals treated over an 8-year period in a privately based academic centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median age was 55.2 years 61% were males, 10% had Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and, overall, constitutional symptoms were present in 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prior to referral 19% had received chemotherapy and a further 20% some form of irradiation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was followed by 32 months for those with mantle cell (n=7), splenic (n=2) and extranodal marginal cell (n=11), 24 months for T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (n=24), 20 months for diffuse large B-cell variants (n=88) but only 12 months for the aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> exemplified by Burkitt (n=7) and lymphoblastic subtypes (n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining 36 patients had to be excluded because numbers were too small for statistical analysis or unreliable staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adverse factors were constitutional symptoms, prior treatment with chemotherapy, intermediate or high-risk scores as defined by the international prognostic index, histologic grading and certain anatomical sites of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall survival at 3 years in each category was compared to the curve for the entire cohort and was 100% in hairy cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> receiving two chlorodeoxyadenosine and greater than 88% in Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated according to the German study group protocols (p=0.0004) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Outcome argues in favour of patient management by a multidisciplinary team implicit in which are standardised protocols for diagnosis, staging and treatment </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conversely any deviation from such a disciplined approach is unlikely to achieve comparable benefit and therefore to be strongly discouraged </plain></SENT>
