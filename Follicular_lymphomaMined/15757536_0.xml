<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVE: Fas and FasL have been proved to be the inductional genes of cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genesis of many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> relates with functional disorder and abnormal expressions of Fas and FasL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to detect protein expressions of Fas and FasL in B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B-NHL) and benign lymphoid tissue, and to provide new markers for diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to detect protein expressions of Fas and FasL in 92 specimens of B-NHL, and 20 specimens of benign lymphoid tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fas mostly expressed on membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FasL mostly expressed in cytoplasm, and partially expressed in nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positive rate of Fas in B-NHL was 66.3% (61/92), and that of FasL in B-NHL was 67.4% (62/92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Positive rates of both Fas and FasL in benign lymphoid tissue were 60.0% (12/20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in expressions of Fas and FasL between B-NHL group and benign group (P&gt;0.05), but positive locations of Fas and FasL in these 2 groups are different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Positive rates of Fas and FasL were higher in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLBL) than in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), and small cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>) (87.2% vs. 64.5%, and 31.8%, P&lt;0.05u 89.7% vs. 67.7%, and 27.3%, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Positive rates of Fas and FasL in FL were higher than those in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between Fas/FasL expression and patients' gender, age, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The expressions of Fas and FasL are not useful for distinguishing benign lymphoid tissue from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissue, while their locational characteristics are valuable for differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The expressions of Fas and FasL are considered valuable in evaluating the malignant grade of B-NHL </plain></SENT>
