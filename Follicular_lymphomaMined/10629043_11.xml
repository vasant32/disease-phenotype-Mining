<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, 70% of the t(14,18) translocations are confined to three 15-bp clusters positioned within a 150-bp region (major breakpoint region or [MBR]) in the untranslated portion of terminal exon 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed DNA-protein interactions in the MBR, as these may play some role in targeting the translocation to this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An 87-bp segment (87MBR) immediately 3' to breakpoint cluster 3 was essential for DNA-protein interaction monitored with mobility shift assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further delineated a core binding region within 87MBR: a 33-bp, very AT-rich sequence highly conserved between the human and mouse BCL2 gene (37MBR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have purified and identified one of the core factors as the matrix attachment region (MAR) binding protein, SATB1, which is known to bind to AT-rich sequences with a high propensity to unwind </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional factors in nuclear extracts, which we have not yet characterized further, increased SATB1 affinity for the 37MBR target four- to fivefold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specific binding activity within 37MBR displayed cell cycle regulation in Jurkat T cells, while levels of SATB1 remained constant throughout the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, we demonstrated in vivo binding of SATB1 to the MBR, strongly suggesting the BCL2 major breakpoint region is a MAR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We discuss the potential consequences of our observations for both MBR fragility and regulatory function </plain></SENT>
