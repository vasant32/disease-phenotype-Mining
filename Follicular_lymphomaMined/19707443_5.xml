<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rituximab, a monoclonal anti-CD20 chimeric antibody, now has been widely evaluated in the various B-cell lymphatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Large phase III studies helped to prove the value of this drug in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> as part of induction or relapse treatment as well as maintenance treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The addition of rituximab to the well established CHOP regimens has increased achievable cure rates in diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and this combination is now accepted worldwide as standard of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although conflicting results are available, rituximab is widely used for the treatment of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the less frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> entities phase 2 studies show a considerable efficiency for most of these B-NHL variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Current research focuses on combined chemoimmunotherapy approaches, optimization of dosing regimens, and combination with novel agents </plain></SENT>
