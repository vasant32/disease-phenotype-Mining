<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This multicenter phase II study evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of cladribine with rituximab (R-2-CdA) therapy in relapsed or refractory indolent B-NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients with the median age of 58.5 yrs (range, 42-72) were enrolled and received R-2-CdA therapy from April 2005 to July 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median number of prior regimens was 2 (range, 1-3), and fifteen patients (75%) were previously treated with rituximab-containing regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disease histology included follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 16 patients, MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in two patients, nodal marginal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in one patient, and lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate (ORR) was 90%, with a complete response rate (CRR) of 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Estimated median progression-free survival (PFS) time was 22.4 months (95%CI, 10.9-32.6 months) at a median follow-up time of 27 months (range, 12-43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two-year PFS and 2-yr overall survival (OS) were 52.6% (95%CI, 31.0-73.2%) and 89.5% (95%CI, 66.1-97.3%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 or grade 4 toxicities were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in 74% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>R-2-CdA therapy was demonstrated to have a high activity with durable PFS and acceptable toxicity in relapsed or refractory indolent B-NHL mostly pretreated with rituximab-containing therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although a large-scale trial is needed for confirmation, R-2-CdA therapy could be a good salvage therapy option in relapsed or refractory indolent B-NHL </plain></SENT>
