<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although lymphoid tissues from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> transgenic mice contained high levels of human Bcl-2 protein, transgene expression was differentially regulated within the B- and T-cell compartments of lines derived from various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have characterized the phenotypes of two lines of bcl-2 transgenic mice (line 2 and line 6) in which bcl-2 transgene expression was restricted primarily to the T- or B-cell lineages, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of line 6 lymphocytes revealed a polyclonal expansion of B cells, and these B cells exhibited prolonged survival in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In line 2 mice, numbers of T cells in the peripheral lymphoid tissues were more moderately elevated despite enhanced T-cell survival in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Line 2 transgenic mice also showed significantly increased proportions of thymocytes with a mature phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these findings suggest different roles for bcl-2 in the in vivo regulation of B- and T-cell development and homeostasis </plain></SENT>
