<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical and pathological features of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and to evaluate the applicability of the new WHO classification of lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: According to the new WHO classification, a total of 500 cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosed during the period 1992 - 2003 were reviewed and reappraised with their morphological, immunological and clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical survival analysis was performed in 156 cases that accompanied with follow-up data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 500 cases previously diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 493 cases (98.6%) were confirmed to be NHL, of which B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> was 69.0% and T/NK-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> 29.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, 6 subtypes including diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), unspecified peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (PT-un), precursor T-lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (T-LBL), extranodal marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of MALT type (MALT) and B-small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>) were among the most common subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In pediatric and young patient populations, the most common subtypes were LBL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of LBL in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, especially in the juniors, was much higher than those reported outside Mainland China, and the frequency of FL was much higher than the reported in Mainland China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of FL was much higher than the reported in Mainland China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical survivals among different histological subtypes of NHL varied considerably with statistic significance (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e> demonstrated the best prognosis, LBL and PT-un both the worst, whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and FL had an intermediate prognosis, however, subgrouping of FL according to WHO classification did not reveal a significant survival difference (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Basing upon the results of a comprehensive survey on the morphologic features, immunophenotyping and clinical data of the above cases, the new WHO classification of lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> is practical and easily applicable for routine pathological evaluation of lymphoproliferaive disorders and in guiding the clinical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It appears that the diagnostic and grading criteria for FL in Mainland China need to be re-evaluated </plain></SENT>
