<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The B-cell type was characterized by presence of intracellular monoclonal immunoglobulin; negative or weakly positive diffuse acid phosphatase activity; and an occasional focal nodular pattern or preceding nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The T-cell type was characterized by moderate, focal acid phosphatase activity; convoluted nuclear structure; and frequent preceding cutaneous manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The histiocytic type was characterized by strong nonspecific esterases and diffuse acid phosphatase activity and presence of lysozyme and phagocytic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of the lesions (74 cases) were of the B-cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This group was further subdivided into follicular center cell type and B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>, according to the stage of cellular transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preliminary clinical correlation suggests that the histiocytic type is most resistant to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo> were much more aggressive than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> of the follicular center cell type </plain></SENT>
