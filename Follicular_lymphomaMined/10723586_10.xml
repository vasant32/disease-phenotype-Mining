<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a quantitative analysis of circulating t(14;18)-positive cells is of prognostic significance in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) after myelo-ablative therapy supported by ABMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested DNA from primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissue as well as PBMC before and after ABMT from 15 patients for the presence of the t(14;18) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine patients showed a t(14;18) translocation, six patients were t(14;18)-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Circulating t(14;18)-positive cells of seven patients were quantitatively determined by limiting dilution assays combined with a two-step PCR and by real-time quantitative PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of both methods correlate very well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of circulating t(14;18)-positive cells decreased significantly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients after myeloablative therapy and ABMT, t(14;18)-negative blood samples were found in five of seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients circulating t(14;18)-positive cells reappeared within 2 years after ABMT showing two different patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During continuous CR the numbers of circulating t(14;18)-positive cells were found to be stable within one order of magnitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in one patient the relapse was accompanied by a logarithmic increase of t(14;18)-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a second patient the enlargement of lymph nodes developing over a period of 12 months was accompanied by very slowly increasing numbers of t(14;18)-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases where diagnostic lymph node tissue was available, the same t(14;18) translocation was found at first diagnosis and after ABMT as shown by nucleotide sequence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the quantitative detection of circulating t(14;18)-positive cells during follow-up of patients with FL after ABMT reflects the clinical course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Relapses are associated with increasing numbers of circulating t(14;18)-positive cells and continuous complete remissions with stable cell counts </plain></SENT>
