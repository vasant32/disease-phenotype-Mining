<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 27 cases tested, 26 were B-1-positive and 22 of 24 cases were HLA-DR positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were eight BA-1-positive cases, including one follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 10 J-5-positive cases including five diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some of the J-5-positive diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were considered to be of follicular center cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infiltration and distribution of non-neoplastic T cell subsets, BA-1-positive B cells, dendritic reticulum cells, Langerhans cells and HNK cells showed close similarity between the structure of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and that of the reactive follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such similarity to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterpart structure was less apparent in diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, especially in the large cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings were interpreted to be an expression of different degrees of neoplastic deviation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was evidence to suggest that, regardless of the histological classification, a large number of infiltrating non-neoplastic T cells was related to good prognosis </plain></SENT>
