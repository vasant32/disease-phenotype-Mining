<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Morphological criteria provide basic data determining their dignity, but concerning microfocal infiltrates, these criteria are rather inaccurate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, by examination of immunoglobulin H (IgH) receptor rearrangement and comparison of medullar and nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> sites, diagnostic reliability was improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Employing non-nested IgH rearrangement analysis with FR3A and JHa consensus primers, B-cell clonality was assessed on glutardialdehyde fixed, decalcified BMB with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> infiltration and on the corresponding lymph node specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Malignancy</z:e> was confirmed when polymerase chain reaction (PCR) generated no more than two peaks and was observed in 60% of the medullar B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison of lymph node tissues and BMB revealed an identical pattern in 50% of the probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 25% of the cases a single clonal peak derived from the lymph node tissues was also observed in the BMB but was surrounded by additional peaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here, direct comparison of the data permitted determination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the BMB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, IgH FR3 PCR analysis is a suitable tool to examine small lymphoid infiltrates in BMB, and direct comparison with corresponding nodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> can further facilitate estimation of their dignity </plain></SENT>
