<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among germinal center (GC)-derived <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, a type of "in situ follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL)" has been described in which cells that strongly express BCL2 are observed in histologically abnormal follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this commentary, the author suggests that another GC-derived <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, ie, nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with a micronodular pattern in which small GCs or broken-up GCs are present within nodules, may be regarded as an early lesion limited to GC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Like "in situ FL," this is likely to be an in situ step that potentially leads to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
