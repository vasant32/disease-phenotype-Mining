<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have detected an acquired t(11;18)(q21;q21.1) in a patient with a MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This translocation has previously been described in two other patients with extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The BCL2 oncogene, which is located at band 18q21.3 and is activated by the t(14;18)(q32;q21) in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, was not rearranged in this case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This newly identified t(11;18) may be a recurring translocation specifically associated with MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genes located at the breakpoint sites of chromosome 11 and/or chromosome 18 may be crucial to the pathogenesis of this type of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
