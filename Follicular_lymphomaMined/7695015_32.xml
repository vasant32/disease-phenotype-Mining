<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gene encodes for a protein that preserves cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, allowing them to survive in G(o) phase even in the absence of essential growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of bcl-2 protein has been observed in most follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and in approximately 25% of high-grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, as well as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> such as <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> of the lung, prostate, and nasopharynx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed bcl-2 protein expression in cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>malignant melanoma</z:hpo> (MM) (29 cases) and benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0000995'>melanocytic nevi</z:hpo> (BMN) (35 cases) using a high specific anti-bcl-2 monoclonal antibody with a standard three-step immunoperoxidase technique on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High levels of bcl-2 protein were observed in 27 of 29 MM (93.1%) and 33 of 35 BMN (94.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that bcl-2 protein expression is a common finding in cutaneous melanocytic lesions regardless of their biologic behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of the protein in the great majority of MM seems to exclude a prognostic significance of bcl-2 in MM of the skin </plain></SENT>
