<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 23 pediatric patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were identified, with a median age of 11 years and a male-to-female ratio of 2.3:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 19 patients for whom presenting clinical features were available, 15 patients had stage I, 1 had stage II, and 3 had stage III or IV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> had a follicular architecture, and 74% of cases had grade 2 or 3 histologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients expressed CD20 and bcl-6, and 80% were positive for CD10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 expression was detected in only 5 of 16 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this finding, bcl-2 gene rearrangements were detected in only 2 of 16 cases by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These patients were treated primarily with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy; 4 patients also received involved-field irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 13 patients with available clinical follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 2 achieved durable clinical remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Importantly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> diffusely positive for bcl-2 either presented with stage III/IV disease or had disease refractory to therapy, whereas patients with bcl-2-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> uniformly had stage I disease, achieved complete remission, and experienced no relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that, in contrast to adult follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, dysregulated bcl-2 expression does not play a significant pathogenetic role in most pediatric follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, bcl-2 expression in pediatric follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> identifies a subset of patients in whom disease is often disseminated at clinical presentation and is more refractory to combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
