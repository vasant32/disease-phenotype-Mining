<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The children's ages ranged from 3 to 13 years (median 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four patients presented with localized peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, two with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of the digestive tract, two with disseminated disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five were tentatively classified as stage I or II and 3 as stage IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The existence of other diseases responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> could satisfactorily be exclued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients are alive after follow-up periods of 1 to 14 years from diagnosis (median 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Morphologically, 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were mixed and 3 histiocytic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The growth pattern was "expansile" in the younger patients (3 to 9 years), and "infiltrative," as in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277562" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adult disease</z:e>, in the three older children (11 to 13 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The histiocytic cytology correlated with stage IV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FL in children appears to be different from both its adult counterpart and the diffuse childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Differences with the former include the absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of poorly differentiated lymphocytic type, the higher frequency of stage I-II disease and the better prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This last feature, as well as the higher frequency of peripheral node involvement and the absence of leukemic conversion or <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease, differentiates the follicular from the diffuse childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
