<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>After a prolonged period of chemotherapy for a disseminated nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, a 51-year-old woman developed a white lesion in the left macular region, in the absence of any overt lymphomatous disease elsewhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The initial <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> diagnosis was nonetheless a lymphomatous infiltrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to her severely immunocompromised state, the patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The involved left eye was examined postmortem by light and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> lesion was discovered to be caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with Toxoplasma gondii, which on postmortem evaluation was also found in the brain together with subclinical lymphomatous disease and multifocal leucoencelphalopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many viable and intact <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> were observed floating within the necrotic retina as well as lodged within recognizable <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most of the organisms were encysted bradyzoites, although a rare tachyzoite was discovered in the extracellular space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unusual features examined ultrastructurally were a preretinal membrane formed exclusively by glial cells, residual proliferating glial cells within the retina that were frequently related to surviving capillaries, and a multilaminar spindle cell placoid proliferation of pigment epithelial cells, assuming almost pseudo-sarcomatous proportions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Banded extracellular membrane material was focally observed between the proliferating pigment epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No neoplastic lymphoreticular cells were discovered within the choroid, but a curious feature was the production of basement membranes by the surviving choroidal melanocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040558" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Toxoplasmosis</z:e> should therefore be considered along with fungi and viruses in the differential diagnosis of white <z:hpo ids='HP_0007863'>retinal lesions</z:hpo> appearing in immunocompromised patients </plain></SENT>
