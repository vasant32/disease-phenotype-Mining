<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 39-year-old male with follicular non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was repeatedly studied with respect to DNA rearrangements with the two probes pFL-1 and pFL-2, representing two segments of chromosome 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The oncogene BCL2, detected by pFL-1, was as expected translocated to the J region of the immunoglobulin locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The standard BCL2 translocation was found in three samples, one obtained at diagnosis, one ten months later, and one after 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another translocation was found with the probe pFL-2 hybridizing with a region located about 20 kb 3' from BCL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This latter rearrangement was found only in the first biopsy, which was obtained at the time of diagnosis, but not in the two later samples, when the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No cytotoxic therapy had been given in the interval from diagnosis to disappearance of the latter rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, one of the observed translocations (pFL-2) was detected only in the first biopsy, while the other (pFL-1) was a clonal marker in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The finding suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> does not necessarily mean clinical progression </plain></SENT>
