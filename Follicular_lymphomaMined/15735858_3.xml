<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, extranodal marginal-zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (MZBLs) of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type also sometimes contain numerous lymphoid follicles and may even have a predominantly follicular growth pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, morphologic, immunohistochemical, and genotypic findings suggest that lymphoid follicles in extranodal MZBLs are neoplastic follicles formed as the result of colonization of previously reactive follicles by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells (centrocyte-like cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present here 6 cases of nodal MZBL demonstrating a follicular growth pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study demonstrated that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were CD10-, CD20+, CD79a+,CD138-, Bcl-2+, Bcl-6- and IRF4+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Residual nonneoplastic follicular center cells were CD10+, CD20+, CD79a+, Bcl-2-, and Bcl-6+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD21/CD23 immunostain demonstrated a disrupted follicular dendritic cell pattern characteristic of follicular colonization in extranodal MZBL of MALT type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken in conjunction with the morphologic findings, nodal MZBL may also show a follicular growth pattern similar to extranodal MZBL of MALT type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The marginal-zone nature is most recognizable on immunohistochemistry, although the histologic appearance alone may cause some diagnostic problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is important for pathologists to consider this type of lesion in diagnostic practice </plain></SENT>
