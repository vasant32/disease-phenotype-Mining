<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study observed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035288" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">reticuloendotheliosis</z:e> virus (REV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> occurring in a white Roman goose (Anser anser) farm in Yunlin, Taiwan in 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These geese showed growth-retarded and nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in the liver, lung, kidney, and pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty blood samples were taken for REV detection and 21 (70%) of them contained REV genetic sequences using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Virus isolation was attempted from 11 blood samples by inoculating the buffy coat onto DF1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine (81%) REVs were isolated after three blind passages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The complete proviral sequence from one isolate was determined for phylogenetic analysis by direct sequencing using overlapping PCR products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The length of the provial genome is 8284 nucleotides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By comparing with other published REV complete sequences, the nucleotide percent identity ranged from 93.5% to 99.8% with most LTR varieties, ranging from 74.9% to 99.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present isolated goose REV is most close to REV APC-566, a REV isolated from Attwater's Prairie chickens </plain></SENT>
