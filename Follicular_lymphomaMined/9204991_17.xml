<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The development of rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols for amplification of rearranged heavy chain immunoglobulin (IgH) gene sequences has facilitated the identification of clonal IgH rearrangements in non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> of B lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present report we have explored the recently described improved strategy for assessment of clonality of rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) genes in more detail in a series of 101 B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and 50 polyclonal controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The assay is based on an IgH-PCR with an automated fluorescence-based strategy for PCR detection of IgH gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Third complementarity determining region (IgH-CDR3) sequences were amplified using <z:chebi fb="2" ids="51121">fluorescent dye</z:chebi> labeled consensus primers homologous to the corresponding variable (V<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29235,33251">[H]</z:chebi>) and joining (J<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29235,33251">[H]</z:chebi>) gene segments in combination with a thermostable proofreading DNA polymerase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PCR products were size separated on a high resolution <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel and analyzed for clonality by exact size determination and fluorescence quantification in an automated DNA sequencer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PCR findings obtained with the optimized IgH-CDR3-PCR assay showed an overall monoclonality detection rate of 97% (97 of 101 cases with B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The specificity was 100% as determined by analysis of 50 controls, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which gave polyclonal PCR results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found a high rate of monoclonal IgH-CDR3-PCR results not only in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but also in the group of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, where a high rate of false negative results is frequently reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, we identified monoclonal IgH-CDR3 junctions in 55 out of 59 cases (93%) with B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in 42 of 42 (100%) cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytoma</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that automated fluorescence detection of IgH-CDR3-PCR products is an ideal tool for detection of clonal and polyclonal lymphoid B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In combination with allele-specific primers the procedure may improve current experimental approaches to detect occult malginant B cells during initial staging and follow-up of NHL and ALL patients </plain></SENT>
