<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this randomized multicenter study of 136 patients, 6 courses of CHOP (cyclo-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34714">phosphamide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>) followed by rituximab (CHOP-R) were compared with rituximab-supplemented high-dose sequential chemotherapy with autografting (R-HDS) to assess the value of intensified chemo-therapy as a first-line treatment for high-risk follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) after the introduction of monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The analysis was intention to treat with event-free survival (EFS) as the primary endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complete remission (CR) was 62% with CHOP-R and 85% with R-HDS (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up (MFU) of 51 months, the 4-year EFS was 28% and 61%, respectively (P &lt; .001), with no difference in overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular remission (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) was achieved in 44% of CHOP-R and 80% of R-HDS patients (P &lt; .001), and was the strongest independent outcome predictor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients relapsing after CHOP-R underwent salvage R-HDS in 71% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Salvage R-HDS had an 85% CR rate and a 68% 3-year EFS (MFU, 30 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that (1) achieving <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> is critical for effective disease control, regardless of which treatment is used; (2) R-HDS ensures superior disease control and molecular outcome than CHOP-R, but no OS improvement; and (3) CHOP-R failures have a good outcome after salvage R-HDS, suggesting that relapsed/refractory FL could be the most appropriate setting for R-HDS-like treatments </plain></SENT>
