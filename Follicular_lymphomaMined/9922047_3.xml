<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are associated with the t(14;18) translocation that juxtaposes the bcl-2 gene located on chromosome 18 to the immunoglobulin gene locus located on chromosome 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the bcl-2 gene is overly expressed and leads to an accumulation of mature clonal B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prolonged survival of the B cell clone appears to be the early event in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp>, creating an increased risk of cumulative mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, bcl-2/Ig gene rearrangements may be identified in nearly 50% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals but the outcome of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals carrying high levels of t(14;18) is not well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Persistent polyclonal B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo> (PPBL) is a unique polyclonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> mostly restricted to women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have recently demonstrated that PPBL is also associated with multiple bcl-2/Ig gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this report, we have extended our analysis to additional patients and demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients presented multiple detectable t(14;18) translocated clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, Bcl-2 protein expression was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings, along with the clinical features of PPBL, make this disorder an exceptional model for the study of B-cell homeostasis </plain></SENT>
