<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mediastinal large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are uncommon <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> that are thought to originate from thymic B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An unusual feature of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> is that they often lack surface immunoglobulin (Ig), a molecule ubiquitously expressed by most mature B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we have analyzed 12 cases of mediastinal large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> for the expression of the mb-1/CD79a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is a component, together with B29/CD79b, of a heterodimer that is associated with surface Ig on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to see whether loss of Ig in this type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is associated with loss of the accompanying CD79a molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have also evaluated 128 B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of other categories to see whether any of them show discordance between mb-1 and Ig expression and analyzed 30 T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> as Ig-negative controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that 5 of the 7 mediastinal large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with interpretable staining results for both mb-1 and Ig, lack Ig but expressed CD79a (mb-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This phenotype was very rare in other categories of B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, being found among 110 cases in only 5 cases that were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining 105 B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> displayed mb-1+/Ig+ phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 30 T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were mb-1 negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that discordant mb-1/Ig expression occurs commonly in mediastinal large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, the finding that 11 of 12 of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> express a phenotype (CD10-, CD19+, CD20+, CD21-, CD22+, CD23-/+) that is very similar to that described for thymic medullary B cells reinforces the idea that most mediastinal large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are of thymic B cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The correlation between mb-1 and Ig staining patterns in B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of other categories reveals that in the majority (90%), expression of the antigen receptor complex parallels that of mature B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data therefore confirm that the expression of the mb-1 protein provides independent strong evidence for the B lineage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and may be used for their routine phenotypic characterization </plain></SENT>
