<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little information is available because malignant cells differ from their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterparts for the cytokine repertoire they express </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we have investigated by reverse transcription-PCR the expression of 22 cytokine genes in neoplastic B lymphocytes from six patients with mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 10 with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 5 with marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterparts, i.e., naive, germinal center, and memory B cells, purified from tonsils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall profiles of cytokine gene expression in neoplastic B cells and in the corresponding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cell subsets were similar, but some "holes" in the repertoire of malignant versus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B lymphocytes were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Different "hole" combinations were identified consistently in mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, thus representing molecular fingerprints of each individual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> entity </plain></SENT>
