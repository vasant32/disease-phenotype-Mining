<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these studies, the coexpression rate of CD10 and Bcl-6 was relatively constant at 30% approximately 40%, but the frequency of Bcl-6+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> varied from 55% to 100%, raising doubts about the usefulness of Bcl-6 expression in identifying the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> of GC B-cell derivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because the expression of Bcl-6 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of non-GC B-cell origin has recently been reported, we critically evaluated the expression of Bcl-6 and CD10 in primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> of the tonsil, a relatively <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333132" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common tumor</z:e> in Japan and Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cases (n = 51) represented a consecutive series for any recent 2-year period at several teaching hospitals in Korea and Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens were used for immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Staining for Bcl-6 and CD10 was positive in 44 (86%) and 22 cases (45%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, among those positive for Bcl-6 (&gt;10% Bcl-6+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells), 2 basic patterns were recognized: uniform and nonuniform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The uniform pattern was characterized by a dense population (&gt;75%) and a consistent density in any given area, resembling the staining pattern observed in GC or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) (the "GC/FL" pattern) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the nonuniform pattern exhibited a varying density from area to area, as well as a less-dense population (&lt;75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The uniform pattern was observed in 26 cases (51%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but 1 (95%) of the CD10+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> coexpressed Bcl-6, with most (82%) displaying the uniform pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> showing a uniform pattern of Bcl-6 expression should be distinguished from those showing a nonuniform pattern, because the former most likely represent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of GC B-cell derivation and the latter most likely represent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of non-GC derivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>GC B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> thus defined accounted for 51% of tonsillar <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, a proportion comparable to that of the nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CD10 expression correlated with the "GC/FL" pattern, but appeared to be not essential for the identification of GC B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that a significant proportion of tonsillar <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> in Asia is of GC B-cell origin rather than of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This finding may have significance for clinical management of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
