<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine how combination of rituximab with chemotherapy influences TAM-associated clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Expression of a macrophage marker, CD68, was determined immunohistochemically from FL samples of 96 patients treated with rituximab and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>-Adriamycin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of them, 71 received therapy at diagnosis and 25 at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil and CD3+ lymphocyte counts were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up time for the cohort was 54 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourty-five patients previously treated with chemotherapy served as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Consistent with previous studies, high TAM amount was associated with adverse outcome in chemotherapy-treated patients (P = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, after rituximab and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> regimen, high TAM content correlated with longer survival rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>According to Kaplan Meier estimates, the median progression free survival (PFS) was not reached for patients with high TAM content compared with 45 months for patients with low TAM scores (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A trend toward a better overall survival (OS) at 5 years was also observed for patients with high TAM content (OS, 97% versus 90%, P = 0.116) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The positive prognostic value of TAMs was seen both for the patients treated at diagnosis and at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, TAM content remained an independent prognostic factor for OS and PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil and CD3+ lymphocyte counts did not correlate with outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that high TAM score is associated with a favorable prognosis in FL patients treated with immunochemotherapy </plain></SENT>
