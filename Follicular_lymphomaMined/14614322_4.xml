<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) for example, is characterized by the chromosomal translocation t(14;18), which results in bcl-2 overexpression and initiates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although FL cells possess ample amounts of bcl-2, they respond remarkably well to standard first-round chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the vast majority of patients relapses and becomes progressively resistant to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We obtained cell lines derived from chemosensitive and chemoresistant FL patients, that are characterized by the chromosomal translocation t(14;18) and expression of bcl-2, to investigate how chemotherapeutic drugs can circumvent bcl-2 anti-apoptotic function and to identify alterations in those pathways that may facilitate resistance to DNA damaging drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In chemosensitive FL cells, we found that DNA damaging drugs promote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> through p53-dependent upregulation of the TRAIL-DR5 receptor, resulting in activation of caspase-8 and downstream executioner caspases, thereby evading bcl-2 mediated suppression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Examination of drug resistant FL cell lines revealed that at least two defects in this pathway can contribute to chemotherapeutic resistance: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>p53 gene mutations that disable the transcriptional response to DNA damaging drugs, including expression of the TRAIL-DR5 receptor, and 2. transcriptional repression of the cell-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> executioner enzyme caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
