<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adding rituximab (Mabthera, Roche) to chemotherapy moderately improves survival time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rituximab is now authorised for long-term maintenance therapy in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in whom first-line chemotherapy induces a response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluation of rituximab in this setting is based on two unblinded randomised trials comparing rituximab maintenance therapy with watchful waiting in 1193 and 401 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither trial showed that rituximab had an impact on mortality or quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rituximab prolonged progression-free survival, based on unblinded assessment of radiological, laboratory or clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These trials suffer from biases that make it difficult to interpret the results, including the lack of blinding, premature termination and too short follow-up in the larger trial, and in the other trial, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> patient recruitment and use of a different dose regimen from that recommended in the summary of product characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both trials confirmed the adverse effect profile of rituximab, which includes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haematological disorders</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, and cardiac and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012242" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">digestive disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These adverse effects are severe in about 7% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There is also a riskof musculoskeletal and neuropsychiatric disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Questions still persist abouta possible oncogenic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In practice, the benefits of long-term rituximab maintenance therapy after a first line of chemotherapy remain to be demonstrated in terms of the length or quality of survival in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, while adverse effects are noteworthy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pending further data, rituximab should only be used in clinical trials in this specific setting </plain></SENT>
