<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> of lymphocytes, and there is growing evidence for a role of germline genetic variation in immune genes in NHL etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To identify susceptibility immune genes, we conducted a 2-stage analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from 1,253 genes using the Immune and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> Panel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Stage 1, we genotyped 7,670 SNPs in 425 NHL cases and 465 controls, and in Stage 2 we genotyped the top 768 SNPs on an additional 584 cases and 768 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association of individual SNPs with NHL risk from a log-additive model was assessed using the OR and 95% confidence intervals (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the pooled analysis, only the TAP2 coding SNP rs241447 (minor allele frequency = 0.26; Thr655Ala) at 6p21.3 (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.17-1.53) achieved statistical significance after accounting for multiple testing (P = 3.1 × 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The TAP2 SNP was strongly associated with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL, OR = 1.82, 95%CI 1.46-2.26; p = 6.9 × 10(-8)), and was independent of other known loci (rs10484561 and rs2647012) from this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The TAP2 SNP was also associated with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.08-1.77; P = 0.011), but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (OR = 1.08; 95% CI 0.88-1.32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher TAP2 expression was associated with the risk allele in both FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Genetic variation in TAP2 was associated with NHL risk overall, and FL risk in particular, and this was independent of other established loci from 6p21.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: Genetic variation in antigen presentation of HLA class I molecules may play a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
