<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objectives were (1) to investigate potential environmental and occupational risk factors of non-Hodgkin lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (NHLN), and (2) to explore the relationships between risk factors and NHLN subtypes according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The investigation was a hospital-based case-control study consisting of 649 newly diagnosed NHLN cases (August 2003 through January 2008) and 1298 individually gender-age-matched patient controls at 25 hospitals in Shanghai </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 17-page questionnaire was used to obtain information on demographics, medical history, family history, lifestyle risk factors, employment history, residential history, and occupational and non-occupational exposures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Certain occupations of interest triggered a second questionnaire, which was occupation-specific and asked for more details about jobs, tasks, materials used and work environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exposure assessments were based on the questionnaires, on-site workplace investigations, data published in the Chinese literature, historical exposure measurements maintained by government health agencies, and expert opinions of a panel of local scientists who were familiar with workplaces in Shanghai </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk estimates (odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals) of individual risk factors were calculated using conditional logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A number of potential environmental and occupational risk factors were associated with an increased risk of NHLN (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes combined) and/or individual subtypes; including home/workplace renovation, living on a farm, planting crops, raising livestock or animals, farm workers, fabric sewing and cutting workers, welders and sheet metal workers, masonry and plastering workers, product and chemical testing workers, toy manufacturing, agriculture industry, and beauty salon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exposures associated with an increased risk of NHLN (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes combined) and/or individual subtypes included <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>, solvents, petroleum fuels, metals, <z:chebi fb="57" ids="24852">insecticides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="95" ids="24527">herbicides</z:chebi>, fertilizers, and glues and adhesives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate models were used to adjust for potential confounding exposures, and several potential risk factors were subsequently eliminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of the investigation indicated that some risk factors applied to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> or most subtypes (e.g., <z:chebi fb="57" ids="24852">insecticides</z:chebi> and overall NHLN and subtypes of B-cell lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>), while others to specific subtypes only (e.g., <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, some risk factors were subtype-specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The difference in risk by subtype underscores the importance of the etiologic commonality and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of NHLN subtypes </plain></SENT>
