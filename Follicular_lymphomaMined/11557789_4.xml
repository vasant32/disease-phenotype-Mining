<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The description of primary cutaneous follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has raised interest in the differential diagnosis of this versus disseminated follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involving the skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here on four cases of Stage IV follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, diagnosed in skin biopsy, in which cutaneous lesion was the most noticeable feature of clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the morphological features were superimposed over typical nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Apart from classic B-cell markers, they were characterized by CD10 and bcl6 positivity, markers of follicle germinal center cells; and bcl2 expression, with a corresponding t(14;18) translocation in three of three cases examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four cases, bone marrow study and clinical staging revealed disease that had disseminated since diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up showed relapsing cutaneous and nodal disease in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The only difference observed with a control group of 10 cases of primary cutaneous follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was the absence in this group of t(14; 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disseminated classical follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has to be considered in the differential diagnosis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> presenting in the skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This series of cases suggests that the presence of t(14;18) could imply the existence of disease that has disseminated beyond the skin and that cases harboring this translocation could be candidates for systemic polychemotherapy </plain></SENT>
