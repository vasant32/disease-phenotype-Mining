<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotypic characterization of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (B-CLPD) is becoming increasingly complex due to usage of progressively larger panels of reagents and a high number of World Health Organization (WHO) entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Typically, data analysis is performed separately for each stained aliquot of a sample; subsequently, an expert interprets the overall immunophenotypic profile (IP) of neoplastic B-cells and assigns it to specific diagnostic categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We constructed a principal component analysis (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>)-based tool to guide immunophenotypic classification of B-CLPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three reference groups of immunophenotypic data files-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo> (B-CLL; n = 10), mantle cell (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>; n = 10) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL; n = 10)--were built </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, each of the 175 cases studied was evaluated and assigned to either one of the three reference groups or to none of them (other B-CLPD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most cases (89%) were correctly assigned to their corresponding WHO diagnostic group with overall positive and negative predictive values of 89 and 96%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The efficiency of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>-based approach was particularly high among typical B-CLL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> and FL vs other B-CLPD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>-guided immunophenotypic classification of B-CLPD is a promising tool for standardized interpretation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> IP, their classification into well-defined entities and comprehensive evaluation of antibody panels </plain></SENT>
