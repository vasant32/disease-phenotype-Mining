<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>For quantitative analysis of histopathological images, such as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grading systems, quantification of features is usually carried out on single cells before categorizing them by classification algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To this end, we propose an integrated framework consisting of a novel supervised cell-image segmentation algorithm and a new touching-cell splitting method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the segmentation part, we segment the cell regions from the other areas by classifying the image pixels into either cell or extra-cellular category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Instead of using pixel color intensities, the color-texture extracted at the local neighborhood of each pixel is utilized as the input to our classification algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The color-texture at each pixel is extracted by local Fourier transform (LFT) from a new color space, the most discriminant color space (MDC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MDC color space is optimized to be a linear combination of the original RGB color space so that the extracted LFT texture features in the MDC color space can achieve most discrimination in terms of classification (segmentation) performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To speed up the texture feature extraction process, we develop an efficient LFT extraction algorithm based on image shifting and image integral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the splitting part, given a connected component of the segmentation map, we initially differentiate whether it is a touching-cell clump or a single nontouching cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The differentiation is mainly based on the distance between the most likely radial-symmetry center and the geometrical center of the connected component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The boundaries of touching-cell clumps are smoothed out by Fourier shape descriptor before carrying out an iterative, concave-point and radial-symmetry based splitting algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To test the validity, effectiveness and efficiency of the framework, it is applied to follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> pathological images, which exhibit complex background and extracellular texture with nonuniform illumination condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For comparison purposes, the results of the proposed segmentation algorithm are evaluated against the outputs of superpixel, graph-cut, mean-shift, and two state-of-the-art pathological image segmentation methods using ground-truth that was established by manual segmentation of cells in the original images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our segmentation algorithm achieves better results than the other compared methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results of splitting are evaluated in terms of under-splitting, over-splitting, and encroachment errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>By summing up the three types of errors, we achieve a total error rate of 5.25% per image </plain></SENT>
