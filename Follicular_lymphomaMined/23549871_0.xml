<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 676 patients were randomized to five 5-week cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi>-rituximab or rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was PFS; this prespecified analysis of candidate protein biomarkers and genes was an exploratory objective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Archived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue and whole blood samples were collected at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and genetic analyses were completed for 4 proteins and 8 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In initial pairwise analyses, using individual single-nucleotide polymorphism genotypes, one biomarker pair (PSMB1 P11A C/G heterozygote, low CD68 expression) was associated with a significant PFS benefit with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi>-rituximab versus rituximab, controlling for multiple comparison corrections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pair was analyzed under dominant, recessive, and additive genetic models, with significant association with PFS seen under the dominant model (G/G+C/G) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients carrying this biomarker pair [PSMB1 P11A G allele, low CD68 expression (â‰¤50 CD68-positive cells), population frequency: 43.6%], median PFS was 14.2 months with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi>-rituximab versus 9.1 months with rituximab (HR 0.47, P &lt; 0.0001), and there was a significant overall survival benefit (HR 0.49, P = 0.0461) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Response rates were higher and time to next antilymphoma therapy was longer in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi>-rituximab group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In biomarker-negative patients, no significant efficacy differences were seen between treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similar proportions of patients had high-risk features in the biomarker-positive and biomarker-negative subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PSMB1 P11A (G allele) and low CD68 expression seemed to have significantly longer PFS and greater clinical benefit with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi>-rituximab versus rituximab </plain></SENT>
