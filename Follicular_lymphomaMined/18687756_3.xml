<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs) occur commonly in the lymph nodes, and duodenal FL (DFL) is reported to be rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analysed the clinical, morphological, immunohistochemical and genetic features of 26 cases of DFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary DFLs and systemic FLs that involved the duodenum at any point during the clinical course were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Typically, primary DFLs (14 cases) were found incidentally at routine medical check-ups, whereas involvement of the duodenum by systemic FLs (12 cases) was found through staging procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases involved the second portion of the duodenum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> was common (71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the histologic grade was low (either grade 1 or 2), and CD20, CD10 and Bcl-2 were positive by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGH) and bcl-2 gene (BCL2) fusion was frequently shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis: nine of 12 cases (75%) of primary DFL and 10 of 12 cases (83%) of systemic DFL were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment regimens employed were rituximab (R) plus chemotherapy (10), R (6), chemotherapy (3), irradiation (3) and the other three patients were subjected to observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up duration of 40 months (ranging 11-96 months), 17 patients were alive without disease, seven were alive with disease and one had died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Primary DFLs resemble systemic and nodal FLs, except that the former has high incidence of early stage and low-grade histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The duodenum appears to be a frequently involved extranodal site of FL with IGH/BCL2 </plain></SENT>
