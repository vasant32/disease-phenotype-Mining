<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were classified as having follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 12 diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The treatment schedule consisted of interferon alfa-2b 3 X 10(6) IU/m2 thrice-weekly and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> 10 mg daily for three weeks, with a week's rest between each cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment continued for upto six cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We obtained two complete remissions (CR), 12 good partial remissions (GPR), seven no remissions (NR) and one stable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On histologic examination we observed a response in 8 of 10 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (2 CR and 6 GPR); three of five patients with diffuse mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and three of seven patients with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed GPR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The major toxicity consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> and, in one case, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001254'>lethargy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one patient the treatment was stopped at the second cycle because of poor compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hematologic toxicity was generally mild and occurred between the third and fourth cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We observed hepatic toxicity i.e. a transient increase of transaminase levels, in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We consider this regimen to be effective in the treatment of relapsed or resistant NHL and no more toxic than single agent therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A randomized study to verify this therapeutic approach versus conventional therapy with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> alone in first-line treatment is recommended </plain></SENT>
