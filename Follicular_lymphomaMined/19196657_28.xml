<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the almost universal application of this therapy, however, its exact mechanism of action has not been completely defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One proposed mechanism is that of a "vaccinal" effect, whereby FL cell kill by rituximab results in the elicitation of an FL-specific T-cell response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The demonstration that rituximab can even elicit such a response in patients has, to our knowledge, never been shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the response against the immunoglobulin expressed by the FL before and after rituximab monotherapy in 5 FL patients and found an increase in FL idiotype-specific T cells after rituximab in 4 of 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data thus provide "proof of principle" for the ability of passive immunotherapy with rituximab to elicit an active FL-specific cellular response </plain></SENT>
