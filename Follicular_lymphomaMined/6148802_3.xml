<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Reactive and neoplastic follicles in lymph nodes showing changes of (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> and (2) follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were examined for the presence of dendritic reticulum cells (DRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cells could be identified under the light microscope after comparing electron microscopical sections with subsequent 1 micro sections of reactive germinal centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantitative light microscopical evaluation showed that DRC, both mononuclear and binuclear forms, were less numerous in neoplastic follicular structures than in reactive follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before determining the frequency of binucleated DRC in follicular tissue their <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was studied first in cell suspensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DRC isolated by enzymatic treatment of tonsils and reactive lymph nodes were morphologically identical and contained one, or at most two, nuclei arranged in a typical doublet formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stereological calculations - made on three dimensional models of nuclear complexes prepared from serial tissue sections - indicated that 51 to 68% of DRC in reactive germinal centres were binucleated, whereas in neoplastic follicles this figure is 18 to 23% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The multinucleated giant cell forms of DRC described by others result from complex formation with other DRC or lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The smaller number of DRC and the lower frequency of binucleated DRC in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> suggest that differentiation of DRC from stromal cells is less complete in these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ability to identify DRC reliably by light microscopy offers a new means to define the difference in frequency of DRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may be of practical value in distinguishing reactive germinal centres from neoplastic follicles </plain></SENT>
