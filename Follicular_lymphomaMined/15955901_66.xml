<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients with recurrent B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> received anti-CD22 epratuzumab 360 mg/m(2) and anti-CD20 rituximab 375 mg/m(2) monoclonal antibodies weekly for four doses each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients had indolent histologies (15 with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) and seven had aggressive NHL (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indolent patients had received a median of one (range, one to six) prior treatment, with 31% refractory to their last therapy and 81% with high-risk Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> had a median of three (range, one to eight) prior regimens (14% resistant to last treatment) and 71% had high intermediate-risk or high-risk International Prognostic Index scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were rituximab na√Øve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment was well tolerated, with toxicities principally infusion-related and predominantly grade 1 or 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten (67%) patients with follicular NHL achieved an objective response (OR), including nine of 15 (60%) with complete responses (CRs and unconfirmed CRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four of six assessable patients (67%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> achieved an OR, including three (50%) CRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median time to progression for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> indolent NHL patients was 17.8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The full-dose combination of epratuzumab with rituximab was well tolerated and had significant clinical activity in NHL, suggesting that this combination should be tested in comparison with single-agent treatment </plain></SENT>
