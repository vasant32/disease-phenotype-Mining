<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several publications have highlighted the importance of molecular follow-up in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, demonstrating that the detection of cells bearing the BclII-IgH rearrangement by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) can anticipate a clinical relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this context, we developed a BclII-IgH RQ-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We began with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51461">SYBR Green I</z:chebi> detection technology but observed that this system does not allow an accurate measurement of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> load when working with genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While we were designing the assay using Taqman technology, Moppett et al (Moppett J, van der Velden VHJ, Wijkhuijs AJM, Hancock J, van Dongen JJM, Goulden N: Inhibition affecting RQ-PCR-based assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>: reversal by addition of bovine serum albumin </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They demonstrated that this PCR inhibition could be partially resolved by adding nonacetylated bovine serum albumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In our studies, we observed the same phenomenon in a single follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> case and extended our study to other available cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As a result, we suggest a new RQ-PCR procedure that is based on Taqman probe technology and that takes into account the PCR inhibition problems, making this assay more reliable in a routine molecular laboratory </plain></SENT>
