<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to validate the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) in a population-based cohort and to study the relevance of revision and extension of the FLIPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data of 353 unselected patients, 1993-2002, in the Eindhoven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry, were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was completed up to 1 January 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple imputations for missing covariates were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Validity was assessed by comparing observed to predicted survival of the original model and of a revised model with other prognostic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The original FLIPI stratified our cohort into three different risk groups based on stage, Hb, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase, nodal involvement and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The discrimination between risk groups was not as good as in the original cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A model including age in three categories (&lt; or =60/61-70/&gt;70 years) and presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) (yes/no) resulted in a better prognostic index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall survival rates were 79%, 59% and 28% in the low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups for the extended FLIPI compared with 81%, 66% and 47% for the original FLIPI, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The performance of the FLIPI was validated in a population-based setting, but could significantly be improved by a more refined coding of age and by including the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
