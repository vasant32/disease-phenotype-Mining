<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Occasionally it is the only organ infiltrated, and therefore a bone marrow biopsy is the prime diagnostic choice in cases of leukemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A synoptical diagnostic approach relying on immunophenotypic as well as on molecular biological criteria aside from histomorphology (cytomorphology), is of utmost importance for the subtyping of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This too can be done reliably on bone marrow biopsies, as comparative studies have yielded a concordance rate of more than 90% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> typing on corresponding lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytology and the pattern of infiltrates, (i.e. diffuse, interstitial, nodular peritrabecular and intrasinusoidal), in combination with immunological phenotyping are the mainstays for subtyping, giving clear-cut decisions in most cases of small B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mantle zone as well as marginal cell and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the blastic variants the most important are the lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of either B- or T-cell type which have to be discerned from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and the so-called blastoid mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are rare compared to B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the rarely seen T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of large granular lymphocytes is the dominating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which in most cases can only be diagnosed reliably by molecular biological means, followed by T-CLL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036920" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Sezary's syndrome</z:e> and hepatosplenic chi delta <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
