<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, a simple reliable method to quantify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) would improve prognostication in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fluorescent hybridization probes have been used in real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) to monitor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> with a reproducible sensitivity of 0.01%; however, these techniques are expensive and require additional experiments to examine clonality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51461">SYBR Green I</z:chebi> detection method that is more universal, checks clonal identity, yields the same sensitivity for monitoring <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>, and is more economically attractive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using this method to follow 14 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients treated with autologous stem cell transplantation, molecular markers were successfully defined for 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median contamination of stem-cell grafts was 0.1% (range, 0 to 13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients with measurable graft contamination became PCR-negative in blood and bone marrow within 12 months after autologous stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients free of disease progression (median follow-up of 75 months) are in molecular remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increasing fractions of RQ-PCR-positive blood and bone marrow cells reliably predicted morphological and clinical relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one case, both clinical relapse and spontaneous regression were reflected by changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, our RQ-PCR method reproducibly distinguishes different levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
