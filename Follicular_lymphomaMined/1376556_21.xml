<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The gastrointestinal tract is the most common site for extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, but follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> involving the gut are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study their pathologic features and bcl-2 expression, 31 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the GI tract were reviewed and unstained paraffin sections from 24 of the cases were immunohistochemically stained using a monoclonal antibody for the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> product of the proto-oncogene bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most common site of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involvement was the small intestine, especially the terminal ileum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> tended to present clinically with symptomatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> and small intestinal lesions presented with obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five cases involving the terminal ileum or colon had a gross appearance of multitudinous mucosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and were considered to represent examples of "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334638" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">multiple lymphomatous polyposis</z:e>." Enhanced expression of the bcl-2 oncogenic protein was detectable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in 75% of cases and at lower levels in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid cells in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Small cleaved or mixed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were more likely to show enhanced expression than were large cell cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reactive germinal centers showed no bcl-2 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that follicular GI <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are associated with distinctive pathological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In their tendency to express bcl-2, these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> resemble their lymph node-based counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining for enhanced bcl-2 expression is of potential diagnostic utility in distinguishing between follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> in the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The relevance of the results to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) is discussed </plain></SENT>
