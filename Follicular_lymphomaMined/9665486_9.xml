<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The 150-kd transmembrane protein CD100 is the first semaphorin protein shown to be expressed in lymphoid tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD100 is present in the interfollicular T cell zones and is also expressed by B cells in the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid follicles, but not in the mantle zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CD100 molecule was recently cloned, and CD100 transfectants were shown to induce homotypic aggregation of human B cells and improve their viability in vitro, suggesting that CD100 may play a role in lymphocyte aggregation and germinal center formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the expression of CD100 in 138 clinical cases representing a range of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, to determine whether this molecule is expressed in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027671" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic processes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In general, we found CD100 expression to be common in peripheral T-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> but rare in B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD100 expression was not detectable in low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including cases of small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (18 cases), marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (10 cases), and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (10 cases), as might be expected for these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> that are not of follicular center cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, we found that the vast majority of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (37 of 40 cases) as well as diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of B-cell type (35 cases) did not express CD100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neoplastic cells in 3 of 11 cases of predominantly large-cell-type follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> did express CD100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five cases of high-grade, small non-cleaved (Burkitt-like) B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were immunoreactive for CD100 expression, as were 18 of 20 cases (90%) of malignant T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis of CD100 expression correlated with immunohistochemical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Absence of expression of CD100 by neoplastic follicular center B cells is a common feature in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, but expression of CD100 by T cells is maintained in T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
