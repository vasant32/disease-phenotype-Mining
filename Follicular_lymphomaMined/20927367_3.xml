<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is a form of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) that arises from germinal center (GC) B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the significant advances in immunotherapy, FL is still not curable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Beyond transcriptional profiling and genomics datasets, there currently is no epigenome-scale dataset or integrative biology approach that can adequately model this disease and therefore identify novel mechanisms and targets for successful prevention and treatment of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed methylation-enriched genome-wide <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing of FL cells and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD19(+) B-cells using 454 sequencing technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The methylated DNA fragments were enriched with <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-binding proteins, treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi>, and sequenced using the Roche-454 GS FLX sequencer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total number of bases covered in the human genome was 18.2 and 49.3 million including 726,003 and 1.3 million CpGs in FL and CD19(+) B-cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>11,971 and 7,882 methylated regions of interest (MRIs) were identified respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The genome-wide distribution of these MRIs displayed significant differences between FL and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A reverse trend in the distribution of MRIs between the promoter and the gene body was observed in FL and CD19(+) B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The MRIs identified in FL cells also correlated well with transcriptomic data and ChIP-on-Chip analyses of genome-wide <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modifications such as tri-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-H3K27, and tri-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-H3K4, indicating a concerted epigenetic alteration in FL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study is the first to provide a large scale and comprehensive analysis of the DNA methylation sequence composition and distribution in the FL epigenome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These integrated approaches have led to the discovery of novel and frequent targets of aberrant epigenetic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The genome-wide <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing approach developed here can be a useful tool for profiling DNA methylation in clinical samples </plain></SENT>
