<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further evaluate this possibility, we examined hair dye use and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> risk in a case-control study in the Thai population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 390 histologically confirmed incident non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) cases and 422 controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information on hair dye use was obtained through a personal interview together with information on other known risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis was performed using logistic regression; odds ratios (ORs) estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ever use of hair dyes was not associated with an increase risk of NHL both overall (OR=1.1, 95%CI 0.8-1.5) and in women (OR=1.4, 95%CI 0.9-2.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, NHL was significantly higher among persons who began using hair dyes before 1980 (OR=2.1, 95%CI 1.0-4.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An increased risk was also observed among women who reported use of permanent hair dye product (OR=1.8, 95% CI 1.0-3.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analyses by NHL subtype showed an increased risk for diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> among users of permanent hair dyes (OR=1.6, 95%CI 1.0-2.5) while follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was associated with the use of dark-colored dyes (OR=3.7, 95%CI 1.1-12.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No association was observed with duration of use, nor total lifetime applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that personal hair dye use may play role in risks of NHL among person who used hair dyes before 1980 </plain></SENT>
