<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Samples from 24/44 patients were found to be positive for translocations involving the major breakpoint region of the BCL2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In samples from seven patients two distinct t(14;18) translocations were shown to be present simultaneously; in one case the second translocation involved the minor cluster region of the BCL2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biopsy tissue obtained earlier in the course of the disease was available from five of these patients and was shown to contain one of the translocations in each case, but both translocations in only one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further remission blood and bone marrow samples from the group were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This led to the detection of both translocations in separate samples obtained at different times in a total of four out of the seven cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two of the remaining three patients the second translocation could not be amplified from further samples, but in both cases the search led to the identification of a third translocation, again only detectable in a single sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that JH/BCL2 translocations can occur more than once during the course of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They suggest that biclonal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> may be more common than has previously been recognized but also raise the possibility that the translocation arises sporadically in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid cells of this group of patients </plain></SENT>
