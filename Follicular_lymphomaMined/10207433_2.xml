<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficiency of axial computed tomography (CT) in detecting relapses of stage I, II, or III follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 328 patients with previously untreated stage I, II, or III follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were treated between 1978 and 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two hundred fifty-seven patients achieved complete response; 78 who relapsed form the basis of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients had stage I; 28, stage II; and 35, stage III disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients underwent radiation therapy; 12, chemotherapy; and 51, radiation and chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Medical records were reviewed to analyze the yield of abdominal and pelvic CT in detecting recurrence relative to the yield of standard clinical, hematologic, and imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A positive study was defined as one that led to or was abnormal at the diagnosis of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median follow-up was 101 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eleven relapses were detected only at abdominal, pelvic, or both abdominal and pelvic CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Fourteen percent (11 of 78) of the relapses were detected solely at abdominal and/or pelvic CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven (4.3%) of the 257 patients who achieved complete response benefited from abdominal and pelvic CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The yield of the routine use of abdominal and pelvic CT in follow-up studies appears to be low for stages I-III follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
