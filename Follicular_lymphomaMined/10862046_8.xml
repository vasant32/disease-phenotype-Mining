<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (MZBL), arising at different nodal and extranodal sites, are poorly characterized on the genetic level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed cytogenetic investigations in 20 splenic and in 10 nodal MZBL and analyzed 52 MZBL (including 12 MALT-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) for deletions of TP53, D13S25, and RB1 loci by fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A new nonrandom chromosomal aberration, del(10)(q22q24), was found as a clonal anomaly in 3 out of 20 cases of splenic MZBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further recurring abnormalities such as del(7q) or <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 3 were found to be characteristic chromosomal changes in a subset of splenic MZBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TP53 was deleted in 5/25 cases of splenic MZBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deletions involving band 13q14 were only rarely encountered, challenging a previous report that stated a dissociated D13S25-RB1 status as characteristic in splenic MZBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There are fundamental differences between the different subtypes of marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> as defined with current classification schemes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Splenic MZBL, in contrast to most other entities of B-cell NHL, seems to constitute a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disease especially with regard to genetic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>del(10)(q22q24) could be of importance at least in a subset of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> entity </plain></SENT>
