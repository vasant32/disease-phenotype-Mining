<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques can also detect t(14;18)-sequences in the blood and lymphoid tissues of healthy individuals (HI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the immunophenotypic markers of t(14;18)-positive cells in HI and to relate these features to lymphocyte maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>B cells from 10 subjects with t(14;18)-positive and three subjects with t(14;18)-negative peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were fluorescence-activated cell sorted for antigen-naïve (CD27(-)), immunoglobulin M (IgM) memory (IgM(+)CD27(+)) and switched memory (IgM(-) CD27(+)) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>t(14;18)-recombinations were detected by quantitative PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among PBMC-positive subjects, t(14;18)-frequency was significantly higher in IgM memory (median: 380/10(6)) than in antigen-naïve (median: 16/10(6)) or switched memory (median: 5/10(6)) B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> PBMC-negative subjects nevertheless had detectable t(14;18) in sorted B cells; levels were lower than in PBMC-positive subjects, but had the same relative predominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that t(14;18) is generated during early B-cell development in the bone marrow and that affected cells may mature and expand in germinal centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>t(14;18)-frequency was highest in IgM memory cells, a B-cell subset that shares immunophenotypic similarities with FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The significance of these cells as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> precursors or indicators of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> risk remains to be established </plain></SENT>
