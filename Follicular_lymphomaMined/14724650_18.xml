<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to analyze the amount of bcl-2 protein expressed along <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human B-cell maturation and to establish the frequency of aberrant bcl-2 expression in B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow (n=11), bcl-2 expression obtained by quantitative multiparametric flow cytometry was highly variable: very low in both CD34(+) and CD34(-) B-cell precursors, high in mature B-lymphocytes and very high in plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 expression of mature B-lymphocytes from peripheral blood (n=10), spleen (n=8) and lymph node (n=5) was significantly higher (P&lt;0.02) in CD23(-) as compared to CD23(+) B cells, independent of the type of tissue analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Upon comparison with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human B-cell maturation, bcl-2 expression in neoplastic B cells from 144 patients was found to be aberrant in 66% of the cases, usually corresponding to bcl-2 overexpression (63%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) carrying t(14;18) and MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were the only diagnostic groups constantly showing overexpression of bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 overexpression was also frequently found in precursor B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (84%), typical (77%) and atypical (75%) B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, prolymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (two of three cases), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (55%), but not in t(14;18)(-) FL, splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
