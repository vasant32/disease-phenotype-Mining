<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two single case reports documenting IDCS harboring t(14;18) translocation involving immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) and BCL2 have been reported recently; however, one of the 2 IDCS has a synchronous follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the absence or presence of a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the remaining case is not mentioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, by using polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization techniques, we have showed that there is neither t(14;18)/IGH-BCL2 nor IGH gene rearrangement in 4 de novo IDCS without a concurrent or known history of a B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, including follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, indicating that BCL2 chromosomal translocation is not a general feature of de novo IDCS </plain></SENT>
