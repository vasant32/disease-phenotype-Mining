<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that hypermutability is necessary to account for the high frequency of mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, historically, the mutation rate (mu) has been difficult to measure directly, and increased cell turnover or selection could provide an alternative explanation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently developed an assay for mu using PIG-A as a sentinel gene and estimated that its average value is 10.6 x 10(-7) mutations per cell division in B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (BLCLs) from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we have measured mu in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and found that it was elevated in cell lines derived from T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in transformed phase, and 2 plasma cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, mu was much lower in a marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line and 5 other plasma cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The highest mu value that we measured, 3286 x 10(-7), is 2 orders of magnitude above the range we have observed in non-malignant human cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the type of genomic instability detected in this assay is a common but not universal feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
