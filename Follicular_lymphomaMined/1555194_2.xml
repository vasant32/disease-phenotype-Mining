<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten cases showed cytogenetic alterations with different markers, including a 14q+ in eight: in four it was the result of a t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis by Southern blotting with bcl2 probes from major and minor cluster regions, and PCR with primers from major and minor regions showed differences versus the cytogenetic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlation found between cytogenetic and molecular results suggests other factors, such as geographical differences or different pathogenetic mechanisms, more than methodologic aspects, to explain the different frequencies of this marker among countries </plain></SENT>
