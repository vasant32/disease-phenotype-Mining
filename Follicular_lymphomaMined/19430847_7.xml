<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pre-treatment 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4167">D-glucose</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography-computed tomography scans of 23 patients with pathologic diagnosis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were retrospectively analyzed together with Ki67 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The maximal standardized uptake value (SUV) was measured and corrected to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level of 100 mg/dl over the biopsy region (BxSUV100) and at the highest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> activity of the body (BmSUV100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BxSUV100 was significantly correlated with Ki67 (p = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was an increasing trend of metabolic activity across the pathologic grades of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BmSUV100 and BxSUV100 were also significantly different (p &lt; 0.0005), suggesting potential pitfalls of sampling error by histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The increasing trend of metabolic activity across follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grades correlates with cellular proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The metabolic information from <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography-computed tomography may offer another useful parameter in the management of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
