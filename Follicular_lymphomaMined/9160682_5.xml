<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is characterized in a significant proportion of cases by the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation, which results in the juxtaposition of the oncogene bcl-2 to the joining region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular sequence analysis indicates that the t(14;18) rearrangement occurs in a B-lymphoid progenitor cell at the time of IgH rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We were interested whether hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells as characterized by CD34 expression bear the translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow (BM)-CD34+ cells were enriched from 14 patients with FL whose BM was known to be positive for bcl-2/IgH (major breakpoint region [MBR]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients were in complete remission (CR), two patients were in partial remission (PR), and six patients had active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients had histological BM involvement when the samples were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using an immunomagnetic selection device (MINI-MACS), a mean purity of 88.7% +/- 4% CD34+ cells was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CD34+ cells were further enriched by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) using CD34 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>)- and CD19 phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The IgH gene was rearranged in the CD34+/CD19+ cell subset of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This population is thought to represent the progenitor stage at which the bcl-2/IgH translocation occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The unseparated BM mononuclear cell fraction from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 patients was positive for bcl-2/IgH using a nested PCR, but the BM-CD34+ cell fraction and the respective CD34+/CD19+ subset were negative in 13 of these 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The one patient with a positive PCR signal in the CD34+ cell subset had a relapse with BM involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that CD34+ progenitor cells including CD34+/CD19+ B-cell progenitors are not involved in the malignant cell clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data are in agreement with a transgenic mouse model, which indicates that the malignant phenotype in FL is sustained by mature B cells </plain></SENT>
