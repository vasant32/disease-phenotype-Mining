<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten phase III studies evaluating the role of IFN-alpha2 in 1,922 newly diagnosed patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Updated individual patient data were used to perform meta-analyses for response, survival, and remission duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The addition of IFN-alpha2 to initial chemotherapy did not significantly influence response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An overall meta-analysis for survival showed a significant difference in favor of IFN-alpha2, but also showed significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further analyses were carried out in order to explain this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, and to define the circumstances in which IFN-alpha2 prolonged survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The survival advantage was seen when IFN-alpha2 was given: (1) in conjunction with relatively intensive initial chemotherapy (2P = .00005), (2) at a dose &gt;/= 5 million units (2P = .000002), (3) at a cumulative dose &gt;/= 36 million units per month (2P = .000008), and (4) with chemotherapy rather than as maintenance therapy (P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With regard to remission duration, there was also a significant difference in favor of IFN-alpha2, irrespective of the intensity of chemotherapy used, IFN dose, or whether IFN was given as a maintenance strategy or with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: When given in the context of relatively intensive initial chemotherapy, and at a dose &gt;/= 5 million units (&gt;/= 36 x 10(6) units per month), IFN-alpha2 prolongs survival and remission duration in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
