<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Screening Trial was used to evaluate risk of NHL and its subtypes in association with anthropometric factors, smoking, and alcohol consumption in a prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle was assessed via questionnaire among 142,982 male and female participants aged 55-74 years enrolled in the PLCO Trial during 1993-2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During 1,201,074 person-years of follow-up through 2006, 1,264 histologically confirmed NHL cases were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher body mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height (m)(2)) at ages 20 and 50 years and at baseline was associated with increased NHL risk (P(trend) &lt; 0.01 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>; e.g., for baseline BMI &gt; or =30 vs. 18.5-24.9, hazard ratio = 1.32, 95% confidence interval: 1.13, 1.54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Smoking was not associated with NHL overall but was inversely associated with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ever smoking vs. never: hazard ratio = 0.62, 95% confidence interval: 0.45, 0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alcohol consumption was unrelated to NHL (drinks/week: P(trend) = 0.187) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data support previous studies suggesting that BMI is positively associated with NHL, show an inverse association between smoking and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (perhaps due to residual confounding), and do not support a causal association between alcohol and NHL </plain></SENT>
