<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody to the surface antigen CD20 and has provided better outcomes against CD20+ B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> than chemotherapy with conventional antitumor drugs alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment with rituximab poses a considerable problem, however, because of CD20- <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> transformation and subsequent disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have established a CD20- <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, RRBL1, from a diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with CD20- transformation from CD20+ follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> after treatment with rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RRBL1 was CD10+, CD19+, and CD20- by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD20 expression was not detected by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting with whole RRBL1 cell lysate showed a very faint CD20 band only with longer exposures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The level of CD20 <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) expression detected by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis was almost 100 times lower than that in CD20+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When we treated RRBL1 cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46024">trichostatin A</z:chebi>, an epigenetic drug that modulates <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi>-acetylation status, we detected dramatically increased CD20 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms may explain the CD20- phenotype in RRBL1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, RRBL1 may be useful not only for analyses of mechanisms for the absence of CD20 expression in vitro but also for exploration of therapies against CD20- B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
