<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the incidence and predictive factors for development of transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in a population-based series of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Database was used to identify patients with FL diagnosed and treated in the province of British Columbia, Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was defined as the development of aggressive non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) in patients with FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Factors present at the time of initial diagnosis of indolent NHL and at transformation were analyzed for their impact on risk of transformation and subsequent outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 1986 and 2001, 600 patients with newly diagnosed FL met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 109 months (range, 10 to 244), 170 (28%) developed transformation, 107 (63%) based on biopsy confirmation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The annual risk of transformation was 3% continuously through 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis of clinical factors at diagnosis identified advanced stage as the only predictor of future transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median post-transformation survival was 1.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival was superior for patients with limited extent transformation compared with those with advanced cases (66% v 19%, P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with transformation based on clinical versus histological criteria had an identical median survival of 1.8 years (P = .2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The annual risk of transformation of FL is 3% continuing without plateau beyond 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Advanced stage at diagnosis is predictive of future transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Clinically diagnosed transformation has an equal impact on outcome as biopsy proven transformation </plain></SENT>
