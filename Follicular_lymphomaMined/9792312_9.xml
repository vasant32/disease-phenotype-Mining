<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four were male and their age ranged from 4.25 to 13.5 years (median 7.5); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e>, Murphy's stage I (n = 4) and II (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sites involved at presentation were cervical lymph nodes and tonsils (n = 5), ileum (n = 1) and parotid gland (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three had complete surgical excision only and four had complete (n = 1) or incomplete excision (n= 3) followed by a short multi-agent chemotherapy regimen (UKCCSG 9001 protocol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 1.5 years (range 0.25-5 years) from diagnosis, six are alive in complete remission (CR) including three who had no chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results confirm previous reports that follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in children are rare (1.5%) and tend to be localized at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their rarity makes it difficult to produce guidelines about treatment, but in localized cases a period of non-intervention may be justified </plain></SENT>
