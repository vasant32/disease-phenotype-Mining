<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Randomized trials analyzing the impact of RM compared to observation alone have demonstrated a significantly better outcome in terms of progression-free survival (but not overall survival) in patients (pts) who received as first-line treatment single-agent rituximab, standard chemotherapy (CVP) and recently also immunochemotherapy (R-CHOP, R-CVP or R-FND), as shown by preliminary results of the PRIMA trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also in the setting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relapsed disease</z:e>, RM has shown significant benefit either after chemotherapy or immunochemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RM has been generally well tolerated, and treated pts developed only mild toxicity, mainly a small increased rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086438" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypogammaglobulinaemia</z:e> and self-limiting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002788'>upper-respiratory tract infections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, no cumulative or unexpected toxicities were observed and quality of life was not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data have established RM therapy as an important part of multi-modal therapeutic strategies in patients affected by FL </plain></SENT>
