<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were selectively isolated by laser microdissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BCL-XL expression from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissue and microdissected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells was measured by using real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BCL-XL mutation was analyzed by using direct sequencing of PCR products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that compared to 15 patients with reactive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, BCL-XL was overexpressed in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 30), both in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissue (P = 0.0064) and in microdissected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant rise of BCL-XL expression was observed in patients with T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 24) and diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, high BCL-XL level was associated with multiple extranodal involvement (P = 0.0004), <z:mp ids='MP_0002944'>elevated lactate dehydrogenase level</z:mp> (P = 0.0019), high-risk international prognostic index (P = 0.0013) and a short overall survival time (P = 0.0451) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis revealed one synonymous mutation (Codon 109 ACA--&gt;ACC) in one case of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that BCL-XL expression is closely correlated with progress of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and prognosis of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The value of BCL-XL expression as a prognostic marker in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> should be considered </plain></SENT>
