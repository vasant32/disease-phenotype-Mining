<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the architectural pattern in these cases suggested B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the cytologic features suggested a T-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunologic studies of frozen sections by immunohistochemical techniques in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases, as well as cell suspension studies in two cases, showed that the follicular center cells, including those with convoluted and cerebriform nuclei, were clearly monoclonal B cells, as evidenced by the presence of only one immunoglobulin light chain on the surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest that the follicular architectural pattern is a more reliable predictor of the immunologic phenotype than are the cytologic features </plain></SENT>
