<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A main function attributed to the BCL2 protein is its ability to confer resistance against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to the constitutively high expression of BCL2, caused by gene rearrangement in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, elevated expression of the BCL2 gene has been found in differentiating hematopoietic, neural, and epithelial tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address the question of whether the expression of BCL2 is a cause or consequence of cell differentiation, we used a human neural-crest-derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell line, Paju, that undergoes spontaneous neural differentiation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Paju cell line displays moderate expression of BCL2, the level of which increases in parallel with further neural differentiation induced by treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> 12-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> 13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transfection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human BCL2 cDNA in sense and antisense orientations had a dramatic impact on the differentiation of the Paju cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of BCL2 cDNA induced extensive neurite outgrowth, even in low serum concentrations, together with an increased expression of neuron-specific enolase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Paju cells expressing the anti-sense BCL2 cDNA construct, which reduced the endogenous levels of BCL2, did not undergo spontaneous neural differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These cells acquired an epithelioid <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and up-regulated the intermediate filament protein nestin, typically present in primitive neuroectodermal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The manipulated levels of BCL2 did not have appreciable impact on cell survival in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate that the BCL2 gene product participates in the regulation of neural differentiation </plain></SENT>
