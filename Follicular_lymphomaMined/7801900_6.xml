<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors analyzed the frequency of immunophenotypic abnormalities in 1,474 cases of routinely fixed, paraffin-embedded B-lineage non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>B-lineage was determined by immunoreactivity for CD20 (L26, 92%); CD45RA (4KB5, an additional 3%) or immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain restriction (remaining 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD45RA was found to be especially helpful on Bouin's-fixed or decalcified tissue and Ig staining was most helpful in plasmacytoid lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coexpression of the T-cell marker CD43 (Leu-22) was the most common immunophenotypic abnormality, seen in 60% of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>), 39% of CLL/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 16% of diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DLCL), but only 5% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to CD45RO (A6 and UCHL1) and CD3 (polyclonal) were useful in distinguishing infiltrating T cells from B cells coexpressing CD43 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ig light chain restriction was the next commonest immunophenotypic abnormality, which was identified in 67% of plasmacytoid diffuse small cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 43% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCLs</z:e>, 35% of monocytoid B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 28% of FLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of bcl-2 oncogenic protein was observed in 71% of FLs (n = 96), but not in a control group of reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasias</z:hpo> (n = 34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combining two criteria increased the sensitivity of immunodiagnosis in certain circumstances </plain></SENT>
