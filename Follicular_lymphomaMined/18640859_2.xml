<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The IGKV1-39/1D-39 gene predominated and was significantly over-represented compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells, autoreactive cells or other B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The impact of somatic hypermutation varied significantly; nevertheless, mutation distribution patterns indicated pressure for preservation of the B cell receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present series demonstrates biased usage of IGKV genes in FL and alludes to the important role of immunoglobulin kappa light chains in antigen selection of the clonogenic B cells in FL </plain></SENT>
