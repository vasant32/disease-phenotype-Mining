<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and twenty-six cases of FL and 31 cases of reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> (RFH) were studied with routine microscopy and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Loss of CD10 expression was observed in 37 cases (29.4%) of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patterns of CD10 loss were demonstrated, as follows: diffuse CD10 loss in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the neoplastic follicles (33/37, 89%), CD10 loss in most follicles (3/37, 8%) and CD10 loss in only a few follicles (1/37, 3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In general, loss of CD10 was frequently seen in higher-grade FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Morphologically, the cases with CD10 loss showed follicular architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neoplastic follicles in high-grade FL were of various sizes and showed irregular margins, while those in low-grade FL were relatively uniform in size with regular margin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sometimes, the CD10-negative FL cells contained a clear cytoplasm, mimicking monocytoid B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, CD10 expression was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the 31 cases of RFH studied, with the exception of occasional individual or regressed follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The expression of CD10 differs in FL and RFH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Loss of CD10 expression is seen mainly in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is thus considered as a valuable parameter in differentiating between FL and RFH </plain></SENT>
