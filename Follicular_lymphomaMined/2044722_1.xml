<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several reports suggested that they are incurable by conventional chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>10 patients with follicular NHL were autografted for consolidation of early remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of these patients treated in 1979 received the TACC regimen with unpurged marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other 9 (8 in first, 1 in second remission) treated since July 1987 received the BEAM regimen followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) with marrow purged in vitro by mafosfamide at levels individually adjusted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>8 patients remain in unmaintained CR 15 to 43 months post-ABMT-2 are beyond 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient autografted in 1979 has relapsed 9 yr later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ABMT is feasible with no indue toxicity for consolidation of follicular NHL early in first remission, as an alternative aggressive strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies and a longer follow-up will be needed to evaluate its antitumor efficacy </plain></SENT>
