<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As demonstrated for hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, bone marrow trephine biopsy specimen immunostaining (BMT/IS) can successfully detect residual malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to use BMT/IS and computerized image analysis (CIMA) of bcl-2-positive cells to quantify RD in B-CLL patients in CR, after achievement of CR and more than 1 year later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This methodology was compared with other conventional techniques, i.e., cytologic, flow cytometric, cytogenetic, and molecular analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BMT/IS readily detected RD in every trephine biopsy specimen examined, either after CR or at distant follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CIMA allowed an objective quantification of residual B-CLL cells, as evidenced by the correlation with semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both analyses indicated a progression of RD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding was also supported (but inconsistently) by the other techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CIMA with an interstitial labeling index, therefore, seems to be a reproducible and sensitive method to detect persistence and progression of RD in patients with B-CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This method could apply to other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> infiltrating the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
