<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To describe current clinical practices in Australia, by surveying haematologists, oncologists and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diseases</z:e> physicians involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinician members from Australian professional associations, accounting for the vast majority of Australian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> specialists, were invited to participate in an electronic survey, comprising of a clinical case-based questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical practice areas explored were: use of risk-assessment and empiric antibiotic strategies across various treatment settings; use of anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> prophylaxis; and use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors for established neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and for secondary prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 252 clinicians returned responses (approximately 30% response rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority (&gt;70%) were representative of practices in public, major city, tertiary referral hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Less than half of clinicians were aware of risk-assessment tools and less than quarter currently used ambulatory care strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If adequate resources were made available, more than 80% were willing to use risk-assessment tools and 60% more clinicians were likely to use ambulatory care strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most clinicians prescribed dual therapy parenteral antibiotics, even for clinically stable patients (53% haematologists, 56% oncologists) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor was used frequently as secondary prophylaxis in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> case (91%), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> case (59%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small cell lung cancer</z:e> case (31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fluoroquinolone prophylaxis was infrequently prescribed (19% oncologists, 30% haematologists) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-practice gaps were identified around the use of risk-assessment-based empiric therapy, and help to inform better clinical guidance </plain></SENT>
