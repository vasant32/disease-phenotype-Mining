<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vgamma9Vdelta2 T lymphocytes are regarded as promising mediators of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> immunotherapy due to their capacity to eliminate multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027659" disease_type="Neoplastic Process;Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">experimental tumors</z:e>, particularly within those of hematopoietic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, Vgamma9Vdelta2 T-cell based <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> clinical trials have suffered from the lack of biomarkers that can be used as prognostic of therapeutic success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We have conducted a comprehensive study of gene expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo> and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, aimed at identifying markers of susceptibility versus resistance to Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell-mediated cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We employed cDNA microarrays and quantitative real-time PCR to screen 20 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, and 23 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic tumor</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data were analyzed using state-of-the-art bioinformatics, and gene expression patterns were correlated with susceptibility to Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell mediated cytolysis in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified a panel of 10 genes encoding cell surface proteins that were statistically differentially expressed between "gammadelta-susceptible" and "gammadelta-resistant" <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within this panel, 3 genes (ULBP1, TFR2 and IFITM1) were associated with increased susceptibility to Vgamma9Vdelta2 T-cell cytotoxicity, whereas the other 7 (CLEC2D, NRP2, SELL, PKD2, KCNK12, ITGA6 and SLAMF1) were enriched in resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, some of these candidates displayed a striking variance of expression among primary follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006727'>T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic tumors</z:e> display a highly variable repertoire of surface proteins that can impact on Vgamma9Vdelta2 cell-mediated immunotargeting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prognostic value of the proposed markers can now be evaluated in upcoming Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell-based <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> clinical trials </plain></SENT>
