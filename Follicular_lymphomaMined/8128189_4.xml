<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Variable immunoglobulin heavy-chain regions (VDJ) of two newly established human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines (HF-1 and HF-4) were sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most homologous germline VH gene found for both the HF-1 and HF-4 sequences was VH26 of the VH3a (V gene) family (82% and 91% homologies, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The JH region of the HF-4 heavy-chain sequence contained two nucleotide differences compared to the published germline JH3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The DHJH region of the HF-1 gene had a record high number (20%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The numerous hypermutations found in the HF-1 cell line support the hypothesis that in some human follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, mutations continue to accumulate in immunoglobulin genes during the malignant growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, which have an active mutational machinery, in future may help to solve the molecular events behind the somatic hypermutations modifying immunoglobulin genes of B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
