<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The quantity of immunoglobulin on the lymphocyte surface was estimated from the intensity of fluorescent staining with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>-conjugated anti-immunoglobulin antisera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At least two, and probably three, B cell species could be recognized by cell surface study </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> probably represented a third B-cell subtype with intermediate amounts of surface immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
