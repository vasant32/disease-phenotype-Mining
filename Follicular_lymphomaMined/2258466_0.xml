<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histologically, numerous neoplastic follicular structures were observed in the lymph nodes and spleen of both cases and in the tonsils and Peyer's patches of one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neoplastic cells infiltrated diffusely into the liver, lungs and heart in both cases and into the tonsils, kidneys, abomasum and bone marrow in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracytoplasmic immunoglobulin was negative in the neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follicular dendritic reticulum cells were decreased in number in the neoplastic follicles compared with those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid follicles </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histological features of the present cases are distinguishable from the adult form of bovine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the calf form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
