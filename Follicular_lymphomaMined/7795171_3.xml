<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have shown that the ability of the human follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell line SU-DHL-6 to proliferate and survive in vitro depends on both Bcl-2 expression and multiple autocrine growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment with Bcl-2 antisense (AS Bcl-2) decreased Bcl-2 protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, a cytotoxic effect was seen only at very restricted cell densities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Below such densities cells underwent spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> without any treatment, while above these cell densities no cytotoxic effect of AS Bcl-2 could be seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The conditioned medium of SU-DHL cells supported the survival and growth of these cells cultivated at low cell densities and partially reversed the cytotoxicity associated with Bcl-2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RT/PCR analysis revealed autocrine expression of IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-5 and TNF-beta in SU-DHL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neutralizing antibodies against these cytokines inhibited SU-DHL proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, development of autocrine GF secretion may be the second step in the pathogenesis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
