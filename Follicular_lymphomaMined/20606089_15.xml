<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is an indolent disorder that is treatable but considered incurable with chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The curative potential of allogeneic transplantation using conventional myeloablative conditioning has been demonstrated, but this approach is precluded in the majority of patients with FL because of excessive toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, reduced-intensity conditioning regimens are being explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study reports the outcome of 82 consecutive patients with FL who underwent transplantation using fludarabine, melphalan, and alemtuzumab for in vivo T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were heavily pretreated, having received a median of four lines of prior therapy, and 26% had experienced treatment failure with previous autologous transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median patient age was 45 years, and 52% of patients received stem cells from unrelated donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With a median follow-up time of 43 months, the nonrelapse mortality was 15% at 4 years (8% for sibling and 22% for unrelated donor transplantations), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> grade 2 or 3 graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in 13%, and the incidence of extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was only 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although relapse risk was 26%, this was significantly reduced where mixed chimerism had been converted to full donor chimerism by the use of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI; P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, 10 (77%) of 13 patients given DLI for relapse after transplantation experienced remission, with nine of these responses being sustained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Current progression-free survival at 4 years was 76% for the whole cohort (90% for those with sibling donors and 64% for those with unrelated donors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The excellent long-term survival with associated low rates of GVHD and the frequency and durability of DLI responses make this an extremely encouraging strategy for the treatment and potential cure of FL </plain></SENT>
