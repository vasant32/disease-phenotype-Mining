<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This approach (the 'deep diff') enabled the detection of small numbers of diagnostically significant cells in a majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found ringed sideroblasts in 5/7 patients with sideroblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and megaloblasts in 9/10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002888" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">megaloblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed centrocytes in seven patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mantle cells in five patients with mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and marginal zone cells in five patients with nodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We detected small percentages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in cytospins of mononuclear leucocytes in 12 patients with large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and anaplastic large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The deep diff was nondiagnostic in 5/6 patients with hairy cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and in 9/10 patients with Waldenstr√∂m's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024419" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">macroglobulinaemia</z:e> and small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these cases, there were insufficient cells to detect light chain restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased counts of leukaemic cells were found in 12/13 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> with &lt; 3% blasts in the conventional white cell differential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased blasts were also observed in six patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Decreased blasts were found in five patients with aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and in nine patients with bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> after intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increased plasma cell counts were observed in 13/14 patients with advanced plasma cell <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the 'deep diff', augmented by immunocytochemistry, may be useful in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haematological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
