<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunoperoxidase stains were performed on fixed and processed lymph nodes from four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three cases were of the intermediate lymphocytic type, and one was of the small cleaved lymphocytic type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the small lymphoid cells of the mantle zones did not stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A monoclonal population (IgM, lambda) of plasma cells and large lymphoid cells was demonstrated predominantly in the paracortical areas in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, small numbers of plasma cells and large lymphoid cells in the follicle centers stained in a polyclonal pattern, confirming the benign nature of the centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the mantle-zone type are exceptions to the theory that follicular B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are derived from follicular center cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Apparently, the lymphoid cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> home to the mantle zones of secondary follicles, where they surround, proliferate, and eventually obliterate residual benign germinal centers </plain></SENT>
