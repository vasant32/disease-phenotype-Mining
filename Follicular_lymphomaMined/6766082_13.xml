<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients staged I, IE, II, and IIE after laparotomy, received involved field radiotherapy with or without adjunctive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cases have been analyzed for survival, disease-free survival, sites of relapse, and subsequent management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, the five-year survival figure was 87% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While this represents only modest improvement over survival figures for patients staged I and II by lymphangiography, results for patients with upper torso disease were significantly better </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although there was a definite incidence of relapse, early failures common in the lymphangiogram series, were not seen in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the total group of 14 patients, 4 relapsed after a minimum complete remission period of 20 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The five-year survival figure for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> presentations of stages I and II diffuse histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This represents a substantial improvement over the corresponding figure of 36% for patients staged clinically after lymphangiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The improvement in results is credited to more precise staging of patients with peripheral presentations, the use of adjunctive multiple-agent chemotherapy for abdominal and mediastinal presentations, and more effective treatment for relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To date, too few patients with peripheral presentations have been treated to determine the value of adjunctive chemotherapy for nodular or diffuse histiocytic patients </plain></SENT>
