<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We characterized the basis for the follicular lymphoproliferation in transgenic mice bearing a Bcl-2-immunoglobulin (Bcl-2-Ig) minigene representing the t(14;18) of human follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Discriminatory S1 nuclease protection assays revealed that the Bcl-2-Ig transgene was overexpressed relative to endogenous mouse Bcl-2 in spleen and thymus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Western (immunoblot) analysis demonstrated the overproduction of the human 25-kilodalton Bcl-2 protein, which arose from the transgene, in spleen, thymus, and the expanded B-cell subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite the generalized lymphoid pattern of deregulation, two-color flow cytometry and density gradient centrifugation indicated that the expanded lymphocytes were predominantly small, resting B cells coexpressing B220, immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgD, Ia, and kappa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle analysis confirmed that about 97% of these expanded B cells reside in G0/G1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An extensive characterization of transgenic lines revealed a fourfold excess of IgM-IgD-expressing B cells in spleen and dramatically increased numbers in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While resting, these cells proliferated in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> and anti-IgM and demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cell colony formation in soft agar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these B cells, which demonstrated an extended survival in vitro even in the absence of stroma, were also resting in G0, yet were capable of proliferative responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings provide consistent evidence that the accumulation of B cells after Bcl-2 overproduction is secondary to prolonged cell survival and not increased cell cycling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests a unique role for Bcl-2 as a proto-oncogene that enhances cell survival independent of promoting cell division </plain></SENT>
