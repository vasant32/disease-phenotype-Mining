<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NHLs constitute a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative diseases</z:e>, including entities with very different epidemiological and evolutive characteristics, as well as prognosis and treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several classifications exist, but in practice, we individualize aggressive NHL including Diffuse Large B-Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) which is the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and indolent NHL including follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The role of the radiotherapy in the management of NHLs varies according to the specific sub-type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but it has become increasingly limited over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall it finds indications with curative intent only in situations of localized LMNH: either associated with chemotherapy as part of a combined modality therapy as for the treatment of localized <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, or as exclusive treatment specially in the rare situations of localized follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, lymphocytes being extremely radiosensitive cells, radiotherapy retains excellent indications with palliative intent for the management of symptomatic bulky <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> masses, and that whatever the sub-type of NHLs may be </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is important to remember that even today the "Involved Field" irradiation type remains the gold standard for the treatment of nodal NHLs, even if we witness at present the emergence of new types of irradiation, which aim to reduce the amount of irradiated tissues to try to limit the risks of delayed radio-induced complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this article is to clarify the specific aspects (epidemiological, radio-anatomical and prognostic characteristics) of each NHLs'sub-types (except primary central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>), as well as the practical modalities of the irradiation (illustrated by a clinical case record) when an indication of radiotherapy is placed for their treatment </plain></SENT>
