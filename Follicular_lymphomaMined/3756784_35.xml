<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During this period, 66% of the patients received involved-field radiotherapy (XRT) alone, and 34% received chemotherapy with or without XRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 5 years, the overall survival was 67%, the cause-specific survival was 73%, and the relapse-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) was 48%, with no relapses to date among nine patients followed beyond 60 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adverse prognostic features for survival included extranodal disease and elevated serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>, adverse features included extranodal disease and bulky abdominal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> was significantly better for patients receiving chemotherapy with or without XRT than for XRT alone (64% versus 37% at 5 years, P = 0.02), despite a higher frequency of adverse prognostic features in the chemotherapy-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>About 50% of Stage I-II follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients may be curable, and the inclusion of chemotherapy in the initial treatment may increase the potentially curable fraction </plain></SENT>
