<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sought to identify the critical gene(s) in this region that is responsible for conferring inferior prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BAC array technology applied to 141 FL specimens detected a minimum region of deletion (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) of âˆ¼97 kb within 1p36.32 in 20% of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Frequent single-nucleotide polymorphism-detected copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity was also found in this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of promoter CpGs in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> did not reveal differential patterns of DNA methylation in samples that differed in 1p36 status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exon sequencing of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> genes identified somatic alterations in the TNFRSF14 gene in 3 of 11 selected cases with matching <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An expanded cohort consisting of 251 specimens identified 46 cases (18.3%) with nonsynonymous mutations affecting TNFRSF14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were associated with the presence of TNFRSF14 mutation in patients whose overall treatment included rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We further showed that inferior OS and DSS were most pronounced in patients whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> contained both TNFRSF14 mutations and 1p36 deletions after adjustment for the International Prognostic Index [hazard ratios of 3.65 (95% confidence interval, 1.35-9.878, P=0.011) and 3.19 (95% confidence interval, 1.06-9.57, P=0.039), respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings identify TNFRSF14 as a candidate gene associated with a subset of FL, based on frequent occurrence of acquired mutations and their correlation with inferior clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
