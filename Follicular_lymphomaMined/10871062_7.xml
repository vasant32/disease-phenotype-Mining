<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Extranodal marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (MZBL) is a recently recognized low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that has been well described in other organs such as the stomach and salivary gland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has only recently been described in skin, where it may be difficult to distinguish from reactive processes and other types of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> such as follicle center <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These cases may have been classified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221269" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudolymphomas</z:e> in the past </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extranodal MZBL was referred to as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> before the Revised European-American Classification of Lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Neoplasms</z:hpo> was published in 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Important histologic features that aid in the diagnosis of MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are atypical lymphocytes (centrocyte-like and monocytoid B cells) often admixed with plasmacytoid lymphocytes, a prominent plasma cell component, lymphoepithelial lesions, intranuclear inclusions (Dutcher bodies), and reactive germinal centers that may be colonized by neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotypic studies demonstrating a B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp>, light chain restriction, coexpression of CD43, and staining of atypical lymphocytes with bcl-2 support a diagnosis of MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We studied 11 cases of extranodal MZBL of the skin from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology files </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were six women and five men ranging in age from 30 to 69 years (median, 54 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The anatomical sites included the trunk, head and neck areas, and upper extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no other sites of disease besides the skin in any of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period ranged from 5 months to 8 years (median, 24 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Histologic results included an atypical lymphoid infiltrate with B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp>, reactive germinal centers, and a variable plasma cell component in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No Dutcher bodies or lymphoepithelial lesions were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Extranodal MZBL of skin is a diagnostic challenge because of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> cellular infiltrate that may be interpreted as a reactive process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The most significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> with which it is confused is follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It is important to recognize the characteristic histologic and immunophenotypic features of extranodal MZBL so that the appropriate therapeutic approach may be applied </plain></SENT>
