<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The frequent occurrence of BCL2-IgH rearrangements in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) makes detection of low numbers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells possible by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of BCL2-IgH in the bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood of many FL patients at the time of autografting has led to the suggestion that selection of the CD34-enriched fraction may lead to reinfusion of lower numbers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, we PCR-amplified BCL2-IgH from fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-purified BM CD34+ and CD34- fractions in seven FL patients showing a PCR-detectable translocation in the major breakpoint region of BCL2, five of which showed morphological BM involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The total CD34+ fraction showed diminished but residual positivity in the first two cases tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, BM cells from the remaining five patients were sorted for the CD34+19- immature population, the CD34+19+ B-cell precursors, and the CD34-19+ mature B-cell fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CD34+19- subpopulation was negative in four of five, despite evident BM infiltration in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the CD34+19+ fraction was positive in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These cells represented 0% to 50% (mean, 18%) of the total CD34+ population, suggesting that, if reinfusion of BCL2-IgH-positive cells plays a role in postautograft relapse in FL, therapeutic CD34 selection procedures should include additional purging of the CD34+19+ B-cell precursors or, at least, assessment of the proportion of CD19+ cells in the CD34+ fraction and its correlation with clinical outcome postreinfusion </plain></SENT>
