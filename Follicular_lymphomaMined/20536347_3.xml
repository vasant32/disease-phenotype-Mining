<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It remains to be clarified whether the outcome has changed after the recent introduction of novel treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 281 patients with FL treated at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Institute of Southern Switzerland from 1979 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three diagnostic eras were considered, according to the major therapeutic changes: before 1989 ('<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> era', n = 73), 1990 to 1999 ('aggressive regimens and G-CSF era', n = 119), and 2000 to 2007 ('rituximab era', n = 89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The distribution of prognostic factors was similar in the three eras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant improvement in cause-specific survival (CSS) was observed over time (p = 0.0088), but not in overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median CSS was 12.5 years for patients with FL diagnosed before 1989, but was not reached in the more recent groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The estimated CSS rate at 5 years in the three eras was 80%, 86%, and 91%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CSS of patients with FL treated at our institution has improved over the last 25 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This improvement, already evident before the wide introduction of rituximab in clinical practice, may be a result of the sequential application of effective therapies and improved supportive care </plain></SENT>
