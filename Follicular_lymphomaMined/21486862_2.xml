<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: The impact of using autologous stem cell transplantation and/or rituximab administration at first progression was investigated, taking into account initial therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With a median follow up of 31 months, 3-year event free and overall survival rates after progression were 50% (95%CI 42-58%) and 72% (95%CI 64-78%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 3-year event free rate of rituximab re-treated patients (n=112) was 52% (95%CI 41-62%) versus 40% (95%CI 24-55%) for those not receiving rituximab second line (n=53) (P=0.075) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in 3-year overall survival between patients receiving autologous stem cell transplantation and those not: 92% (95%CI 78-97%) versus 63% (95%CI 51-72%) (P=0.0003), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, both autologous stem cell transplantation and period of progression/relapse affected event free and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of front-line rituximab exposure, this study supports incorporating autologous stem cell transplantation in the therapeutic approach at first relapse for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
