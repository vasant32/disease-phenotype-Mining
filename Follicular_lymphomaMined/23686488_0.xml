<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The microenvironment of human follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), an incurable B cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, is thought to play a major role in its pathogenesis and course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microenvironmental cells of likely importance include follicular Th cells (TFH) and regulatory T cells (Tregs), and understanding their interactions with FL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells is necessary to develop novel therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that IL-4 and CD40L are expressed by intratumoral TFH and induce production of CCL17 and CCL22 by FL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IL-4 alone induces only CCL17 but enhances stimulation by CD40L of both CCL17 and CCL22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consistent with our in vitro results, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts of IL-4 correlated with CCL17, but not CCL22, in gene expression profiling studies of FL biopsies, whereas CD40L correlated with both CCL17 and CCL22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> supernatants induced preferential migration of Tregs and IL-4-producing T cells rather than IFN-Î³-producing T cells, and Abs to CCR4 significantly abrogated the migration of Tregs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that through two distinct mechanisms, intratumoral TFH induce production of CCL17 and CCL22 by FL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and facilitate active recruitment of Tregs and IL-4-producing T cells, which, in turn, may stimulate more chemokine production in a feed-forward cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, TFH appear to play a major role in generating an immunosuppressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> microenvironment that promotes immune escape and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> survival and growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results provide novel insights into the cross talk among TFH, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, and Tregs in FL, and offer potential targets for development of therapeutic strategies to overcome immune evasion </plain></SENT>
