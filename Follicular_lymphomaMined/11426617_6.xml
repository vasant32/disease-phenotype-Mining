<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant correlation has been demonstrated between prognosis and the microvessel density (a measure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e>, particularly of the breast and prostate, and lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to establish whether a correlation exists between vascular density and the malignant category of Non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) defined by two classification systems (Kiel and Working Formulation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also tested whether florid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFH</z:e>) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) behave as new vessel stimulating conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-nine NHL lymph node biopsies were reviewed and categorized according to the Kiel Classification and Working Formulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve FL were also selected and compared to 12 FFH biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vessels were highlighted by immunostaining with anti-Factor VIII antibody and quantified both by counting higher vascular density fields and by estimating the proportional vascular area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed a statistically significant difference between low and high grade NHL, when classified in either the Working Formulation (p=0.0015) or the Kiel Classification (p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No differences were found in vessel counts between Working formulation intermediate and high grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vascular density is similar when <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFH</z:e> and FL interfollicular areas are compared </plain></SENT>
