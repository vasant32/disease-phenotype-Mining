<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The majority of low-grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) undergo clinical progression toward intermediate- and high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This progression is often associated with histologic transformation from follicular to diffuse-type NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying this evolution are presently unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have analyzed the role in NHL progression of relevant genetic lesions affecting proto-oncogenes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequential biopsies from 21 patients with clinical progression with (5 cases) or without (16 cases) evidence of histologic transformation were analyzed for karyotypic changes, c-myc rearrangements and deletions affecting 6q27 by Southern blot analysis, and p53 mutations by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis coupled with direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No novel cytogenetic aberration was detected in association with progression, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples analyzed displayed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutations of the p53 gene were detected in 4 of 5 cases displaying histologic transformation from follicular to diffuse-type NHL and in none of the 16 cases displaying clinical progression in the absence of histologic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 1 of these positive cases, the same mutation was also present in the pretransformation biopsy, correlating with the presence of diffuse-type areas within a predominant follicular pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 1 of these cases, a deletion of 6q27 was also detected in the posttransformation biopsy along with a p53 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that p53 mutations are associated with and may be responsible for histologic transformation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
