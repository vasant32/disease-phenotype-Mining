<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the heat-stable DNA polymerase Taq and automated cycling of the reaction, we were able to detect as few as one to two copies of bcl-2/JH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under these conditions, PCR proved to be at least 10,000-fold more sensitive than either conventional flow cytometry or Southern blot restriction analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, genomic DNA sequences of four <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> confirmed that the size of the amplified segment serves as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Direct application of PCR to patient staging revealed occult malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in tissue otherwise considered uninvolved by standard criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the striking enhancement in diagnostic sensitivity attained by DNA amplification can serve as a valuable adjunct to the staging and clinical monitoring of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
