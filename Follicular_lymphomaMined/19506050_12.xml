<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>t(14;18) translocations are present in blood from healthy individuals, but there is a trend of increased prevalence in farmers exposed to pesticides, a group recently associated with higher risk of t(14;18)(+) non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A direct connection between agricultural <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> use, t(14;18) in blood, and malignant progression, however, has not yet been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We followed t(14;18) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> over 9 yr in a cohort of farmers exposed to pesticides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that exposed individuals bear particularly high t(14;18) frequencies in blood because of a dramatic clonal expansion of activated t(14;18)(+) B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrate that such t(14;18)(+) clones recapitulate the hallmark features of developmentally blocked FL cells, with some displaying aberrant activation-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminase activity linked to malignant progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our data establish that expanded t(14;18)(+) clones constitute bona fide precursors at various stages of FL development, and provide a molecular connection between agricultural <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> exposure, t(14;18) frequency in blood, and clonal progression </plain></SENT>
