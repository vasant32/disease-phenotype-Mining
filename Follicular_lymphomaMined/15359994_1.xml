<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have examined in a population-based observational study the survival of young patients (less than 40 years) with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) treated conventionally and followed for up to 17 years (minimum 10, median 13 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data were derived from the Scotland and Newcastle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Group (SNLG) database from 1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available cases was reviewed to ensure that patients met the modern criteria for diagnosis of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 55 patients identified from the database, 46 were confirmed to have follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 25 males and 21 females, median age 34 years (range 16-39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients presented with advanced stage disease (Stages III and IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients received initial treatment with chemotherapy, though 7 had surgery (biopsy or splenectomy) alone and 7 radiotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 12 patients with early stage disease showed a complete response (CR) with initial therapy; 6 relapsed and 2 have died (1 of transformation to high grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall survival of patients presenting with stage IIIA disease was 68% at 10 years, and 69% for patients in stages IIIB and IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The SNLG prognostic index for low grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was predictive for overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 71% overall survival in this patient cohort at 10 years provides a baseline for comparison with the results of a more aggressive approach to treatment </plain></SENT>
