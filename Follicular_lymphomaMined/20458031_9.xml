<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received six cycles of CVP followed by one cycle of tositumomab and (131)I-tositumomab (one dosimetric dose and one therapeutic dose) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The treatment was evaluated for efficacy and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 30 patients enrolled completed CVP as well as tositumomab and (131)I-tositumomab therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate after completion of therapy was 100%, with 28 patients (93%) achieving a complete response (CR) and two patients achieving a partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 17 patients with bone marrow involvement at enrollment, 15 achieved a confirmed CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of 15 patients with bulky disease (&gt; or = 5 cm) had a CR after treatment completion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 8.4 years, the median response duration had not been reached (range, 3 to 111+ months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 56% and 83%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common grade &gt; or = 3 hematologic adverse events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (87%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients received growth factor support, and three required blood product transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patients developed human antimurine antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These mature data demonstrate that sequential therapy with a non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-containing regimen comprising CVP followed by one cycle of tositumomab and (131)I-tositumomab produced high response rates with adequate safety and durable remissions and that this regimen represents a highly active treatment for first-line therapy of follicular non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
