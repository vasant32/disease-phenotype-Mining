<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The BCL-6 gene is frequently involved in translocations occurring at the 3q27 locus and is rearranged in approximately 30% of diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and in a small fraction of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The BCL-6 gene encodes for a Kruppel-type zinc-finger protein, the cell/tissue expression and function of which is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we describe a new monoclonal antibody (PG-B6) that is specifically directed against a <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50913">fixative</z:chebi>-sensitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> on the amino-terminal region of the BCL-6 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By immunocytochemical analysis, BCL-6 localizes in the nucleus where PG-B6 staining gives a microgranular/diffuse pattern with exclusion of the nucleoli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main reactivity of PG-B6 in tonsil and spleen is with the nuclei of germinal center B cells, whereas B cells within the mantle and marginal zones do not express BCL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No other lymphoid cells in the tonsil express BCL-6 except for a subset of CD3+/CD4+ intrafollicular and interfollicular T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A few lymphoid cells of unknown phenotype express BCL-6 in the thymus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extra-lymphoid BCL-6 expression includes a weak nuclear positivity of epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, BCL-6 expression parallels that observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid compartments, eg, expression in germinal center-derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (follicular and diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>), but not in mantle cell and marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In most diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the BCL-6 protein is expressed at high levels in cases with or without BCL-6 gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that BCL-6 expression is specifically regulated during B lymphocyte development and suggest that BCL-6 may play a role during B cell differentiation in the germinal center </plain></SENT>
