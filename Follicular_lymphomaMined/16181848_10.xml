<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical characteristics, methods of treatment, and outcomes are not well elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011953'>pulmonary lymphoma</z:hpo> cases at a single institution from 1990 to 2002 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen patients were included, with a mean follow-up of 2.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 2 had large cell transformation of sheet cells in MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 1 each had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography-guided biopsy was diagnostic in only two of eight attempts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had disease confined to the pulmonary parenchyma, and 7 had parenchymal disease as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100721'>mediastinal lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment methods included observation only (n = 1), surgery only (n = 6), surgery plus chemotherapy (n = 8), surgery plus radiotherapy (n = 1), and surgery plus chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier estimate of median time to disease recurrence or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 1 patient died of disease-related causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who had bilateral disease were more likely to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of treatments were used for patients with generally MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, resulting in good outcomes, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> was well controlled </plain></SENT>
