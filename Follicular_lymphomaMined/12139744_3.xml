<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, only approximately 75% of the consequent Bcl-2 breakpoints lie within the major breakpoint region (MBR) or the minor cluster region (mcr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While these can be quantified by cluster region-specific real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR), a significant proportion of cases are left requiring a customized approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, an RQ-PCR assay for the quantification of Bcl-2/IgH breakpoints has been developed that uses germline JH TaqMan probes and germline JH primers in combination with customized forward primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Validation of this approach by comparison with an established MBR RQ-PCR showed both techniques to be concordant across a wide range of copy numbers with a sensitivity of five copies per 10(5) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, to generate standard curves equating to diverse Bcl-2/IgH rearrangements, a strategy for using placental DNA as a surrogate standard was devised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The performance of the assay in detecting molecular evidence of disease in sequential biopsies from five patients (three with atypical Bcl-2/IgH breakpoints identified by long-range or inverse PCR, one MBR+ and one mcr+) was tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This alternative approach represents a sensitive and specific means of quantifying common and atypical Bcl-2/IgH rearrangements and maximizes the number of patients with FL suitable for molecular monitoring </plain></SENT>
