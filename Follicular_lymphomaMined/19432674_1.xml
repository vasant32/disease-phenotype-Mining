<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An 83-year-old man presented with multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000702'>adenopathies</z:mp> and a hilar mass encroaching on the right lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A transbronchial biopsy showed small blue cells suspicious for small cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On further analysis the cells were predominantly small cleaved and CD20 positive, suggesting follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, grade 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An axillary lymph node biopsy showed germinal centers surrounded by monocytoid B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry was negative for CD5 and CD23 and the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> was considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because of the aggressive clinical behavior, including extensive <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> on imaging studies, immunohistochemistry for cyclin D-1 was performed and was positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow was extensively involved and it showed t(11;14), in addition to other complex cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differentiating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> has prognostic and therapeutic implications, particularly when considering the potential role of targeted therapy and cell cycle modulators </plain></SENT>
