<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The distinction between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> (FH) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is one of the classic problems in diagnostic hematopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both MT2 and bcl-2 antibodies have been reported to be useful in making this distinction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To compare the utility of these two commercially obtained antibodies in paraffin-embedded sections, B5-fixed sections from 21 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> and from 46 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were immunostained and the follicles evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neither MT2 nor the bcl-2 antibody showed definite follicular positivity in FH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 66% of FLs were MT2 positive and 89% were bcl-2 positive (P &lt; .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MT2 staining was equivocal in 30% of FHs and 7% of FLs, whereas bcl-2 staining was equivocal in only one FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, MT2 staining was unsatisfactory in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD10 was negative (0% to 3%) in the three bcl-2-negative FLs tested and positive (&gt; 10%) in 26 of 38 bcl-2-positive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate the utility of the commercially obtained bcl-2 antibody in distinguishing FL from FH in B5-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They also illustrate the superiority of the bcl-2 antibody over MT2, which was less sensitive and more problematic to interpret </plain></SENT>
