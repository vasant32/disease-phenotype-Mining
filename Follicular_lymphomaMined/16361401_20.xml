<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To identify occupations suspected to be associated with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and to generate new hypotheses about occupational risks in a multicentre, population based case control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male and female patients with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 710) aged 18-80 years of age were prospectively recruited in six study regions in Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each newly recruited <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> case, a sex, region, and age matched control was drawn from the population registers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for major occupations and industries were calculated using conditional logistic regression analysis, adjusted for smoking (in pack-years) and alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subentities were additionally compared with the entire control group using unconditional logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The following economic/industrial sectors were positively associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>: food products, beverages, tobacco; paper products, publishing and printing; and metals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chemicals; real estate, renting, and business activities were negatively associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors observed an increased overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> risk among architects; maids; farmers; glass formers; and construction workers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Shoemaking and leather goods making was negatively associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosis (although based on small numbers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the occupational group analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subentities, Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was significantly associated only with rubber and plastic products making; diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> risk was considerably increased among metal processors; follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed highly significant risk increases for several occupational groups (medical, dental, and veterinary workers; sales workers; machinery fitters; and electrical fitters); and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> showed a particularly pronounced risk increase for farmers as well as for agriculture and animal husbandry workers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results partly confirm previously defined occupational risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Occupational risk factors for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> might differ from the overall risk factors for malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
