<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The t(14; 18) chromosome translocation occurs nearly exclusively at two hot spots, a major breakpoint clustering region (mbr) within the 2nd exon noncoding region and the minor breakpoint clustering region (mcr) within the 3' flanking region of the bcl-2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that the rearrangement of the bcl-2 gene occurs in a significant fraction (approximately 10%) of B-CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the rearranged bcl-2 genes were juxtaposed with Ig lambda or Ig kappa genes, implying that the bcl-2 gene is preferentially linked to the IgL genes in CLL </plain></SENT>
