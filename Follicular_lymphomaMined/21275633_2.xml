<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We assessed the efficacy of fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and rituximab in combination (FCR) as frontline treatment in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) followed by rituximab maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five untreated patients with FL received FCR followed by maintenance with rituximab 375 mg/m(2) weekly during 4 weeks and every 6 months for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 100%, with 89% complete remission (CR) and 11% partial remission (PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Molecular remission was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only eight patients completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> therapy planned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 47 months, the 5-year overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and event-free survival (EFS) were 77%, 93%, and 72%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age below 60 and low Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) correlated with a better EFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten patients died due to toxic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The FCR regimen is highly effective in untreated patients with FL, with 89% CR, including molecular responses, and a low progression rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the high incidence of treatment-related mortality makes this regimen unsafe and it cannot be recommended as an upfront therapy in FL </plain></SENT>
