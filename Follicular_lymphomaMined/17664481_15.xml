<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is an indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with a long median overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a considerable number of patients die within the first 2 years after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because the treatment options vary with respect to antitumor effect and potential toxic adverse effects, the identification of high-risk patients would be helpful in directing therapeutic decisions in individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several histopathologic biomarkers for risk stratification have been suggested, but most markers have not been validated in patients treated in prospective trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report a comprehensive approach to evaluate histopathologic biomarkers, including WHO grade, histology, and proliferation and quantitation of immune bystander cells, in 158 patients with nodal advanced-stage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated first line within a randomized trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> was a significant prognostic marker of poor overall survival that was independent of the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>WHO grade, proliferation, and total T-cell or macrophage content were not associated with overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is a marker of poor overall survival that is independent of the FLIPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The quantification of macrophage or absolute T-cell content, grading, and proliferation are of no help in predicting the outcome of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Future studies need to identify surrogate markers for the prognostic immune signatures identified by gene expression profiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, new prognostic markers need to be confirmed in patients treated within prospective trials </plain></SENT>
