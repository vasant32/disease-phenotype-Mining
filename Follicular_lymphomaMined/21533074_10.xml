<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A previous genome-wide association study has established a marker, rs10484561 in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region on 6p21.32 associated with increased FL risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, in a three-stage genome-wide association study, starting with a genome-wide scan of 379 FL cases and 791 controls followed by validation in 1,049 cases and 5,790 controls, we identified a second independent FL-associated locus on 6p21.32, rs2647012 (OR(combined)  = 0.64, P(combined)  = 2 × 10(-21)) located 962 bp away from rs10484561 (r(2)&lt;0.1 in controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After mutual adjustment, the associations at the two SNPs remained genome-wide significant (rs2647012:OR(adjusted)  = 0.70, P(adjusted)  =  4 × 10(-12); rs10484561:OR(adjusted)  = 1.64, P(adjusted)  = 5 × 10(-15)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Haplotype and coalescence analyses indicated that rs2647012 arose on an evolutionarily distinct haplotype from that of rs10484561 and tags a novel allele with an opposite (protective) effect on FL risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in a follow-up analysis of the top 6 FL-associated SNPs in 4,449 cases of other NHL subtypes, rs10484561 was associated with risk of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR(combined)  = 1.36, P(combined)  =  1.4 × 10(-7)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results reveal the presence of allelic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> within the HLA class II region influencing FL susceptibility and indicate a possible shared genetic etiology with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the HLA class II region plays a complex yet important role in NHL </plain></SENT>
