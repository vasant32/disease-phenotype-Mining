<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Five hundred and nineteen patients with follicular center cell (FCC) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in Osaka, Japan were selected for study from 1000 patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were admitted to hospital during 1964-1987, which was divided into three periods 1964-1972 (I), 1973-1979 (II), and 1980-1987 (III) to examine the time trend of FCC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age of patients rose from 51 to 55 years of age with an increase in female and extranodal disease patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of nodal FCC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nodal NHL increased from 37.5 to 51.5% (P less than 0.05), but that of extranodal types decreased from 82.9 to 56.8% (P less than 0.01), although the total number showed little change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the cases were categorized as diffuse type and follicular type, the diffuse type predominated through the period in both nodal and extranodal sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of follicular type among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL were 10.2, 6.3, and 8.4% during the periods I, II and III, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results showed that follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was a minor constituent of NHL in Japan compared to Western countries, and the frequency did not increase from 1964 to 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of FCC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in the present series was rather higher than that in Western countries, therefore it is concluded that FCC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in Japanese have much less potential for forming a follicular structure than those in patients from Western countries </plain></SENT>
