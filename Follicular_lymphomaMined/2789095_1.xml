<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients with primary follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of lymph nodes who developed <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>Skin lesions</z:mp> involved the scalp, head and neck, trunk, and buttocks and were small cleaved cell type in four cases, large cell type in three cases, and mixed type in four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The follicular pattern with a bottom-heavy distribution was identified in only six of the 11 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One case showed a nodular, perivascular pattern in the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four cases were characterized by a diffuse pattern of lymphocytic infiltrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient with a diffuse pattern had an isolated subepidermal band of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells representing primary cutaneous T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cutaneous involvement by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> previously diagnosed as low-grade (follicular growth pattern) transformed to higher grade disease in five of ten asynchronous cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rate was 60% among the transformed cases and 100% among the nontransformed cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Extranodal cutaneous involvement in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> occurred in 3.8% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The correct histologic diagnosis in a skin biopsy specimen can be established in cases with a follicular pattern (60%) with conventional histologic criteria such as redundancy of follicles, uniformity of follicular center cell composition, lack of interspersed phagocytic histiocytes, and absence of immunosecretory cellular elements such as plasma cells and immunoblasts </plain></SENT>
