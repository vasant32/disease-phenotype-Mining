<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported associations between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> risk and germline polymorphisms in genes of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR C677T and A1298C) and methionine synthase (MTR A2756G), finding the genotype other than the MTHFR 677CC/1298AA to confer a half-risk compared to the MTHFR 677CC/1298AA and a 3-fold higher risk with the MTR GG genotype than the AA/AG genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To confirm the association and explore the histological difference, we extended the previous case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A case-control study was conducted in Japan with a total of 372 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases and 500 noncancer controls examined for genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative risks were estimated by unconditional logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In overall analyses, the age-sex adjusted odds ratio (OR) for the subjects harboring MTHFR 677T or 1298C alleles relative to 677CC/1298AA genotype was 0.58 (95% confidence interval: 0.41-0.83, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The MTR GG genotype showed an OR of 1.75 (0.87-3.52, P = 0.114) </plain></SENT>
