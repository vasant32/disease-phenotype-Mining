<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify the associated clinicopathological prognostic parameters, we examined the correlation of 11 histopathological parameters with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in 107 consecutive patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> with preexisting (asynchronous) or synchronous FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients comprised 58 men and 49 women with a median age of 56 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, the complete response rate was 81%, overall response rate was 88%, and 5-year PFS and OS rates were 55% and 79%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> component revealed the following positivity rates: CD10, 64%; Bcl-2, 83%; Bcl-6, 88%; MUM1, 42%; GCB, 82%; cMyc index ≥80%, 17%; and Ki-67 index ≥90%, 19% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IGH/BCL2 fusion was positive in 57% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In univariate analyses, asynchronous FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (24%, P = 0.021), 100% proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (29%, P = 0.004), Bcl-2 positivity (P = 0.04), and high Ki-67 index (P = 0.003) were significantly correlated with shorter PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Asynchronous FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (P = 0.003), 100% proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (P = 0.001), and high Ki-67 index (P = 0.004) were significantly correlated with shorter OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, asynchronous FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (P = 0.035) and 100% proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (P = 0.016) were significantly correlated with shorter OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, asynchronism and 100% proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, that is, FL relapsed as pure <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, or FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> at different sites, were significant predictors of unfavorable outcome of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> transformed from FL </plain></SENT>
