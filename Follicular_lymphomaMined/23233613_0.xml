<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with advanced follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) have numerous treatment options, including observation, radiotherapy, single-agent or combination chemotherapy, mAbs, and radioimmunoconjugates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These therapies can extend progression-free survival but none can provide a cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains the only curable therapy for FL, with the field shifting more toward the use of reduced-intensity conditioning regimens because of the lower associated nonrelapse mortality compared with myeloablative regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, GVHD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> are still problematic in the allo-HSCT population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autologous HSCT (auto-HSCT) confers high response rates and prolongs progression-free survival in relapsed patients who are chemosensitive, and an increasing amount of data suggest that auto-HSCT may be curative if offered to relapsed patients who are not heavily pretreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Auto-HSCT has no role as consolidation therapy for patients in first remission based on the results from 3 large randomized trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Novel conditioning regimens with radioimmunoconjugates have been used in both auto-HSCT and allo-HSCT regimens and results have shown efficacy even in chemorefractory patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, with the exception of patients in first remission, the optimal timing for HSCT remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the outcomes seen after auto-HSCT and allo-HSCT continue to improve, and HSCT represents a treatment modality that should be considered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FL patients, especially while their disease remains chemoresponsive </plain></SENT>
