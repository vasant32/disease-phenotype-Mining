<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the finding of its presence in foods in 2002, epidemiological studies have found some suggestive associations between dietary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28619">acrylamide</z:chebi> exposure and the risk of various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this prospective study is to investigate for the first time the association between dietary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28619">acrylamide</z:chebi> intake and the risk of several histological subtypes of lymphatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Netherlands Cohort Study on diet and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> includes 120,852 men and women followed-up since September 1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of person years at risk was estimated by using a random sample of participants from the total cohort that was chosen at baseline (n =5,000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28619">Acrylamide</z:chebi> intake was estimated from a food frequency questionnaire combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28619">acrylamide</z:chebi> data for Dutch foods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28619">acrylamide</z:chebi> intake as a continuous variable as well as in categories (quintiles and tertiles), for men and women separately and for never-smokers, using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 16.3 years of follow-up, 1,233 microscopically confirmed cases of lymphatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> were available for multivariable-adjusted analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, HRs for men were 1.14 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.27) and 1.28 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.61) per 10 Âµg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28619">acrylamide</z:chebi>/day increment, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For never-smoking men, the HR for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> was 1.98 (95% CI: 1.38, 2.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No associations were observed for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found indications that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28619">acrylamide</z:chebi> may increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This is the first epidemiological study to investigate the association between dietary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28619">acrylamide</z:chebi> intake and the risk of lymphatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, and more research into these observed associations is warranted </plain></SENT>
