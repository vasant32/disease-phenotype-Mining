<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The case involved a 72-year-old man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He was diagnosed as having follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, grade 1, clinical stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IVA</z:e> from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040411" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tongue tumor</z:e> biopsy in January 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 6 courses of R-CHOP therapy was performed, but no clear effect was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A new cervical lesion appeared, so he was treated with a total of 2 courses of R-EPOCH therapy, and the effect was classed as stable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We started cladribine therapy (0.09 mg/kg, seven days of continuous infusion) from February 2004, and complete remission was achieved after 4 courses of cladribine therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In January 2005, an abnormal nodular shadow in the right S10 area was found on chest CT images which was diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0276688" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary cryptococcosis</z:e> by serum antigen and a trans-bronchial lung biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We started <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi> (200 mg a day, initially intravenous drip infusion, followed by oral intake), following which both the pulmonary shadow and serum antigen improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Afterward, the fifth course of cladribine therapy and local radiation therapy were performed against a relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010414" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cryptococcosis</z:e> did not reappear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prolonged bone marrow suppression after cladribine therapy was considered to be a severe adverse event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that it is very important to pay attention to any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">opportunistic infection</z:e> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0276688" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary cryptococcosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
