<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median recovery of nucleated cells (NC) and CD34+ cells was 59.3% (40.5-74) and 56.1% (30.8-82.9) in BM and 77.2% (64.7-88.3) and 73.5% (61.5-98.6) in PBPC (P&lt;0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A median of &gt;1.62 and &gt;1.02 log of target cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> was achieved as judged by flow cytometry analysis in BM and PBPC, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 29% of initial harvests that had a bcl2 PCR-amplified signal, 37.5% became PCR negative in the final purged products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Absorbed cells containing IMB-target cell complexes gave bcl2 rearrangement signal in 20% of samples in which the start and final purged components were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three of 26 patients receiving an autologous purged product are evaluable for engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median time to reach an ANC &gt;0.5x10(9)/l and platelet count &gt;20x10(9)/l was 21 (11-43) and 41 days (13-70) for BM (n = 9) and 14 (10-31) and 14 (8-37) for PBPC (n = 14) autografted patients (P = 0.01 and 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient did not engraft and was rescued with a back-up BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that this indirect immunomagnetic technique is able to achieve a high grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> in BM and PBPC and that these purged products are capable of rapid engraftment after autologous transplantation </plain></SENT>
