<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: CD10 is a proteolytic enzyme expressed on the surface of germinal center cells and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> derived from these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is a well-known association between CD10 expression and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of follicular center cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the reported frequency of CD10 positivity in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is widely variable, and no studies have addressed the importance of assessing the intensity of CD10 expression in the diagnosis of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we utilized flow cytometry to determine differences in CD10 expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cell suspensions from 61 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 43 diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and 44 lymph nodes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> were analyzed simultaneously with phycoerythrin-labeled anti-CD20 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi>-labeled anti-CD10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CD10 expression was mainly observed on B cells and was detected in 89% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 56% of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and 55% of lymph nodes showing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo>, two subpopulations of B cells displaying dim and bright CD20 expression were recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD10 expression was restricted to the bright CD20-positive cells, which accounted for an average of 16% of B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In CD10-positive follicular and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases, a significantly higher proportion of B cells (73%) coexpressed CD10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the intensity of CD10 expression in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was much higher than that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative flow cytometry can detect significant differences in CD10 expression between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> follicular cells and follicular or diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of CD10 intensity of expression as well as the fraction of CD10-expressing B cells should help distinguish reactive from neoplastic B-cell processes </plain></SENT>
