<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several recent reports have suggested that nodular lymphocyte predominance <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (NLPHD) may be distinct from other forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and may be more closely related to B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is primarily based on immunophenotypic studies that have shown that the L &amp; H cells in NLPHD demonstrate a B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 1989, Poppema reported that the T cells in NLPHD differ from T cells in other forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> in that they demonstrate reactivity for Leu 7 (CD57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we tested the hypothesis that Leu 7 (CD57) reactivity of small lymphocytes in NLPHD is an immunophenotypic feature that distinguishes NLPHD from nodular sclerosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and from certain B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that may histologically simulate NLPHD, namely T-cell-rich B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using an image analysis method, we found Leu 7 (CD57) reactivity in an average of 18.9% of the small lymphocytes in the nodules of NLPHD compared with 3.9% in nodular sclerosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, 4.3% in T-cell-rich B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 2.1% in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Leu 7 (CD57)-reactive small lymphocytes often showed a distinctive pattern in NLPHD, forming a ring of cells around the large L &amp; H cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While scattered Leu 7 (CD57)-reactive lymphocytes were found in the other disorders, the percentage of reactive cells and the pattern of reactivity were significantly different in NLPHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Leu 7 (CD57) reactivity may be used as an additional immunophenotypic criterion in distinguishing NLPHD from nodular sclerosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, T-cell-rich B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical and biological significance of Leu 7 (CD57) reactivity of small lymphocytes in NLPHD merits further investigation </plain></SENT>
