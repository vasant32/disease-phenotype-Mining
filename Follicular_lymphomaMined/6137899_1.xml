<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A murine monoclonal antibody, HNK-1, is known to react with some human leukocytes including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> natural killer (NK) cells in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The distribution of cells reacting with this antibody (HNK-1+ cell) was studied in human peripheral lymphoid organs, consisting of five lymph nodes, two specimens of gastric mucosa with lymphoid tissue, two tonsils, one appendix, and two thymuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen cases of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ML) were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the demonstration of HNK-1+ cells, the peroxidase-antiperoxidase (<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>) bridge method was applied to cryostat sections of these specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was found that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid organs most HNK-1+ cells were located in lymph follicles, especially in germinal centers, and some were found in 'mixed' regions which indicate outsides of both the follicles and T-zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Amongst the ML, large clusters of HNK-1+ cells were observed only in two cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, although a few scattered HNK-1+ cells were noted in other ML, including five diffuse B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, six T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and one null cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The possible significance of these findings is discussed </plain></SENT>
