<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histologic parameters were percentage of large cells (less than 10%, 41 patients; 10-25%, 38 patients; 25-50%, 11 patients; greater than or equal to 50%, 30 patients), percentage of diffuse areas, presence of intrafollicular proliferation or <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, and mitotic scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty percent of the patients achieved complete remission (CR) with radiotherapy for localized stages and various chemotherapy regimens for disseminated stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients did not respond to treatment, and 23 were in partial remission (PR) at the end of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median survival time was 9.25 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A constant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate of 8% per year was observed without plateau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histologic progression was observed in 32 patients; it occurred at a constant rate during the first six years and plateaued thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with low response rate were stage IV, B symptoms, high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> mass, and two or more extranodal sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with histologic progression were bone marrow involvement and two or more extranodal sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with poor survival were advanced stage, two or more extranodal sites, bone marrow involvement, high <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase level, and absence of interfollicular <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The percentages of large cells and diffuse areas had no influence on prognosis, nor had the type of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median survival has not been reached for CR patients and was four years for PR patients (P less than 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The LNH-84 prognostic index for aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> mass, number of extranodal sites, stage, and LDH level, is a clear-cut indicator of prognosis in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> too.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
