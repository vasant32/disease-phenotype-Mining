<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present six cases of a series of 75 well diagnosed FL patients in which variant fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) patterns for this rearrangement were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, G-banding cytogenetics and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods were unable to detect t(14;18)(q32;q21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to our results, FISH is the best technique to define variant rearrangements of IGH/BCL2 genes and is important to detect it in cases with non-conclusive FL characteristics to avoid misdiagnosis with other NHL </plain></SENT>
