<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The BLA expression of eight Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines was high, whereas it was negative in four, including the two IgG producers tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> origin had only a low percentage of positive cells, not significantly above background, although a few had up to 30% positives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBV conversion of the EBV-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line Ramos destabilized the high BLA expression, leading to a decrease in the average number of positive cells in the majority of the converted sublines in parallel with considerable fluctuation in antigen expression within each subline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our group has previously shown that EBV-conversion of Ramos cells can induce certain differentiation steps (Spira et al., 1981 a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EBV-converted sublines of another EBV-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, BJAB, showed a much greater stability previously and remained unchanged with regard to BLA expression in our present experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, three myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> lines and two diffuse histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were negative for BLA, whereas two <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> lines were 30-40% positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A histiocytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> had marginal reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hybrids derived from the fusion of high with low BLA-reactive parental lines showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three possible patterns (high, intermediate and low), provided that B-cell lines were fused with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fusion of two Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines with the K562 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> line led to the extinction of BLA expression, as well as to the eclipse of other B-cell markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) cells harvested directly from the patient showed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> reactivity pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Strong to intermediate BLA expression was found among CLL cells and in most histological groups of B-CLL <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> except the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> group (3/3 negatives) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IgG-expressing follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were less reactive than IgM +/- IgD <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the same group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Immunocytomas</z:e> were also low-reactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>BLA can be thus expressed on a variety of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>; the degree of its expression appears to be related to the stage of differentiation </plain></SENT>
