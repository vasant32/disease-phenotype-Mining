<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical and prognostic studies were carried out in 99 patients with FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The distribution of patients in IPI risk groups was 44.4%, 19.2%, and 36.4% of cases classified as low, intermediate, and high risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to ILI, low-, intermediate-, and high-risk scores were present in 34.3%; 27.3%, and 38.4% of FL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After applying the FLIPI index, the patients were divided into three risk groups: low (21.2% of cases), intermediate (39.4%), and high (39.4%) of FL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival curves demonstrated a high significant difference for the low- and high-risk group according to IPI and FLIPI (log rank=91.13 and 82.17 respectively; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Difference in overall survival (OS) and failure-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e>) among low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups according to ILI was statistically significant (log rank test p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three indices are important tools for prognostic evaluation of FL patients, as well as useful in identifying FL patients with poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IPI and FLIPI classify patients into two risk groups (low/intermediate- and high-risk groups) with significance difference in OS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e>, but ILI is more reliable in stratifying patients in low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups </plain></SENT>
