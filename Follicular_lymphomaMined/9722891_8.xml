<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>T-cell-derived growth factors are involved in the development of GC B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, their role in the pathogenesis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> has not been clearly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the co-stimulatory activity of 14 cytokines (interleukin-1 to -8, IL-10, IL-13, INF-alpha, TNF-alpha, GM-CSF and SCF) on the proliferation of CD40-activated follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in comparison to tonsillar GC B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tonsillar GC B-cells (n = 4), malignant cells from diagnostic lymph node biopsies of patients with follicular (n = 4) or transformed (n = 4) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were grown on irradiated CD40-ligand transfectants, with and without cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>[3H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> uptake was measured at day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IL-10 and IL-4 proved to be the most potent co-stimulators of proliferation of tonsillar GC B-cells, whereas proliferation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells was co-stimulated by IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fact that IL-4 is a T-cell derived cytokine, suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> infiltrating T-cells play a role in the growth of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, proliferation of both non-neoplastic tonsillar GC B-cells and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is co-stimulated by T-cell derived cytokines, indicating that responsiveness to paracrine factors may not be a characteristic of the malignant phenotype </plain></SENT>
