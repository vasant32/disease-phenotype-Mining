<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation in these patients remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Myeloablative chemotherapy or radioimmunotherapy supported by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation has been shown to lead to a longer progression-free survival and, in some studies, improved survival over standard therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in the era of rituximab-based therapies used as part of induction or salvage, these historical trials may not be representative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic stem cell transplantation offers the advantages of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-free graft and some immunologic graft-versus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, fully myeloablative transplants have high morbidity and mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dose-reduced conditioning regimens followed by allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation have substantially reduced treatment-related mortality and perhaps will produce better outcomes long-term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This article outlines some historical information regarding stem cell transplantation for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and discusses recent modifications that may improve outcomes, such as adding radioimmunotherapy to autologous stem cell transplantation or using alternative dose-reduced regimens that could benefit patients with reduced toxicities </plain></SENT>
