<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reliance on small samples obtained with cutting needles has been advocated as a less invasive alternative to using larger, excised samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although published studies have demonstrated the safety and apparent sufficiency of this approach in informing clinical care, none have systematically determined the accuracy of pathologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtyping based on very small samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a tissue microarray representing 67 cases of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 17 samples of nonneoplastic lymphoid tissue to model <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosis in small samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, 73.8% of the cases were diagnosed with a level of confidence deemed sufficient for directing clinical management; 85.9% of these diagnoses were accurate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Small cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with highly distinctive immunophenotypes, including small lymphocytic, mantle cell, and T-lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, were recognized most consistently and accurately in the small samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were especially difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the reliability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnoses based on small samples is heavily influenced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
