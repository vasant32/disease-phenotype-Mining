<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is debated whether follicular large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FLCL) has a clinical behavior that is distinct from indolent follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and whether there is a subset of patients who can be potentially cured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here our experience with 100 FLCL patients treated at our institution since 1984 with three successive programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the predictive value of pretreatment clinical features, including two risk models, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> Score System and the International Prognostic Index (IPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 67 months, the 5-year survival is 72% and the failure-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e>) is 67%, with a possible plateau in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> curve, particularly for patients with stage I-III disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Features associated with shorter survival included age &gt;/=60, elevated lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) or beta-2-microglobulin (beta2M), advanced stage, and bone marrow involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stage III patients had significantly better survival than stage IV patients (P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By the IPI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> Score System, 80% of the patients were in the lower risk groups; both systems stratified patients into prognostic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with FLCL have clinical features and response to treatment similar to that reported for diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prognostic risk systems for aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are useful for FLCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A meaningful fraction of patients may possibly be cured when treated as aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
