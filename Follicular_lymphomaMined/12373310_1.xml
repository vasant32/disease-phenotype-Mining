<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histologic grade was I in 6 cases, II in 3, and III in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA was selectively extracted from the neoplastic follicles of paraffin-embedded samples with use of laser capture microdissection method, and used for PCR-based analysis of rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three different follicles in each case of FL were microdissected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Semi-nested PCR was performed using two sets of primers (Fr2A and Fr3A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In PCR with Fr2A primers, nine of 12 cases showed a common band among neoplastic follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining three cases showed no PCR products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With Fr3A primers, eight of 12 cases showed a common band among follicles of the same case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other four cases showed oligoclonal bands, among them presence of a common band was difficult to assess </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Oligoclonal bands were more frequently observed in PCR with Fr3A than that with Fr2A and in grade I or II than in grade III cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In total, 11 of 12 cases showed a common band in PCR with either Fr2A or Fr3A primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In two cases, DNA extracted from whole section was amplified with both Fr2A and Fr3A or only Fr3A primers, showing smear or oligoclonal bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results showed the presence of a single clone of cells in neoplastic follicles of FL and the usefulness of PCR-based rearrangement analysis of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene combined with microdissection methods for differential diagnosis of FL from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
