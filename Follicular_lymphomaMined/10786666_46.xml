<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the human hematopoietic system, TCL1 expression is predominantly observed in developing B lymphocytes, whereas its overexpression in T cells causes mature T-cell proliferation in transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, using a newly generated monoclonal antibody against recombinant TCL1 protein, we extended our analysis mainly by immunohistochemistry and also by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and Western blot to a large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> data bank including 194 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> of B- and T-cell origin as well as reactive lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results obtained show that in reactive lymphoid tissues, TCL1 is strongly expressed by a subset of mantle zone B lymphocytes and is expressed to a lesser extent by follicle center cells and by scattered interfollicular small lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, TCL1 was expressed in the majority of the cases, including lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (60%), and primary cutaneous B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TCL1 expression was observed in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, as confirmed by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, TCL1 was not expressed in Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg cells, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myelomas</z:hpo>, marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, CD30+ anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, lymphoblastic T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mycosis fungoides</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that TCL1 is expressed in more differentiated B cells, under both reactive and neoplastic conditions, from antigen committed B cells and in germinal center B cells and is down-regulated in the latest stage of B-cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
