<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine the frequency of bcl-2 gene rearrangement in B-cell Non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and identify different breakpoints of bcl-2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty cases of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (including 8 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 19 cases of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 3 cases of T-cell rich B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Good quality of DNA was extracted in 4 cases from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue and in 26 cases from fine needle aspirate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The polymerase chain reaction was done for major break point region (mbr), minor cluster region (mcr) and intermediate cluster region (icr) of the bcl-2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The bcl-2 gene rearrangement was identified in 23.3% of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 50% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 15% of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and no bcl-2 rearrangement was identified in any of the T-cell rich B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further analysis showed the icr breakpoint in 16.7% of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 37.5% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 10.5% of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Involvement of the mbr breakpoint was found in 6.7% of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 12.5% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 5.3% of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Involvement of the mcr breakpoint was not seen in any of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The bcl-2 gene rearrangement is quite frequent in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, followed by diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The commonest breakpoint in present series is icr followed by mbr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This indicates that primers for bcl-2 gene must include icr primer, whenever the bcl-2 gene is being evaluated for B-cell NHL in this part of the world and this might reduce the variability of frequency of bcl-2 gene rearrangement within and between different regions </plain></SENT>
