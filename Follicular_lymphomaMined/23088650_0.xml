<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report findings in high-risk patients (FL International Prognostic Index [FLIPI] score ≥3, and high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden by modified <z:chebi fb="98" ids="24433">Groupe</z:chebi> d'Etude des <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphomas</z:hpo> Folliculaires [GELF] criteria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients aged ≥18 years with grade 1/2 FL, ≥1 measurable lesion, and documented relapse or progression following prior therapy, rituximab-naïve or rituximab-sensitive, were enrolled at 164 centers in 29 countries across Europe, the Americas, and Asia-Pacific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized (1:1) to five 5-week cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi>-rituximab (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> 1.6 mg/m2, days 1, 8, 15, and 22, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cycles; rituximab 375 mg/m2, days 1, 8, 15, and 22, cycle 1, and day 1, cycles 2-5; N=336) or rituximab alone (N=340) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint of the study was PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 103 bortezomib-rituximab and 98 rituximab patients had high-risk FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ORR was 59% versus 37% (p=0.002), the CR/CRu rate was 13% versus 6% (p=0.145), and the durable response rate was 45% versus 26% (p=0.008) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi>-rituximab versus rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median PFS was 9.5 versus 6.7 months (hazard ratio [HR] 0.667, p=0.012) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi>-rituximab versus rituximab; median time to progression was 10.9 versus 6.8 months (HR 0.656, p=0.009); median time to next anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treatment was 14.8 versus 9.1 months (HR 0.762, p=0.103); and the 1-year Overall Survival rate was 83.1% versus 76.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, 51% of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi>-rituximab and 32% of rituximab patients reported grade ≥3 adverse events, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (18%, 6%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (4%, 5%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (8%, 0%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (5%, 2%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>sensory neuropathy</z:hpo> (1%, 0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High-risk FL patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi>-rituximab had significantly higher ORR and longer PFS than patients receiving rituximab alone, with greater clinical benefit than in the overall study population; additional toxicity was acceptable and did not affect treatment feasibility </plain></SENT>
