<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Deletions and rearrangements involving the long arm of chromosome 11 are not infrequent occurrences in the non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene, the multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0100568'>endocrine neoplasia</z:hpo> type 1 gene (MEN1) was cloned and mapped to chromosome 11q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess the potential involvement of this gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e>, we examined 94 primary cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 12 cell lines by a combination of fluorescent in situ hybridization and PCR-SSCP analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our initial analysis of 41 primary B or T <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, MEN1 FISH analysis revealed allelic deletions in 15 cases (three of four B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo>, six of 15 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, three of nine diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, two of five mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, one of four Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To discern whether the MEN1 gene was in fact the target of the deletions, we assessed 20 of these 41 cases and an additional 74 primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 12 cell lines for MEN1 gene mutations using PCR-SSCP analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abnormal SSCP patterns were found in exon 2 in two of the primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases and in one of the cell lines, but not in any of the original cases that showed MEN1 deletions by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, sequencing analysis revealed that the abnormal SSCP patterns in exon 2 were the result of a previously described genetic polymorphism (S145S: AGC --&gt; ACT), and in one sample, the result of this S145S polymorphism associated with a second nucleotide substitution at position 498 which left the encoded amino acid unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study indicates that the 11q13 locus is a frequent target of deletion in lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, but that there are no associated mutations of the MEN1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the 11q deletions either target another gene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, or that the MEN1 gene is inactivated through means other than mutation </plain></SENT>
