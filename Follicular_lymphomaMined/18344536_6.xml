<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-four patients were enrolled in the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points were the in vivo purging effect on stem-cell harvest and the impact of molecular response on the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At enrollment, 59% of patients were PCR+ for bcl-2 rearrangement in bone marrow (PCR-informative) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the immunochemotherapy, before mobilization, 97% obtained complete response or partial response and 87% of patients informative for bcl-2 were molecularly negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one patients proceeded to in vivo purging and peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization with rituximab and high-dose AraC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median number of CD34+ cells collected was 16.6 x 10(6)/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 33 PCR-informative patients, the harvests resulted in PCR- in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight patients received high-dose therapy and autotransplant of in vivo purged PBSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 3.5 years, 41 patients are in complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five-year PFS is 59% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that patients with advanced relapsed or refractory follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated with immunochemotherapy, in vivo purging and autotransplant may obtain long-lasting PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In bcl-2-positive patients, in vivo purging allows the harvest of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-free PBSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Absence of the bcl-2 rearrangement after autotransplant is associated with persistent clinical remission </plain></SENT>
