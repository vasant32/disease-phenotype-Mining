<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) who do not respond to first-line chemotherapy or those who relapse after obtaining a remission have a poor outcome with standard treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an effort to obtain a high rate of responses we designed an intensive brief duration salvage chemotherapy regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Forty-four consecutive patients with advanced follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine had primary refractory disease, 13 had achieved a partial remission, 16 were in untreated relapse or progression and six were in chemosensitive relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The IAPVP-16 regimen consists in ifosfamide 5 g/m(2) iv on day 1, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> 100 mg/m(2) iv on days 1-3, Ara-C 1.2 g/m(2)/12 hours iv on days 1-2 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>, 80 mg/m(2) iv on days 1-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was used from day 6 in 68 of 114 courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen patients (41%) achieved a complete remission and 17 (39%) a partial remission, for an overall response rate of 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> treatment courses were followed by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, and 66% also by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, but there were no serious hemorrhagic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> occurred in 56% of the courses with only four severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Non-hematologic toxicity was modest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients proceeded to a stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 25 months (range 4-95), the median progression-free survival and overall survival are 32 and 58 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The median PFS was 33 months for responders and 11 months for non-responders (p=0.05), while the median OS has not been reached in responders and is 23 months in non-responders (p=0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS:  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The IAPVP-16 regimen is an effective and well tolerated treatment for advanced FL, allowing most eligible patients to proceed with significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> reduction to high-dose therapy and SCT </plain></SENT>
