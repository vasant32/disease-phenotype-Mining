<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The histologic diagnoses in the 100 cases were follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) in 58, marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>) in 17, small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 15, and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) in 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 58 FLs, 57 were CD10 positive (98% sensitivity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 1 negative case was unusual in that it occurred in the small intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However; architectural, cytologic, and immunohistochemicalfeatures were diagnostic of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 42 other SBCLs, 2 were CD10+ (95% specificity); 1 was a CD5+/cyclin D1 + <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, and the other was an extranodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that assessment of CD10 expression using multiparameter flow cytometry with cluster analysis is highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of FL, validating its usefulness in situations in which adequate tissue is not available for definitive histologic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
