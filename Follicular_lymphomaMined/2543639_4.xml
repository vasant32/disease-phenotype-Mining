<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the highly malignant group, anti-EBNA-1 geometric mean titers (GMT) were 13.2 (range less than 2-80) and anti-EBNA-2 60.6 (range: 20-320) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ratio between the logarithms of anti-EBNA-1 and anti-EBNA-2 antibody titers was less than 1.0 (mean: 0.32) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 6 out of 8 patients of the low malignant group, anti-EBNA-1 titers were higher (mean: 30.1; range 10-160) than anti-EBNA-2 titers (mean: 4.3; range less than 2-80) and the EBNA 1/2 ratio was greater than 1.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In healthy EBV-seropositive individuals, anti-EBNA-1 GMT were 49 (range: 10-320) and only 5 out of 17 individuals had detectable anti-EBNA-2 titers (GMT: 3; range less than 5-20) </plain></SENT>
