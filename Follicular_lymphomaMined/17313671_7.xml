<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Both mechanistic features and recent correlative findings suggest a potential role for protein kinase C-beta (PKC-beta) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> pathogenesis, particularly in B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the role of this gene in lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, we analyzed global gene expression data to quantify PKC-beta expression across diagnostic groups and, when possible, determined correlations between PKC-beta expression and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our analysis showed that the level of PKC-beta expression was highest in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within diffuse large-B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), PKC-beta expression was significantly higher in activated B-cell- like subtype than germinal center B-cell- like subtype (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elevated PKC-beta appeared to be associated with worse survival in both of these subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When analyzed within clinically defined risk groups established by the International Prognostic Index (IPI), PKC-beta expression was lowest in patients with low IPI scores (0-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within intermediate- and high-risk IPI groups, elevated PKC-beta expression was associated with worse survival, suggesting that PKC-beta may expand the prognostic value of the IPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results of global gene expression analyses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> samples corroborate previous observations that anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, cell proliferation, and B-cell proliferation signaling pathways are functionally related to PKC-beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We present a first detailed pharmacogenomics report comparing PKC-beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression across different lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and evaluating it as an outcome predictor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> patients with elevated PKC-beta have a worse prognosis, indicating that further evaluation of PKC-beta as a chemotherapeutic target for lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> is warranted </plain></SENT>
