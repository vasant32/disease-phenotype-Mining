<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the neoplastic counterpart of germinal center B cells, typically recapitulates a follicular architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several observations point to the crucial role of the cellular microenvironment in the development and/or progression of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to characterize the spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in vitro, and the modulation of this <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by follicular dendritic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a cell line derived from follicular dendritic cells to model the functional interactions of these cells and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in co-culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were isolated from tissue biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was quantified by flow cytometry and apoptotic pathways were investigated by western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in vitro involves the activation of caspases-3 and -8 but not of caspase-9, occurs despite persistent high levels of BCL-2 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>-1, and is associated with down-regulation of c-FLIP(L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells is partially prevented by co-culture with the follicular dendritic cells, which prevents activation of caspase-8, caspase-3 and induces an upregulation of c-FLIP(L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using neutralizing antibodies, we demonstrated that interactions involving CD54 (ICAM-1), CD106 (VCAM-1) and CD40 are implicated in this biological process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Follicular dendritic cells constitute a useful tool to study the functional interactions between follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and follicular dendritic cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in these protective interactions may lead to the identification of therapeutic agents that might suppress the survival and growth of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
