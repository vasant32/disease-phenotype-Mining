<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty frail patients (median age, 73 years), as defined by Balducci et al., with diffuse large B cell or grade IIIb follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, either at diagnosis (15 patients) or relapsed (five patients), were prospectively enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine out of 20 (45%) had a World Health Organisation (WHO) performance status &gt; or =2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen out of 20 patients (75%) had an International Prognostic Index (IPI) score &gt; or =3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen out of 20 (65%) evaluable patients obtained a complete response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five additional patients (25%) achieved a partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 24 months (range 18-27), 15/18 responding patients (83%) are alive and disease free, as well as 3/18 are alive with active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was mainly hematological with grade 3/4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in 26% of cycles and febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, 3/20 patients presented a grade III-IV WHO toxicity (one fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, one congestive, and one ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>) while receiving R-COMP chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, R-COMP-21 is an effective regimen with promising response rates for frail and elderly patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
