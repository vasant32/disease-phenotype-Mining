<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The use of differential counting on H &amp; E stained sections is proposed as a simple means to define low grade malignant and high grade malignant cytologic categories in non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Differential counts were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> biopsies from 616 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In each biopsy we counted 100 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and classified each cell as belonging to a "small", "medium-sized", or "large" cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results indicate the presence of two prognostically distinct cytologic categories: a low grade and a high grade malignant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphomas</z:hpo> with less than 10% "large" cells represented low grade malignant cytology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Included in this category were also the, mainly follicular, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with more then 70% "medium-sized" cells (up to about 25% "large" cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to the cytologic category, the architectural pattern is of major prognostic importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We recommend the use of three prognostic categories in non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>: I) Favourable architecture + favourable cytology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>II) Unfavourable architecture + favourable cytology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>III) Unfavourable cytology </plain></SENT>
