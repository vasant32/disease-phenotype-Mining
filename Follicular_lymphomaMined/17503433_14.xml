<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to asses the safety profile and clinical activity of rituximab in combination with fludarabine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> in patients with recurrent follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was a noncomparative, multicenter, phase II study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between March 2000 and December 2002, 54 patients with recurrent FL were enrolled in the FC+R trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received fludarabine at a dose of 25 mg/m(2) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> at a dose of 300 mg/m(2) daily for 3 consecutive days, every 3 weeks for 4 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rituximab was administered at a dose of 375 mg/m(2) beginning 2 weeks after the first course of fludarabine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and then on Day 1 of each cycle thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The planned treatment duration was 10 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 92% of patients completed the planned therapy in 10 to 14 weeks and 74% achieved a complete response (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients with BCL2-positive bone marrow, 86% obtained a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">molecular disease</z:e> remission (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median survival from treatment (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SFT</z:e>), the duration of disease remission (DR), and time to disease progression (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) had not been reached after a median follow-up of 45 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the baseline characteristics, &gt;2 previous treatments, BCL2-positive bone marrow, and low Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) score were found to be associated with better DR and/or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hematologic toxicity was transient and reversible, with the exception of 3 patients with severe and prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three patients presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, 1 of whom died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006285" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bronchopneumonia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The FC+R scheme, a nonanthracycline-containing regimen lasting up to 10 weeks, was found to be relatively well-tolerated and demonstrated significant antilymphoma activity with excellent clinical CR and molecular response rates </plain></SENT>
