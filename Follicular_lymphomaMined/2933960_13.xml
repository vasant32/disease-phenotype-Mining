<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This report describes the experience of the Southeastern <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Study Group (SECSG) with the frozen-section immunoperoxidase phenotyping of 162 cases of B-lineage non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors used a panel of 13 different markers with varying degrees of specificity for B lymphocytes and B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were classified according to the International Working Formulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several antibodies, including anti-immunoglobulin, B1, Leu 12, and Leu 14 were B-cell-specific markers that were generally pan-reactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several other monoclonal antibodies, however, were selectively reactive with subpopulations of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three "selective-B" antigens (BA1, p24, CALLA) were found on about half of the B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> tested, while another three (HB31, transferrin receptor, C3d receptor) were found on about two-thirds of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Leu 1 reacted with 18% of the B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, particularly the small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the reactivity of the monoclonal antibodies was compared with the histologic classification, two important points became apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>First, with the large panel of antibodies, there was tremendous phenotypic diversity even among histologically similar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Second, however, not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> possible combinations of antibody phenotypes were encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>That is, clusters of antigenic phenotypes were seen, and these phenotypes correlated to some degree with the histologic diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Small lymphocytic and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> tended to be phenotypically distinct, although there was some overlap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Intermediate- and high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were phenotypically more diverse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The more common phenotypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> encountered could not be reconciled with any simple linear scheme of neoplastic B-cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
