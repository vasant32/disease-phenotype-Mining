<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Quantitative flow cytometry (QFCM) is being applied in the clinical flow cytometry laboratory for diagnosis, prognosis, and assessment of patients receiving antibody-based therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ABC values and the effect of technical variables on CD22 quantitation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FCL), hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (HCL) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The QuantiBrite SystemÂ® was used to determine the level of CD22 expression (mean antibody bound per cell, ABC) by malignant and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intra-assay variability, number of cells required for precision, effect of delayed processing as well as shipment of peripheral blood specimens (delayed processing and exposure to noncontrolled environments), and the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31962">paraformaldehyde</z:chebi> fixation on assay results were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The QuantiBRITE method of measuring CD22 ABC is precise (median CV 1.6%, 95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.3%) but a threshold of 250 malignant cells is required for reliable CD22 ABC values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Delayed processing and overnight shipment of specimens resulted in significantly different ABC values whereas fixation for up to 12 h had no significant effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ABC measurements determined that CD22 expression is lower than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in ALL, CLL, FCL, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> but higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in HCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CD22 expression was atypical in the hematolymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> studied and may have diagnostic utility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Technical variables such as cell number analyzed and delayed processing or overnight shipment of specimens impact significantly on the measurement of antigen expression by QFCM in the clinical laboratory </plain></SENT>
