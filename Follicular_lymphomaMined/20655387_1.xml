<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report one of the longest follow-ups to a prospective transplantation study in such diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On a phase II study, 80 patients with low-grade, transformed, or mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> received ABMT with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) purging as part of initial or salvage therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses included nontransformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 63% and transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With 16.6-year median follow-up for survival, actuarial 10-year EFS and overall survival (OS) were 34% (95% confidence interval [CI], 25%-46%) and 45% (35%-57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median EFS and OS were 3.0 and 8.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early nonrelapse mortality incidence was 8%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> incidence was 4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most relapses occurred within 3 years, with a median time to diagnosis of relapse of 1.8 years (range: 0.1-15.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, age &gt;50 years, â‰¥3 prior chemotherapy regimens, and ABMT after relapse were associated with significantly inferior survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (19%) were event-free &gt;15 years after transplantation, raising the possibility of a plateau in the progression-free survival curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, 4-HC-purged ABMT can produce extended remissions in a subgroup of patients with indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
