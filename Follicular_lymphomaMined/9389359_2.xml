<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a series of 37 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> with 3q27 structural chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Breakpoints at 3q27, the site of the bcl-6 gene, appear in a broad range of B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> histologies but are most frequently detected in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> lacking a t(14;18) and diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The majority of 3q27 rearrangements result from translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy or light chain genes, however, involvement of other partner chromosomes is also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Molecular rearrangement of bcl-6 is demonstrable in a subset of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bcl-6 is a recently identified gene encoding a zinc-finger protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is normally expressed in germinal center B cells where it is believed to have a developmental or differentiation function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional deregulation of bcl-6 through translocations, submicroscopic molecular rearrangements or point mutations may be responsible for this gene's putative lymphomagenic potential </plain></SENT>
