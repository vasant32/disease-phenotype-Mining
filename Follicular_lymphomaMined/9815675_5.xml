<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This rearrangement can serve as a sensitive marker for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to assess the molecular complete response rate of stages I-III follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to central lymphatic irradiation (CLI) by detection of PCR-amplifiable bcl-2 MBR rearrangement in the bone marrow and peripheral blood before and after CLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients with stages I-III follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were treated with CLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve of them were part of a prospective randomization trial comparing CLI with multi-agent chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples were obtained from the patients before the initiation of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By using the PCR technique, the DNA sequences from the bone marrow and peripheral blood samples that flank the bcl-2 MBR involved in t(14;18) (q32;q21) were amplified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In PCR-positive patients, bone marrow and blood samples were followed at regular intervals during and after CLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of the PCR amplification were correlated with clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 20 patients achieved clinical complete response after CLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 22 months (range, 12-37 months), and no patient has relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment PCR results were available in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (19 patients for peripheral blood samples and 16 patients for bone marrow samples) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nine of 19 peripheral blood samples and 9 of 16 bone marrow samples were PCR-positive for bcl-2 MBR rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Eight PCR-positive patients converted to negative (8 of 9 blood samples and 2 of 3 bone marrow samples) 2-20 months from the first day of CLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow and peripheral blood with PCR-amplifiable bcl-2 MBR rearrangement can be converted from positive to negative after chemotherapy in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Early results from our study show for the first time that peripheral blood and bone marrow can be converted from positive to negative after CLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The prognostic significance of the observed conversions requires longer follow-up </plain></SENT>
