<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hundred and twenty-one patients with FL who were treated with various <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy regimens were included in this retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with FL3 and a diffuse component of &gt;50% had the worst outcome, with a hazard ratio of dying of 2.2 (95% CI 1.4-3.4) compared with patients with FL1 or FL2, and a ratio of 1.6 (95% CI 1.02-2.5) compared with FL3 with a diffuse component of &lt; or =50% by multivariate analysis (P = 0.0026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with FL3a had an outcome similar to those with FL3b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with FL3 and a diffuse component of &lt; or =50%, the overall and event-free survival curves showed a plateau for patients younger than 60 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there were no differences in the cumulative incidence of relapse/progression or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-specific/treatment-related mortality between the two age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Less than half of the patients with FL3 and a diffuse component of &lt; or =50% treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based combination chemotherapy will relapse and relapses are uncommon after 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Older patients should be offered the same aggressive chemotherapy as younger patients </plain></SENT>
