<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) is not a single disease, but a group of closely related B- and T-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> of the lymphatic system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of NHL is rising, particularly in the countries of the industrialized world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The increased incidence is poorly understood, but several risk factors have been postulated to be associated with NHL, including: exposure to chemicals, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, organ transplantation and blood transfusion, family history, and lifestyle factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Precise staging of NHL is a prerequisite for the selection of a suitable therapeutic regimen and influences the likelihood of its success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Staging of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is traditionally conducted using <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biopsy, imaging (X-ray, computerized tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging, lymphangiogram, <z:chebi fb="29" ids="49631">gallium</z:chebi> scan using 67 Ga <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT [ 67 Ga-SPECT], or <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography), blood tests, bone marrow examination, and examination of cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT is the most commonly used imaging technique, but several studies indicate that other techniques, such as 67 Ga-SPECT, are more sensitive and better predictors of response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low- and high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> differ markedly in prognosis and response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The management of NHL has been characterized by the increasing recognition that distinct subgroups of NHL respond differently to various therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), a successful approach has been to combine fludarabine with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> (FM), resulting in an overall response rate of 89% (67% complete remission) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In an ongoing phase III trial in patients with untreated, advanced, low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, FM was compared with CHOP (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>) with or without rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients previously treated with FM achieved a significantly better complete remission rate (67% v 38%; P = .0013) and a better molecular remission (36% v 20%; P = .049) than patients previously treated with CHOP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Following rituximab treatment, 88% of patients who had received FM achieved clinical and molecular remission compared with 70% who had received CHOP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Strategies using various chemotherapy combinations, including innovative agents such as 90 Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan, show promise in the treatment of NHL, particularly indolent NHL, and hopefully will lead to an improvement in prognosis </plain></SENT>
