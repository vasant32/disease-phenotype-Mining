<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients were first seen at the Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, during the 8-year period 1975-82 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 27 patients (9.2%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) and 267 with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age at presentation was younger for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> (45 years) and the male: female ratio was higher (2:1) than the corresponding figures for NHL of 51 years and 1.4:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 76 patients (28.5% of NHL), the disease was thought to have originated in an extra-nodal site, 48 of these cases being gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was possible to reclassify 234 NHL according to the Rappaport and Kiel classifications, and the Working Formulation (WF) proposed by the US National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute Study; for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>, the Rye classification was used in 26 cases where suitable material was available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nodular/follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> made up 17.1% of nodal NHL and 5.3% of extra-nodal NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The "histiocytic" (Rappaport) or large-cell (WF) subtype was the commonest amongst diffuse NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were only four cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>, the nodular sclerosing subtype was commonest in females (5 out of 8 cases) and for males, the commonest was mixed cellularity (10 out of 18 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of patients with nodal NHL 64.7%, presented with Stage IV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>, there were about equal numbers of patients presenting with Stage II and Stage IV disease (10 and 9 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The low incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is comparable to figures from other "oriental" countries such as Japan </plain></SENT>
