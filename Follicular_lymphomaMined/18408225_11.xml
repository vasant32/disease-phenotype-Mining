<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Personal use of hair dye has been inconsistently linked to risk of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), perhaps because of small samples or a lack of detailed information on personal hair-dye use in previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study included 4,461 NHL cases and 5,799 controls from the International <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Epidemiology Consortium 1988-2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased risk of NHL (odds ratio (OR) = 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1, 1.4) associated with hair-dye use was observed among women who began using hair dye before 1980 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses by NHL subtype showed increased risk for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e>) but not for other NHL subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increased risks of FL (OR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.9) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e> (OR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.0) were mainly observed among women who started using hair dyes before 1980 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For women who began using hair dye in 1980 or afterward, increased FL risk was limited to users of dark-colored dyes (OR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that personal hair-dye use may play a role in risks of FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e> in women who started use before 1980 and that increased risk of FL among women who started use during or after 1980 cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
