<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Somatic hypermutation of the BCL6 gene and its expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> represent specific markers for B-cell transit through the germinal center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, analysis of BCL6 may aid in clarifying the relationship between primary mediastinal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (PMBL) and other non-thymic diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DLCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-four PMBL were analyzed for BCL6 status, including first intron mutations, by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also performed a meta-analysis of reported BCL6 mutations in PMBL (n=141), DLCL (n=233), and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=120) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen PMBL (54%) showed hypermutation of BCL6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases showed bcl6 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and immunohistochemical expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis demonstrated that the preferentially altered sequence motifs of BCL6 in PMBL were TA (p=0.002) and AT (p=0.0008) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> and TAT trinucleotides (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GC and RGYW/WRCY motifs were a target in DLCL and FL but not in PMBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the DNA stretch spanning <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> 150-270 was highly targeted only in PMBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The consistent expression of bcl6 protein and occurrence of hypermutation indicate that PMBL should be considered of germinal center origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The fact that the hypermutation sites and mutational spectrum of BCL6 in PMBL differ from those found in FL and DLCL might suggest that the maturation block of the transforming cells differs among these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types, and that the characteristic mutational pattern is present before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, our findings strengthen the hypothesis that PMBL originate from an already defined sub-population of B-cells, which are different from those leading to either DLCL or FL </plain></SENT>
