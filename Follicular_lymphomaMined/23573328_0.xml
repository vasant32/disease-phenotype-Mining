<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is defined by two or three recurrent chromosome translocations; MYC/8q24 loci, usually in combination with the t (14; 18) (q32; q21) bcl-2 gene or/and BCL6/3q27 chromosomal translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DHL was often observed both in de-novo diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is otherwise unclassifiable, showing features intermediate that of large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we present two follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients; one transformed to THL, another transformed to DHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both cases revealed aggressive clinical courses with poor prognosis and associated with acquisition of c-Myc gene (MYC) and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the related literature, correlated the immunophenotype and clinical manifestations such as response to therapy and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the incidence of DHT and THL is low, cytogenetic and FISH analyses should be included when B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients experience relapse or refractory course of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We concluded that c-Myc may contribute to aggressive transformation, and more mechanism-based therapy should be explored </plain></SENT>
