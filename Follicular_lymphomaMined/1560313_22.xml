<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>B-Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of extranodal origin, and in particular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> derived from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), were compared with node-based <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of follicular and diffuse <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic techniques were supplemented by molecular analysis using probes which recognize both the major and the minor breakpoint regions of the bcl-2 gene located on chromosome 18 (q21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>t(14;18) was detected in 55 per cent of follicular and 27 per cent of diffuse B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> thought to be of follicle centre cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetics and molecular analysis proved equally effective in demonstrating the translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>t(14;18) was not observed in the 36 extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> examined, of which 20 were characterized histologically as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of MALT, using either technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, 30 cases demonstrated only a germline band when probed with a bcl-3 probe specific for t(14;19), a translocation observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (CLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, although no consistent abnormality was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Numerical abnormalities of chromosomes 3, 6, 16, and 18; structural abnormalities of chromosomes 2, 6, 8, and 9; and small marker chromosomes were frequently seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study provides data which suggest that different genetic events are involved in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of MALT from those giving rise to follicle centre cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
