<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because TNF-α polymorphisms that increase TNF-α production are associated with an increased risk of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), we hypothesized that increased levels of household endotoxin would be associated with an increased NHL risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated this association in the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute/Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (NCI/SEER) NHL multicenter population-based case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Used vacuum cleaner bags were collected from participants during a home interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dust samples from the bags of 594 cases and 442 controls were analyzed for endotoxin [endotoxin unit (EU)/mg of dust] using the kinetic chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of endotoxin on NHL risk adjusted for age, sex, race, education, study center, and farm exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endotoxin was not associated with NHL overall [odds ratio (OR) for highest quartile of endotoxin levels = 0.81, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.55, 1.20; p for trend = 0.35] or with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR = 0.63, 95 % CI = 0.34, 1.16; p = 0.31) or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR = 1.07, 95 % CI = 0.61, 1.89; p = 0.73) subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both working and living on a farm were associated with higher household endotoxin levels compared to never working (p = 0.009) or living (p = 0.01) on a farm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Excluding farmers from the analysis did not change the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of a role for household endotoxin in NHL etiology </plain></SENT>
