<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy and toxicity of first-line single-agent rituximab, followed by re-treatment with rituximab at 6-month intervals, in previously untreated patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) or small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-four previously untreated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e> received rituximab 375 mg/m2 weekly for 4 consecutive weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were required to have one or more indications for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with objective response or stable disease continued to receive identical 4-week rituximab courses at 6-month intervals, for a total of four courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The objective response rate after the first course of rituximab was 51% (4% complete responses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients received one or more additional courses of rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At present, the overall response rate is 58%, with 9% complete responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 20 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) time was 18.6 months, and the 1- and 2-year PFS rates were 62% and 49%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment was well tolerated, with only two episodes of grade 3 to 4 infusion-related toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No cumulative toxicity or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">opportunistic infections</z:e> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Single-agent rituximab, used at a standard dose and schedule, is active in the first-line treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e>, producing substantially higher response rates than previously reported in relapsed or refractory patients (51% v 13%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Re-treatment with rituximab at 6-month intervals is well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The PFS time of 18.6 months in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e> seems shorter than the 36- to 40-month median PFSs previously reported with first-line plus maintenance rituximab in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Additional follow-up is required to fully assess the impact of this treatment strategy </plain></SENT>
