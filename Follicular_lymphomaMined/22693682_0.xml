<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cytologic diagnosis of B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> composed of small-/intermediate-sized cells, however, has been seen as an area of great difficulty even for experienced observers due to the morphologic overlap between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathies</z:hpo> as well as between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> entities themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although ancillary testing has improved diagnostic accuracy, the results from these tests must be interpreted within the morphological and clinical context to avoid misinterpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the recognition of specific cytologic features is crucial in guiding the appropriate selection of ancillary tests which will either confirm or refute a tentative diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For these reasons, we here review the cytologic characteristics particular to five common B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> which typically cause the most diagnostic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> based on cytological assessment alone: marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We summarize the most pertinent cytomorphologic features for each entity as well as for reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp>, contrast them with each other to facilitate their recognition, and highlight common diagnostic pitfalls </plain></SENT>
