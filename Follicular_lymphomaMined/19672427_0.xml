<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> patients frequently use alternative therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients who had objective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> regression after taking Devil's Claw without cytotoxic therapy are reported here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patient 1 presented with coexistent immunoglobulin G <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1136084" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">plasma cell dyscrasia</z:e> and stage iiia <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (nodes 5 cm in diameter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography scan 10 months later showed partial regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On enquiry, it was learned that the patient was taking Devil's Claw and Essiac (Essiac Products Services, Pompano Beach, FL, U.S.A.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This patient later developed overt <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp>, at which time he stopped the herbal supplements and underwent high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation, since which no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> progression has occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient 2 presented with stage IIIA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (nodes 2.5 cm in diameter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>He learned of patient 1 through our <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patient support group and started Devil's Claw </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography scan 11 months later showed decreased <z:mp ids='MP_0000702'>adenopathy</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, which has been sustained for 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Devil's Claw tuberous root has anti-inflammatory properties, probably through suppression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There are no prior reports of anticancer activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of COX-2 has a role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> prevention, has been implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e>, and is associated both with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> stage and with response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, spontaneous regression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has been reported in 16% of patients in one series, of whom none were on herbal medications or COX-2 inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The key issue in both these patients is whether disease regression was "spontaneous" or causally related to therapy with Devil's Claw </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The timing of the response suggests a positive effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further investigation is warranted, preferably with a COX-2 inhibitor of known purity </plain></SENT>
