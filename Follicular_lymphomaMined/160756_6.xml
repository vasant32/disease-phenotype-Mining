<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine cases of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were studied by the enzyme histochemical method and membrane surface markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Strong <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> triphosphatase (ATPase) activity was demonstrated in 15 cases of 20 B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and in one case of null-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1/1) by a light- and electron-microscopic enzyme histochemical method according to Wachstein et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neoplastic cells in nodules of 2 nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (0/2) and in 8 cases of T <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (0/8) did not show any ATPase activity enzyme-histochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ATPase activity of B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was electron-microscopically demonstrated on the plasma membrane of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells but not in the cytoplasmic organelles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The specificity of ATPase activity in B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was also examined enzyme-histochemically with reference to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such specificity was similar to that of non-neoplastic B lymphocytes of primary follicles and the mantle zone of secondary follicles in lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, ATPase is one of the useful enzyme histochemical markers in differentiating T and B subclasses of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
