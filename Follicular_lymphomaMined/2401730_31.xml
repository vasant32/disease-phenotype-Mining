<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The highest incidence of disease (83%) was seen in small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>) and the lowest (19%) in diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among cases with positive marrows, disease was bilateral in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 15 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e> but in only 10 of 20 (50%) of the DLCL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 30 of 99 (30%) positive marrows disease was unilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were strongly associated with a paratrabecular pattern, with 40 of 45 positive cases showing this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Discordant histology was seen in six of 20 positive cases of DLCL and two of 37 positive cases of follicular small cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FSCCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A bone marrow aspirate was positive in only 56 of the 99 (57%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peripheral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1533163" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood disease</z:e> was present in 15% of the bone marrow positive cases and in 6% of the cases overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of marrow disease varies with the histological subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The paratrabecular pattern is associated with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and bilateral biopsy specimens increase the positivity rate in most subtypes of NHL </plain></SENT>
