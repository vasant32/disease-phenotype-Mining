<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A new anti-CD22 recombinant immunotoxin RFB4(dsFv)-PE38, composed of the Fv portion of the monoclonal antibody RFB4 fused to a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin A, is being developed to target CD22+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To explore the potential clinical utility of this recombinant toxin in treating patients with B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, the fresh cells of patients were incubated ex vivo with RFB4(dsFv)-PE38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specific cytotoxicity was demonstrated in the malignant cells of 25 of 28 patients with a variety of B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo> and large cell, mantle cell, and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The IC50S, the concentrations necessary for 50% inhibition of protein synthesis, were 3-10 ng/ml in five patients and 10-50 ng/ml in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity correlated with cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> upon direct examination of the malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant cytotoxicity was observed with cells containing as few as 350 CD22 sites/cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A more active derivative of RFB4(dsFv)-PE38, RFB4(dsFv)-PE38KDEL, was produced and was slightly to more than 10-fold more cytotoxic toward patient cells and about twice as toxic to mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, RFB4(dsFv)-PE38 was specifically cytotoxic toward malignant cells from patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data support the testing of RFB4(dsFv)-PE38 in patients with CD22+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, which is presently under way </plain></SENT>
