<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Improvements to the efficacy of this regimen can be made by increasing the doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, as in the chemotherapeutic regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36373">vindesine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (ACVBP), and by reducing the standard dosing interval, as seen with the CHOP-14 regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adding the immunotherapeutic agent rituximab (R) to either CHOP or ACVBP has been shown to improve outcomes significantly, such that six cycles of R-CHOP plus two cycles of ritux-imab are as effective as eight cycles of R-CHOP, and R-CHOP-21 appears to be at least as effective as the more dose-intense R-CHOP-14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients who have several adverse prognostic factors, R-ACVBP plus autologous stem-cell transplantation has been shown to produce good treatment outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The use of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography scanning before and early in treatment should allow prediction of long-term outcomes, and therefore the adaptation of treatment to individual prognosis and treatment needs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, rituximab has been shown to improve the efficacy of conventional chemotherapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, rituximab alone or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">yttrium</z:chebi>-90-ibritumomab tiuxetan are effective maintenance therapies in this condition </plain></SENT>
