<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The association of recurrent chromosomal abnormalities with certain types of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHLs) provides important clues to their classification and pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The t(11;14), an uncommon abnormality, has been reported in a variety of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including the intermediately differentiated lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (IDLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors report here the histologic, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic findings in four additional patients with such translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They represent 8% of 51 patients with NHL studied by cytogenetics in a provincial hospital of Western mainland Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of the patients had IDLL and one a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of large cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings strengthen the association between t(11;14) and IDLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the occurrence of t(11;14) in a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, as the sole abnormality, along with histogenetic considerations, suggests the possible existence of a rarer subset of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, not associated with the t(14;18) and histogenetically related to IDLL </plain></SENT>
