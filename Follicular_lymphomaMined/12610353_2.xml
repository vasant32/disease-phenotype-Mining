<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the incidence of MUC-1 mucin expression and its clinical significance in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, we investigated a panel of 113 cases by immunohistochemistry (IHC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MUC-1 mucin expression was detected in the majority of cases (92.9%), with moderate to high levels noted in 50.4% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> histologic subsets comprising <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (82 cases), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) (15 cases), FL with transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (4 cases), and other B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (12 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant correlation was found between MUC-1 mucin expression and MUC1 genomic status (amplification/rearrangement) evaluated by Southern blot analysis, and 1q21 abnormality by karyotypic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, MUC-1 mucin expression correlated with a previous history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
