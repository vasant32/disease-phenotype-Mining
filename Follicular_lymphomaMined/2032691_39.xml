<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied 36 cases of monocytoid B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (MBCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We confirm the predilection for females (30 of 36; ratio, five women to one man) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age was 65 years (range, 29 to 85 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Monocytoid B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> characteristically involves peripheral lymph nodes (30 of 36) with a propensity for paraparotid or intraparotid nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Salivary glands were affected in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other extranodal sites of involvement included breast, thyroid, stomach, and soft tissue of chest wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients manifested with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sj√∂gren's syndrome</z:e>, one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, one presented initially with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e>, and two had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1136085" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">monoclonal gammopathy</z:e>. "Composite <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>" were encountered in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, association with or progression to a higher-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, ie, mixed small and large cell (one) and large cell (six), was observed in seven patients and was associated with a more <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behavior</z:hpo> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies performed on biopsy sections from 20 patients confirmed the B-cell nature of MBCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An average reactivity of less than 10% of the monocytoid B cells with the proliferation marker Ki-67 was demonstrated, in keeping with the indolent behavior of MBCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite our observation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> frequently accompanying MBCL, the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation does not appear to play a pathogenetic role for MBCL, as determined by molecular studies for the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation and immunologic studies for the BCL2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our observations also provide support for the proposal that there is an overlap between MBCL and "MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>" (those arising from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) </plain></SENT>
