<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is a low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) that frequently transforms into diffuse aggressive NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of FLs display a t(14; 18) translocation that places the bcl-2 gene into juxtaposition with the lg heavy-chain (H) gene locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Morphologically transformed malignant FL cells retain their t(14;18) translocation and may acquire additional genetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed serial biopsy specimens from eight patients with FL for secondary alterations of the rearranged bcl-2 gene in the breakpoint and open reading frame (ORF) regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two cases of FL showed no histologic alteration in the second biopsy, and six cases of FL showed morphologic transformation to diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLL) in the second biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, cloning, and sequencing of the junctional region of the hybrid bcl-2/IgH genes showed identical nucleotide sequences in multiple biopsy specimens of FL that did not show morphologic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients in whom FL cells underwent morphologic transformation, FL and autologous DLL cells displayed identical bcl-2/IgH gene nucleotide sequences in five cases and different sequences in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the case for which FL and DLL cells showed different bcl-2/IgH junctional sequences, DLL cells incorporated larger bcl-2 and Ig-joining (JH) gene fragments than the corresponding FL cells, suggesting that DLL clones developed by a distinct t(14; 18) translocation rather than by alteration of the hybrid bcl-2/IgH gene detected in the FL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight cases, neither FL nor DLL cells showed alterations of bcl-2 gene sequences in the breakpoint region, suggesting high conservation of the bcl-2 gene during both t(14; 18) translocation and morphologic transformation of the FL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PCR single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and sequence analyses were performed for identification of structural alterations of the bcl-2 gene in the ORF region corresponding to the 239-amino acid p26-bcl-2 alpha protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A total of 11 point mutations of the ORF were detected in DLL cells of three transformed NHLs, but no alteration of the ORF was detected in FL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four of 11 mutations, at positions 29, 46, 59, and 106, yielded amino acid replacements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that FL and DLL cells may be clonally related or unrelated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>They also show that transformation of FL cells may be associated with somatic point mutations of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene ORF sequence resulting in alteration of the p26-bcl-2 alpha gene product </plain></SENT>
