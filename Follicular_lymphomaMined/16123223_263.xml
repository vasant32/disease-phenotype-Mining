<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Phase 2 studies suggest that the monoclonal antibody rituximab may improve the prognosis of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) when it is added to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, 428 patients with untreated, advanced-stage FL were randomly assigned for therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHOP) alone (n = 205) or CHOP combined with rituximab (R-CHOP) (n = 223) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>R-CHOP reduced the relative risk for treatment failure by 60% and significantly prolonged the time to treatment failure (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, a significantly higher overall response rate (96% vs 90%; P = .011) and a prolonged duration of remission (P = .001) were achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In spite of a relatively short observation time, these beneficial effects even translated to superior overall survival (P = .016), with 6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the R-CHOP group compared with 17 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the CHOP group within the first 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The predominant treatment-related adverse effect was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo> was more frequently observed after R-CHOP (63% vs 53%; P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were rare and of similar frequency after R-CHOP and CHOP (5% and 7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hence, adding rituximab to CHOP significantly improves the outcome for patients with previously untreated advanced-stage FL and does not induce major adverse effects </plain></SENT>
