<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The findings were compared with the histological diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall Ki-67 positivity is not always a good measure of the corresponding corrected values and therefore we recommend that a correction should be made for the total number of complementary lymphocytes in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Taking the macrophages and the Ki-67 positivity of the reactive cells into account does not generally add any information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in reactive cell content between follicular (counted within follicles) and diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The value of the group mean for low-grade follicular (nodular) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was significantly higher than that of diffuse low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, but not significantly different from that of intermediate-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> exhibited significantly greater Ki-67 positivity than those of intermediate grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 76% of the cases there was significant agreement between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> grade (low/intermediate malignant versus high malignant) at 45% corrected Ki-67 counts </plain></SENT>
