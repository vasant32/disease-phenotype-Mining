<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In efforts to find novel approaches to inhibit proliferation and induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in FL cells, we examined the action of naturally occurring compound <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> in the three recently established FL cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cytotoxic effects and determination of apoptotic attributes upon <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> treatment were analyzed using growth inhibition, [(3)H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi>, fluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry assays, as well as Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chemical inhibitor studies for the assessment of caspase and cathepsin contribution were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of 10 members of the bcl-2 family proteins was evaluated by immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> inhibited proliferation and growth, and induced profound <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> associated with a shift in the balance of the bcl-2 family proteins, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, we observed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>-induced caspase-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is also associated with lysosomal rupture (LMP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An increase in intracellular ROS generation appeared critical for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>-evoked LMP, loss of Deltapsi(m,) caspase activation, and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, as well as <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi>-mediated enhancement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>'s action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated for the first time that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> is an efficient inducer of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in FL cell lines, meriting its further evaluation in vivo </plain></SENT>
