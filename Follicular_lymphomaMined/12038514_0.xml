<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the diagnosis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is based on histological study, the histology cannot be recommended for the follow-up of efficiency of treatment(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sensitive detection of the chimera genes in blood or bone marrow samples can serve as informative data without invasive sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, a single-tube multiplex reaction was developed for the simultaneous detection of different chimeras of the bcl2 and immunoglobulin heavy chain genes, molecular hallmarks of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The method was optimized for the highest yield of reaction and for reproducing the ratio of components in artificial mixtures of two different chimeras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The method is suitable for fast and accurate molecular characterization of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and for follow-up of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
