<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The percentage of Leu-1+ T cells in the follicles of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (20 per cent) was virtually identical to that seen in the follicles of nonneoplastic lymph nodes or tonsils (22 per cent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 50 per cent T cells in the interfollicular regions of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 75 per cent in the paracortical regions of the nonneoplastic specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In neoplastic follicles the number of Leu-3a+ cells was 67 per cent of the number of Leu-1+ cells, whereas, virtually the entire T-cell population in the nonneoplastic follicles expressed the Leu-3a antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These T cells of helper phenotype may facilitate the neoplastic process or an immune response against it or may be bystanders to the B-cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
