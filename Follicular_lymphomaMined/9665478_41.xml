<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In resting cells, the level of p27Kip1 provides an inhibitory threshold above which G1 cyclin D/E/cyclin-dependent kinases accumulate before activation; however, in cycling cells, p27Kip1 protein is sequestered by high levels of active cyclin D/cyclin-dependent kinase 4 complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a group, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors have been proposed to act as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes, and several members have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined p27Kip1 expression in 116 non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> including 50 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> (40 typical and 10 blastic variants), 21 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 20 diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 16 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo>, 8 marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and 1 splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and correlated its expression with that of the proliferation marker Ki67 (MiB1) and with p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>p27Kip1 gene structure was analyzed by Southern blot in the group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, p27Kip1 expression was inversely related to the proliferation index as measured by Ki67 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, p27Kip1 expression was negative in 35 of 40 (88%) cases, irrespective of the proliferative rate (median 15%; range 2 to 90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, in the blastic variant of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, 8 of 10 (80%) cases showed expression of p27Kip1, despite a high proliferation rate (median 60%; range 32 to 100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the staining in most of the cases was less intense than in the reactive T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Deletions of p27Kip1 gene were not found in any of the 25 cases examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>p53 expression was found in 15 of 50 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>: 7 of 10 (70%) in the blastic variant and 8 of 40 (20%) in the typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> (70% vs. 20%, P &lt; 0.0045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCLs</z:e>, in contrast to other non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid tissue, fail to correlate p27Kip1 expression with the proliferation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This peculiar uncoupling of p27Kip1 protein expression from the proliferation rate may be related to the high levels of cyclin D1 expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> and is likely to have profound effects on cell cycle regulation and contribute to the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
