<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was striking <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of bcl-2 content in a number of cases and the smaller neoplastic cells (i.e., centrocytes) were usually the most strongly labeled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In most cases, bcl-2 protein staining was much weaker in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid cells than in the neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In several cases, staining for bcl-2 revealed patterns of neoplastic cell spread into adjacent tissue (e.g., <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> follicles, lymphoid sinuses), and bcl-2 protein expression tended to be highest in these migratory cells </plain></SENT>
