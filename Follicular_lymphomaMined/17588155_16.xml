<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Interviews were completed with 1,321 cases ascertained from population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries in Seattle, Detroit, Los Angeles and Iowa, and with 1,057 frequency-matched controls, selected by random-digit dialing and from the Medicare files database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A history of any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0869403,C0700625,C0020517" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">allergy</z:e> (excluding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013182" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">drug allergies</z:e>), decreased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.7, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 0.6-1.0), diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>] (OR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.4-0.9), and follicular NHL (OR = 0.7, 95 CI = 0.5, 1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A similar effect was observed for hay <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>eczema</z:hpo> was associated with an increased risk of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.1-3.4), but not <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.6-2.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>Asthma</z:hpo> did not affect risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Youngest compared to oldest siblings had a 90% increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (95% CI = 1.2-3.1; p for trend with increasing birth order = 0.006), but not follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.6-1.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We infer that some childhood and immune-related factors may alter NHL risk </plain></SENT>
