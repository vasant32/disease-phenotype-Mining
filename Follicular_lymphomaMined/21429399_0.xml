<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical data of 126 B-NHL patients with bone marrow involvement diagnosed in our hospital were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chromosome banding analysis was performed after 24 h culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) The B-NHLs included were diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) 38.9% (49 cases), lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (LPL) 19% (24 cases), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) 16.7% (21 cases), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) 9.5% (12 cases), marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>) 8.7% (11 cases) and small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>) 7.1%(9 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) Chromosome aberrations (CA) were detected in 52 of 126 patients (41.3%) by conventional cytogenetics (CC), including clonal CA 38 cases, and non-clonal CA 14 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ploidy levels in 38 clonal CA cases were pseudodiploid (57.9%), hypodiploid (15.8%) and hyperdiploid (26.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of chromosomal abnormalities among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>, LPL, FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e> was 73.4%, 38.1%, 36.4%, 8.3%, 8.3% and 11.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(3) Clonal CA, CA more than two kinds, and CA of chromosomes 2, 3, 9, 11, 17, 18 and 20 were associated with shorter overall survival (OS) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More than two kinds of CA and CA of chromosome 3, 13 were associated with shorter OS in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of CA was higher in aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> than in indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complex CA were quite common, and some specific CA might have prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
