<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine whether differences in gene expression in FL tissue correlate with outcome in response to rituximab and CHOP (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>) chemotherapy (R-CHOP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We divided 24 patients into long- [time to treatment failure (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi>) &gt;35 months] and short-term (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi> &lt;23 months) responders, and analysed the gene expression profiles of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissue using oligonucleotide microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a supervised learning technique to identify genes correlating with outcome, and confirmed the expression of selected genes with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the transcripts with a high correlation between microarray and qPCR analyses, we identified EPHA1, a tyrosine kinase involved in transepithelial migration, SMAD1, a transcription factor and a mediator of bone morphogenetic protein and transforming growth factor-beta signalling, and MARCO, a scavenger receptor on macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to Kaplan-Meier estimates, high EPHA1, and low SMAD1 and MARCO expression were associated with better progression-free survival (PFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry showed that EphA1 was primarily localised in granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, both EphA1 and Smad1 were expressed in vascular endothelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no difference in vasculature was detected between long- and short-term responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a validation set of 40 patients, a trend towards a better PFS was observed among patients with high EphA1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that gene expression in non-malignant cells contributes to clinical outcome in R-CHOP-treated FL patients </plain></SENT>
