<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed the characteristics of clinical and pathological data for the 1248 NHL patients in the Shandong region of China between 2002 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 2002 to 2010, the number of clinical cases of NHL increased year by year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the total, 64.7% were B-cell NHL, 30.3% were T-cell NHL, including: diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) (40.9%), extranodal NK/T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, nasal type (NK/T) (10.0%); peripheral T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, unspecified (PTL) (9.2%); follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) (6.4%); extranodal marginal zone B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (MALT) (5.4%); precursor T lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (T-LBL) (4.5%); and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e>) (3.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> was 47.7 âˆ“ 16.3 (18-85), and the male to female ratio was 1.57:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with Shanghai and Shanxi in China, the proportion of NK/T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in this region was higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In comparison with other countries, the FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e> in this region were significantly lower, while the incidence of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was significantly higher than that in the United States and Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clinical and pathological distribution of NHL in Shandong region of China is consistent with that of Asian populations, but with significant difference from the Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The NK/T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in this region was significantly higher </plain></SENT>
