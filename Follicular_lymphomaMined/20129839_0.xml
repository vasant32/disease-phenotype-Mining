<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ultraviolet radiation (UVR), pigmentary characteristics have been linked with both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, and for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007114" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">skin cancer</z:e>, the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) which influences <z:hpo ids='HP_0001000'>pigmentation</z:hpo> has also been implicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper reports on the relationship between MC1R, skin, hair and eye colour, time spent outdoors, and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Persons carrying MC1R homozygote variant alleles at R151C, R160W, D294H and D84E were more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0007513'>fair skin</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002297'>red hair</z:hpo> and to spend less time outdoors than those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The variant allele at V92M was associated with FL (odds ratio (OR)=1.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-2.39) and the r:<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> genotype with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (OR=0.58, 95% CI 0.38-0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interactions between MC1R genotypes and skin colour influenced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> risk; the RR genotype increased risk in individuals with medium or dark skin, based on 5 cases and no controls, but decreased risk among those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0007513'>fair skin</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the whole, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and FL risk were not related to genetic variation in MC1R, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001000'>pigmentation</z:hpo> or time spent outdoors </plain></SENT>
