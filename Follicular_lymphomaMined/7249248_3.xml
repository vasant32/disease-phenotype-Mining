<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Forty previously untreated patients with either nodular poorly differentiated lymphocytic or nodular mixed lymphocytic/histiocytic non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were evaluated for length of survival from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complete remissions from initial therapy were achieved in 27/40 patients (67.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Actuarial analysis of survival shows that 83% of the complete responders from initial treatment are expected to be living at 7 years in contrast to a less than 2-year median survival of those who failed to reach complete remission with initial therapy when <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from nonlymphomatous causes are excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Wilcoxon comparison of these curves shows a significant (p = 0.0001) advantage for those who are able to attain a complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment was not implicated in any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of those patients not reaching complete remission from initial therapy, 80% of the survivors attained a complete response from other therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that complete remission attainment from initial chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival for patients with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, since combination chemotherapy has given higher complete remission rates than have single agents, such therapy offers the patient with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> the greatest chance for prolonged survival </plain></SENT>
