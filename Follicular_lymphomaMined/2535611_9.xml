<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reverse process, in which a less aggressive component becomes evident during the course of treatment for a higher-grade NHL, has only recently been recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> "downgrading" has been reported at the time of relapse in both radiation- and chemotherapy-treated patients who initially presented with high- or intermediate-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The etiology of this unusual transformation has not yet been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We present the clinical, morphologic, immunologic, and flow-cytometric features of a patient with diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who achieved a complete response to chemotherapy and then relapsed with follicular small-cleaved-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 3 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Morphologic and immunophenotypic findings suggest that both immunoblasts and small cleaved cells were present in the initial biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA content analysis of the initial and relapse biopsies suggests that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> component was more susceptible than the small cleaved cells to the chemotherapy that the patient received </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Successful eradication of the rapidly proliferating immunoblasts with survival of less rapidly proliferating small cleaved cells may account for the unusual histologic transformation seen in this case </plain></SENT>
