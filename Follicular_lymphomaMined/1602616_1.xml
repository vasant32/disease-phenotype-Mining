<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 49 years-old man presented with dry cough, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011134'>low grade fever</z:hpo>, and abnormal shadow on a chest X-ray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He had suffered from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the liver 5 years previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He received irradiation therapy in combination with chemotherapy for approximately three years and had been in complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physical and radiological examination revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo> and softly dense masses in the right lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The laboratory data were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He was diagnosed as having lymphomatoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e>) by open lung biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lung lesion was mainly infiltrated with T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient received <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> and the lung lesions disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, when a lung mass was noted two months later, he started to receive combination chemotherapy consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, adriamycin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> every three months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>He has not shown relapse of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e> so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To investigate the association between the preceding follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e> at this time, DNA analysis using the PCR technique was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e> lesion did not show a rearranged band for the JH probe, while the paraffin-embedded specimen of the preceding follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had shown rearranged band for the JH band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e> lesion, showed no rearrangement for TCR beta, gamma or JH probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e> was different from the preceding follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in terms of origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e> is considered to be induced in the immunosuppressive state due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
