<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in 10% to 15% of FL grade 1/2, immunohistochemical staining for BCL2 remains negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To analyze the incidence of BCL2 negativity and the underlying molecular mechanisms in FL grade 1/2, BCL2 expression was investigated with 3 antibodies (clones 100D5, E17, SP66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of a break in the BCL2 locus was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The region of the BCL2 gene where the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> of the standard BCL2 antibody resides was sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two (9.2%) of 240 identified cases of FL grade 1/2 were negative with the standard BCL2 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 12 cases (55%) carried a break in the BCL2 gene locus, which, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one case, correlated with BCL2 expression using the alternative antibodies E17 and SP66 and with missense mutations of BCL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten (45%) of the 22 cases had an intact BCL2 gene locus; 2 cases carried a BCL6/IGH translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 10 cases were negative for the E17/SP66 antibodies and showed a <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> sequence of BCL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six of these showed an aberrant phenotype, with CD10 negativity (30%) or CD23 expression (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, the alternative E17/SP66 antibodies identify 2 immunohistochemically and genetically distinct subgroups of BCL2-"negative" FL grade 1/2 </plain></SENT>
