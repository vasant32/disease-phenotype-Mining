<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No apparent restriction in the VH gene usage was found in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, lymphoplasmacytoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> or large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, whereas a biased VH1 utilization was shown in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 18 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> cases utilized the VH1 gene family, and nucleotide sequencing of the VH1 gene rearrangements revealed that a majority utilized the DP10 (51p1) germline gene, which has been reported to be strongly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No VH5 or VH6 rearrangements were amplified in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> subgroup, 2 gene families which previously have been found to be over-represented in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a high proportion (40%) of large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, VH gene family-specific PCR failed to amplify any rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using primers hybridizing to the framework regions 2 and 3 and Southern blot analysis of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, clonal rearrangements were displayed in two-thirds of these PCR negative cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the rearrangement status could not be elucidated in 5 of 35 patients with large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
