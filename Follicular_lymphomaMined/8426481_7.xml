<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The principal objective of this study was to investigate whether follicular center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> occur among B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used a molecular genetic/immunohistochemical approach and analysed 21 cases with the primary site in the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only two bcl-2 gene rearrangements were detected in our series and were found in two out of seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with a nodular growth pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A chromosomal translocation t(14;18) was demonstrated by comigration of rearranged bcl-2 and JH sequences in one of these two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed bcl-2 protein positive neoplastic follicles, CD10 expression, and lack of vimentin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these two cases were defined as follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the two follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of MALT, three other, nodular growing, bcl-2 protein positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were found to have no bcl-2 gene rearrangements, to be CD10 negative and to express vimentin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> might be composed of neoplastic extrafollicular cells which secondarily invaded reactive follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the presence of bcl-2 protein positive follicles is consistent with both a follicular and extrafollicular origin of a B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of MALT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the detection of a bcl-2 gene rearrangement is the most valuable criterion in such a situation, and additional immunophenotypic criteria, such as CD10 expression and lack of vimentin within the neoplastic population, further substantiate the diagnosis of a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in MALT </plain></SENT>
