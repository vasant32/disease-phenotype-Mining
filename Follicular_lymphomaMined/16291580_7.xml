<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also compared the profile with those of germinal center (GC) cells in reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002840'>lymphadenitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unsupervised clustering revealed a relatively homogeneous expression profile in HRS cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HRS cells tended to express mainly Th2 T cell-associated molecules rather than those of Th1, compared with GC cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-11 receptor alpha (IL-11Ralpha), a previously unknown HRS cell-specific gene, was detected in addition to known genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the expression of IL-11Ralpha at the protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only few cases were positive for IL-11Ralpha in B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first analysis report of tissue HRS cells with cDNA microarray technique </plain></SENT>
