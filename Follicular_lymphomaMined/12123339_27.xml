<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 90 patients were enrolled and treated with rituximab infusions at 375 mg/m2 once weekly for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Central pathology review revealed that histologically, 81 patients had indolent B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>: 59 with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 17 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, four with marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and one with lymphoplasmacytoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, four were ineligible due to violation of other eligibility criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatment variables affecting toxicities were analyzed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 90 patients, and those affecting response and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed for 77 eligible patients with confirmed indolent B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relationship between serum rituximab levels and efficacy was also analyzed for 66 eligible patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hematological toxicities (grade &gt; or =3) occurred more frequently in females (P &lt;0.05), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> were more frequent in patients with high <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (P &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Non-hematological toxicities (grade &gt; or =2) were more frequent in patients with extranodal disease or bone marrow involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate (ORR) in patients receiving one prior chemotherapy regimen was higher than those receiving two or more regimens (P &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median PFS was shorter in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> patients, in those with extranodal disease, or in those receiving two or more prior chemotherapy regimens (P &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The PFS intervals of patients with higher serum rituximab levels (&gt; or =70 microg/ml) immediately before the third infusion were longer than in other patients (P &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Several prognostic factors and serum rituximab levels are useful for predicting the toxicity and efficacy of rituximab monotherapy </plain></SENT>
