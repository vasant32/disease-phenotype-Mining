<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study analysed the morphologic differences between leukaemic mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, nodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we investigated the role of cyclin D1 expression in B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The morphologic analysis of the leukaemic cells was performed on cytocentrifuge preparations after separation of mononuclear cells from peripheral blood using a Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cyclin D1 protein expression was studied with the catalyzed signal amplification system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of other markers (CD5, CD23, light chain immunoglobulins) was analysed by the APAAP method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We describe in detail the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in eight patients with mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, six patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 11 patients with nodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and seven patients with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The morphological distinction between these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells is a challenge for the haematologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The investigation of cytocentrifuge preparations of mononuclear cells allows the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells also in cases with nondiagnostic white cell differential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the immunotype (light chain restriction, CD5, CD23, and cyclin D1) of 108 patients with leukaemic B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diffuse nuclear expression of cyclin D1 protein (&gt;20%) was specific for mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, only 6/8 patients showed cyclin-D1 positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The morphologic analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in cytocentrifuge preparations of mononuclear leukocytes in combination with immunocytochemical investigation allows the detection of mantle cells, centrocytes of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, marginal zone cells, and cells of the diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The positivity of cyclin D1 protein improves the differentiation of mantle cells from other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
