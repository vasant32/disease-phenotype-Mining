<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This hospital-based case-control study examined whether polymorphism in the DNA repair gene x-ray repair cross-complementing groups 1 (XRCC1 Arg194Trp [C--&gt;T], Arg280His [G--&gt;A], and Arg399Gln [G--&gt;A]) played a role in susceptibility to non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) in the Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We genotyped these polymorphisms for 221 histopathologically confirmed NHL cases and 254 age- and sex-matched healthy control cases in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No studied polymorphism alone was shown to be related to the risk of NHL or each histologic subtype of NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When stratified by smoking status, however, the XRCC1Arg399Gln variant genotypes (homozygotes and heterozygotes) were associated with a 3.0-fold risk of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> among heavy smokers (95% confidence interval: 1.16-7.82; P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further large-scale studies would confirm this association and clarify marginally significant trends in XRCC1 polymorphism combinations for an increased risk for NHL </plain></SENT>
