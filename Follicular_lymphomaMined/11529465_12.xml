<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) is widely used as salvage treatment for patients with relapsed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although SCT can induce prolonged remissions, it does not appear to be curative in the vast majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate if incorporation of SCT into first-line therapy can improve its efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five patients underwent sequential high-dose therapy as up-front (n=33) or salvage treatment (n=22) for advanced stage FL at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of intensive chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3423">carmustine</z:chebi> (BCNU), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, and melphalan (Dexa-BEAM) for mobilization of peripheral stem cells and reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> load, followed by one of three different myeloablative regimens and SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 4 years, projected event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) at 4 years post transplant was 59% and 84%, respectively, with no evidence of plateau in the survival curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By univariate and multivariate analysis weighing age, sex, stage, BM and extranodal involvement, timing of transplant, ex vivo purging, and conditioning regimen [total body irradiation (TBI) vs non-TBI], the only significant factor predicting for superior EFS and OS was up-front vs salvage transplant (4-year EFS 76% vs 38%, p=0.02; 4-year OS 92% vs 73%, p=0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, when calculated from diagnosis, EFS and OS of the up-front and salvage groups were virtually identical, implying that the longer survival post SCT in the up-front group was completely compensated by the longer interval between diagnosis and transplant in the salvage group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median OS from diagnosis was 13.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Except for one case of anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> have not occurred to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data indicate that SCT might improve the prognosis of patients with disseminated FL, although it is probably not curative even if applied early during the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The optimum timing of SCT remains to be determined by the ongoing randomized multicenter trial of the German Low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Study Group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The impact of radiotherapy on the success of SCT does not seem to be as essential as originally believed </plain></SENT>
