<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied cell suspensions from lymph nodes involved by follicular (nodular) non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to determine the capacity of the malignant B cells to secrete immunoglobulin (Ig) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neoplastic B cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> secreted monoclonal immunoglobulin in culture when appropriate signals were provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In most cases, maximal Ig secretion occurred when autologous T cells were removed by E rosette <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, replaced with allogeneic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T cells, and the cultures were exposed to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autologous T cells exerted a suppressor effect on Ig secretion in 8/8 cases studied, diminishing the response of the malignant B cells to allogeneic T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This suppressor effect did not correlate with the percentage of cells staining with anti-Leu-2a or with "helper-suppressor" (Leu-3a-Leu-2a) ratios of the lymph node T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate that the arrested differentiation of most follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is reversible and implicate a T cell-mediated host immunoregulatory mechanism affecting Ig secretion in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An additional contribution of our results is the demonstration of a cell culture system for synthesis of sufficient monoclonal Ig for use as an immunogen in production of anti-idiotype antibodies </plain></SENT>
