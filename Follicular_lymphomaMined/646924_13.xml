<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To substantiate the origin of follicular (nodular) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells from germinal-centre cells, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells from 7 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and from 9 tonsils and 2 lymph nodes were studied for the presence and distribution of complement-receptor subtypes (i.e., the receptors for C3b and C3d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found that erythrocytes coated with antibodies and C3d (EAC3d) adhered exclusively to germinal centres, whereas erythrocytes coated with antibodies and C3b (EAC3b) adhered to germinal centres and in many instances to the regions between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that germinal-centre cells bear both complement-receptor subtypes and that the B cells of the interfollicular area, which belong at least in part to the precursors of plasma cells, bear only a receptor for C3b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In frozen sections of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, a similar distribution of complement-receptor subtypes was observed; EAC3d was bound exclusively to the neoplastic nodules, and EAC3b adhered to the neoplastic nodules and adjacent paranodular tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Receptor studies on suspended cells of both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tonsils and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> revealed a slight predominance of EAC3d(+) cells or equal numbers of EAC3b(+) and EAC3d(+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The complete congruence in the expression and distribution of complement-receptor subtypes between tissues from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and those from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and hyperplastic tonsils or lymph nodes suggests that follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> represents the neoplastic counterpart of the reactive germinal centre </plain></SENT>
