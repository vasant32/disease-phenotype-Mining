<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report updated time-to-event variables of a phase III randomized study comparing <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">yttrium</z:chebi> 90-labeled ibritumomab with rituximab standard therapy in 143 rituximab-naive patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade, follicular, or transformed CD20+ non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most patients (79%) had follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to receive a single intravenous (I.V.) dose of 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan 0.4 mCi/kg (n = 73) or rituximab 375 mg/m2 I.V. weekly for 4 doses (n = 70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The radioimmunotherapy group was pretreated with 2 rituximab doses (250 mg/m2) to improve biodistribution and one dose of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">Indium</z:chebi> 111-labeled ibritumomab tiuxetan for imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 80% versus 56% (P = 0.002) and complete response (CR)/CR unconfirmed (CRu) rates were 34% for 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan versus 20% for rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 44 months, the data are mature as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ongoing patients in both groups exceeded the median Kaplan-Meier estimated time to progression (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>), duration of response (DR), and time to next therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although this study was not powered to detect differences in time-to-event variables, the results from this randomized trial demonstrate trends toward longer median <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> (15 vs. 10.2 months; P = 0.07), DR (16.7 vs. 11.2 months; P = 0.44) and time to next therapy (21.1 vs. 13.8 months; P = 0.27) in follicular NHL patients treated with 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan compared with the rituximab control arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients achieving a CR/CRu, the median <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> was 24.7 months for patients treated with 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan compared with 13.2 months for rituximab-treated patients (P = 0.41), and ongoing responses of &gt; 5 years have been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan produces high response rates and durable remissions in patients with previously treated low-grade, follicular, and transformed NHL </plain></SENT>
