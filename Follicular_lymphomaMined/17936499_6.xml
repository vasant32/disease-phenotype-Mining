<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>) evidences a distinctive clinical presentation and a natural course; thus, in this study, we attempted to devise an adequate prognostic index for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two-hundred and five patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After analysis of the prognostic factors, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS), we constructed a prognostic index of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> (MZLPI) via the summation of each factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then compared PFS and OS with IPI, FLIPI, and MZLPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to our multivariate analysis, nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>, ECOG performance &gt; or = 2, and advanced stage were composed of MZLPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MZLPI was grouped as follows: score 0 as a low-risk group, score 1 as an intermediate risk group, and score 2 as a high-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The PFS curve, according to MZLPI results, evidenced a more discriminated pattern than IPI and FLIPI, and this was especially true in the intermediate risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In OS, MZLPI (P=0.0007) evidenced a more discriminated pattern than IPI (P=NS) or FLIPI (P=0.0044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MZLPI, which is constructed of relatively simple factors, may represent a useful prognostic index for the prediction of PFS and OS in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>, and may also be used as a substitute for IPI or FLIPI </plain></SENT>
