<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the major mutation cluster region (<z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>) have been reported, including two substitutions (397G/C, 502G/A) and one deletion (520DeltaT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical and biological relevance of these SNPs are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on a case-control study, BCL6 SNPs frequencies were assessed in 97 t(14;18) follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) and in 54 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with 3q27 rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Allele frequencies were similar in the FL and controls groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 397 G/C genotype was correlated to a higher-grade transformation risk (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SM were observed in 39.1% of FL and were characterized by a clustering distribution (hot spots spanning position 420-435, 106-127, and 590-600) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No correlation between genotypes or acquired mutational status and BCL6 expression was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, gel mobility-shift assays, using SNPs containing probes show results representative for protein/DNA complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that the first BCL6 intron is a highly variable region as a consequence of both SNP and SM, which may contribute to biology and outcome of FL </plain></SENT>
