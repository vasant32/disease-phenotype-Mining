<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the fate of apoptotic cells in the germinal centers (GCs) of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Lymph node biopsy specimens obtained from 7 SLE patients with benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo>, 5 non-SLE patients with benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> (non-SLE), 5 patients with malignant follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 3 patients with dermatopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002840'>lymphadenitis</z:hpo> were stained with monoclonal antibodies against macrophages (CD68) and follicular dendritic cells (CR2/CD21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TUNEL staining and transmission electron microscopy were performed to detect apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Confocal microscopy was used to evaluate the in vivo capacity of tingible body macrophages to remove apoptotic cell material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In a subgroup of patients with SLE, apoptotic cells accumulated in the GCs of the lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of tingible body macrophages, which usually contained engulfed apoptotic nuclei, was significantly reduced in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to what was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> controls, TUNEL-positive apoptotic material from SLE patients was observed to be directly associated with the surfaces of follicular dendritic cells (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that in a sub-group of SLE patients, apoptotic cells are not properly cleared by tingible body macrophages of the GCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consequently, nuclear autoantigens bind to <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> and may thus provide survival signals for autoreactive B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This action may override an important control mechanism for B cell development, resulting in the loss of tolerance for nuclear antigens </plain></SENT>
