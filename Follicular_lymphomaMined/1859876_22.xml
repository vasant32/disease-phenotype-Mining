<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent work in CLL indicates that CD5+ B lymphocytes are frequently committed to production of autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have examined the antibody specificity of MIgs derived from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells of 31 different patients with CD5- B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells from 8 of these 31 patients (25.8%) express Igs with autoantibody activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two cases antibody activity was multispecific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In four cases, antibody activity was exclusively directed against the Fc fragment of IgG, whereas the two other cases bound to both Fc fragment of IgG and nuclear antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) are derived from CD5- B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that like CLL, NHL also express Igs that frequently have autoantibody activity </plain></SENT>
