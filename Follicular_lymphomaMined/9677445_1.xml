<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: During the period 1986-1995, 169 consecutively registered patients with LG-NHL were retrospectively analyzed with regard to personal, treatment, and disease- specific characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up time was 52 months (5-132 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were diagnosed histologically according to the Keil classification system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median age was 60 years (range 27-87 years), and the male:female ratio was 1.05: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response rate was 77%, of which 66% were complete response (CR) and 11% partial response (PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>5- and 10-year overall survival were 72% and 47%, respectively, and median overall survival was 8.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>10-year overall survival for stage I, II, III, and IV were 86%, 65%, 33%, and 29%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 10-year survival was 52% and median survival 12.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, the following pre-treatment factors indicated a poor prognosis: advanced stage, general symptoms, bone marrow infiltration, poor performance status, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> &gt; or = 6 cm, low serum albumin, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, and LDH &gt; or = 540 U/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, stage, performance status, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> were found to be independent prognostic factors for overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The treatment strategy has proved successful for most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localised disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Independent prognostic indicators for survival as stage, performance status, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> may be useful guides in deciding when and how to treat </plain></SENT>
