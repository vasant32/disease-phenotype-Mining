<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory FcgammaRIIb (CD32b) has an opposing effect on effector cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined whether an FcgammaRIIb 232 isoleucine (I)/threonine (T) polymorphism predicts rituximab response in 101 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty-four patients were 232 I/I, 15 were 232 I/T and two were 232 T/T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The response rate was similar among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 2-year progression free survival (PFS) and median time to progression (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) were not different between I/I and I/T groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> was not determined in T/T group because of small number of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The FcgammaRIIIa 158 V/V and FcgammaRIIa 131 H/H genotypes continued to emerge as independent predictors for higher response rate and longer <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study is the first to determine whether inhibitory FcgammaRIIb play a role in rituximab's anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> effect in humans </plain></SENT>
