<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fifteen cases of cutaneous follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were evaluated clinically, histologically, and immunologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine of the patients presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin disease</z:e> alone, which showed a predilection for the scalp and forehead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The six remaining cases had either concurrent or secondary cutaneous involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the cases had a nodular configuration which was evident histologically or immunologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In many cases, the diagnostic microscopic fields were in the deep dermis or subcutis, with nonspecific <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the superficial dermis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cases consisted of five small cleaved, seven mixed, and three large cell follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A senior dermatopathologist diagnosed four of the 15 cases as benign, indicating the difficulty of diagnosis by <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> alone when the biopsy is small or the inflammatory component is prominent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This underscores the importance of large, deep biopsies for accurate histologic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunological studies confirmed the B cell lineage of these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An unexpectedly high proportion of immunoglobulin-negative cases (eight cases) was found, especially among the primary cutaneous follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (six of nine cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin-expressing cases exhibited monotypic immunoglobulin light-chain staining of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the dendritic reticulum cell network within <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> follicles lacked the polytypic immunoglobulin complexes characteristic of reactive follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As described previously for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in lymph nodes, many cases exhibited polytypic follicular mantle zones similar to reactive follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The low-grade nature of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was supported by clinical follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We conclude that given adequate sampling, cutaneous follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> can usually be diagnosed by histologic criteria similar to those used for lymph nodes; however, immunohistologic studies are an important adjunct </plain></SENT>
