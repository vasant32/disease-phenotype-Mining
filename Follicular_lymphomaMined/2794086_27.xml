<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (10 men, one woman) corresponded histologically to intermediate (INT) or mantle zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and five, with less well defined features, were designated small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with cleaved cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The blood films showed a pleomorphic picture with lymphoid cells of predominantly medium size with nuclear irregularities and clefts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The membrane phenotype of the circulating cells showed strong immunoglobulin staining and reactivity with CD5 and FMC7 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases tested; CD10 was positive in six out of nine cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The membrane phenotype of two of the five cases of small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was close to those of B-CLL and three resembled INT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow trephine biopsy specimens showed a diffuse pattern of infiltration in INT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median survival of these patients was less than two years, suggesting that a leukaemic presentation is associated with poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By combining data from histology, membrane markers, and peripheral blood <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, the leukaemic phase of typical INT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> can be defined in most cases </plain></SENT>
