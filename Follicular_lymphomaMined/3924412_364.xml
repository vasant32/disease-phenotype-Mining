<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have characterized the t(14;18)(q32;q21) chromosomal translocation present in over 60% of human follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We exploited an unexpected rearrangement of an Ig heavy-chain gene to clone the chromosomal breakpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An element isolated from 18q21 mediated translocations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four t(14;18) bearing cell lines and in six of 11 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, but did not normally rearrange in other B or non-B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The breakpoints clustered within a small 4.3 kb region on chromosome 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The breakpoints on chromosome 14 were focused within or immediately 5' to JH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These breakpoints retained the Ig enhancer region close to a new transcriptional unit identified on chromosome segment 18q21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since none of the cellular oncogenes are known to map to 18q21, cloning this element provides an opportunity to characterize a potentially new transforming gene </plain></SENT>
