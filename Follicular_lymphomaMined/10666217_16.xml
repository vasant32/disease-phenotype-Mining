<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rearrangements due to chromosomal translocations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> of the 5' noncoding regulatory region of the BCL-6 gene are potential mechanisms for altering its expression in NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further elucidate the nature of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in the regulatory region of this gene, we have studied 10 healthy donors and 11 NHL biopsy samples by extensive molecular cloning and sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we analyzed the BCL-6 genes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and nontumor cells from 2 of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The germ line sequence of this region was defined, which differs in 7 positions from that previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, 1 polymorphic variation at position 397(G or C) was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deletions, insertions, and repeated substitution mutations were detected among the molecular isolates in 8 tumor specimens, with a mutational incidence ranging from 1.3 x 10(-3) to 1.3 x 10(-2)/bp (base pair) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 20 distinct substitution mutations, 1 insertion and 3 deletions were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One of these deletion mutations and 2 of the substitutions were observed in more than 1 tumor specimen from different individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 3 tumor samples, identical mutations affecting both alleles were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest the presence of mutational hot spots and hot specific events, a finding supported by our compilation of previously published data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 6 samples, the nucleotide sequences showed evidence of intraclonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, consistent with a stepwise ongoing mutational process affecting the BCL-6 gene in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These mutations accumulating in the regulatory region of the BCL-6 gene could play a role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> progression and in the transformation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> to more aggressive large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
