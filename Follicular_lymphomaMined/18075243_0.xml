<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is one of the most common non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of B cells, being closely associated with a t(14;18) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detection of t(14;18), which is present in 70-95% of FL, might aid in FL diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of routine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques in detecting t(14;18) in paraffin-embedded tissue samples of FL patients at different stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combined with other immunophenotypic biological determinants, detection of t(14;18) might help to determine patients at increased risk according to the FL International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) and therefore facilitate appropriate treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Design and Methods: This study was mainly based on a retrospective examination of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We selected fixed tissue samples of 21 FL patients treated at the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute Center in the period from 2000 to 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FISH techniques could detect 14 of 18 FL cases with a sensitivity of 77.8%, while the PCR technique could detect only 11 of 18 FL cases with a sensitivity of 61.1%, resulting in a statistically significant difference between both techniques (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to the FLIPI index, 9 of the 18 FL patients were categorized into the high-risk group (50%), 5 in the intermediated-risk group (27.8%) and 4 in the low-risk group (22.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The sensitivity of FISH is superior to that of PCR in the detection of the t(14;18) translocation in paraffin-embedded tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There is a statistically significant correlation between both CD10 and FISH with FLIPI </plain></SENT>
