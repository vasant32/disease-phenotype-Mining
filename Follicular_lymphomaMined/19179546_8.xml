<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Relapse cases were identified from 241 consecutive patients autografted for disseminated untransformed FL from 1990 to 2002 in three institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prognostic factors for relapse and outcome after relapse were analyzed by log-rank comparisons and Cox regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and three relapses occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 10-year relapse probability was 47% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median time from autoSCT to relapse was 20 (2-128) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only three relapses were observed later than 6 years posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median survival after relapse was 8.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with disease recurrence within 1 year from transplant and those who had received autoSCT as second-line treatment had significantly reduced survival by multivariate analysis, whereas Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index score, age, remission status at autoSCT, high-dose regimen, and ex vivo purging had no impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FL recurrence after autoSCT follows a biphasic pattern with continuing relapse during the first 6 years and only few events thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prognosis after relapse is relatively good and appears to be comparable to that of disease recurrence after standard treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The situation is less favorable for patients who relapse within the first posttransplant year </plain></SENT>
