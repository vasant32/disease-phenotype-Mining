<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Results from four randomized controlled trials comparing the addition of rituximab to chemotherapy regimens: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (CVP); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (CHOP); or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>, and interferon alpha (CHVP + IFNalpha) versus chemotherapy alone were used to develop a Markov model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rates of disease progression and the duration of treatment effect were obtained from the trial data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatments were compared in two ways: 1) an individual comparison of rituximab + chemotherapy versus chemotherapy and 2) a multiple treatment comparison using league tables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Economic and clinical outcomes (quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)) were estimated over patient lifetimes and discounted at 3.5% per annum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the individual comparison, the addition of rituximab increased QALYs by (mean, 95% confidence interval) 1.174 (1.02-1.30), 0.909 (0.79-1.01), 0.823 (0.71-0.91), and 0.453 (0.40-0.50) for <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>, CVP, CHOP, and CHVP, respectively, compared with chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incremental costs per QALY gained were pound7474, pound8621, pound10,732, and pound8551, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses indicated that rituximab plus chemotherapy was a cost-effective treatment option, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below a threshold of pound30,000 per QALY gained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When compared across the chemotherapy regimens, rituximab plus <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> appeared to be the single most cost-effective treatment option, but further randomized trials are required to substantiate this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The addition of rituximab to chemotherapy in advanced FL was found to be highly cost-effective in the UK </plain></SENT>
