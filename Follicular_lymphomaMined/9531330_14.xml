<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven cases of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> out of 300 cases of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> totally lacked expression of class I molecules as determined by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical data confirmed a particular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> of these cases with frequent extra-nodal involvement, a poor international prognostic index, a histological high grade and a poor outcome leading to early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in five of the seven cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A previous diagnosis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> characterized by bcl-2 rearrangements was made in four of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HLA-G (class Ib gene), which is reported to bind killer inhibitory receptors on NK cells, was absent from the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, it was detected in three out of four cases at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level with transcripts encoding soluble forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional analysis revealed other abnormalities: class II was negative in four out of the seven NHL cases and decreased expression of beta2 microglobulin was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">Peptide</z:chebi> transporter proteins (TAP1) were detected in various degrees by immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations showed that total lack of class I or class II molecules is a rare event in NHL and is associated with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This could support a role for specific autologous T cells in immune surveillance </plain></SENT>
