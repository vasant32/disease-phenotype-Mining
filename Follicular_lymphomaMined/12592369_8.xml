<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The few studies published on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> have raised the question of whether or not microvessel density (MVD) is associated with more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> and have reported the observation that in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, vessels are mature rather than immature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated MVD and the vascular phenotype within follicular or diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, reactive nodes and tonsils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vascular phenotype was defined by the expression or loss of reactivity to the antibody LH39 (detecting the LH39 laminin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> of the basement membrane in mature vessels) and by detection of alpha V beta 3 (expressed on immature vessels) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In reactive nodes and in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, MVD was higher in the paracortex than in germinal centres or in neoplastic follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in neoplastic follicles an increase in alpha V beta 3-positive endothelium suggested the activation of an angiogenic pathway different from that present in the reactive follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, MVD was higher than in reactive and neoplastic follicles but lower than in the reactive paracortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of immature vessels (LH39 negative) and of alpha V beta 3-positive vessels was higher than in reactive lymph nodes and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> suggesting that a switch to a different angiogenic pathway has occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, we have demonstrated that within reactive and neoplastic follicles vascular regression is occurring, perhaps constraining the growth of reactive follicles alongside other phenomena such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vascular regression was previously believed to occur in adults only in ovarian and endometrial tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that different types of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> are present in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This has implications for possible future therapies </plain></SENT>
