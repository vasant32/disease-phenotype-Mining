<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to IPI, 24 patients (42%) were in the low-risk, 28 (49%) in the intermediate-risk, and 4 (7%) in the high-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The distribution according to FLIPI was: 20 (35%) in the low-risk, 8 (14%) in the intermediate-risk, and 29 (51%) in the high-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to IPI score, median OS was not reached for the low-risk, it was 45 months for the intermediate-risk and 25 months for the high-risk group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When FLIPI score was applied, median OS was not reached for the low and intermediate-risk, and was 42 months for the high-risk group (p = 0.0064) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that: (1) FLIPI score could be validated in a Brazilian population; (2) FLIPI is more accurate than IPI to identify FL patients having worse prognosis (51%); (3) IPI seems to be a better tool for clinical decisions because it selected a smaller high-risk group (7%) having worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our opinion, IPI high-risk patients are the real candidates for more aggressive therapies, avoiding unnecessary over-treatment </plain></SENT>
