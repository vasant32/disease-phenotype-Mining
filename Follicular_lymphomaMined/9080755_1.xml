<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To study the characteristics of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in aboriginal and nonaboriginal patients in eastern Taiwan, the records of 90 patients treated from July 1986 to September 1994 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunohistologic staining with UCHL-1 and L-26 was used to determine immunophenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 20 aboriginal and 70 nonaboriginal patients (22% vs 78%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among them, three had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's diseases</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) and 87 had non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparing the histology of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in aboriginal and nonaboriginal patients, there was no case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in aborigines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concerning primary extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, no aboriginal patients were found to have gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, while eight nonaboriginal patients did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients with intermediate and high-grade NHL, aboriginal patients had a higher rate of B symptoms (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, night sweats) than did nonaboriginal patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, three out of four (75%) aboriginal patients had angioimmunoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dysproteinemia</z:e> as compared with three out of 20 (15%) nonaboriginal patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in demographic data, stage or distribution of immunophenotype between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Several combination chemotherapy regimens were used and only 31 patients were considered evaluable, of which 12 were aboriginal and 19 were nonaboriginal patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No distinct difference was found between aboriginal and nonaboriginal patients in overall response rate, complete response rate, disease-free survival or overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Comparison of our results with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> studies in Taiwan revealed that the frequencies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were higher in northern Taiwan studies than in southern and eastern Taiwan studies, and the frequency of primary extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was much higher in eastern Taiwan than in other areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>While the rate of T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in NHL for nonaboriginal patients was similar to that of northern Taiwan studies, it was closer to that of southern Taiwan studies in aboriginal patients </plain></SENT>
