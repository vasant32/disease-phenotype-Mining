<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) with numerous large cells resembling the lacunar and Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells of classic Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were studied to determine clonal relationships between the HRS-like cells and centrocytic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> (CCCB) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both cases, CCCB cells were typical of FL; CD45RB, CD20, CD10 and BCL-2 positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In case 1, the HRS-like cells were positive for CD45RB, CD20, CD10, CD30, OCT2, and BOB.1 and negative for CD15 and bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In case 2, the HRS-like cells were positive for CD30, fascin, CD20, OCT2, and BOB.1 and negative for CD45RB, CD10, CD15, and bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CCCB and single HRS-like cells were isolated by laser capture microdissection followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both cases, identical sequences were obtained from CCCB and HRS-like cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings confirm that although the HRS cells and CCCB cells in these cases demonstrate morphologic and immunophenotypic divergence, they share a common cell of origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These cases further highlight the potential diagnostic pitfall presented by FL with HRS-like cells </plain></SENT>
