<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Herein we reported a case of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with 50.26% clonal malignant lymphocytes and 50% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells positive for the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene and B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 2 gene (IGH-BCL2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether endothelial cells (ECs) within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> share the feature of advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, we isolated and purified the ECs from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> by using the immunomagnetic beads conjugated with a monoclonal antibody against CD34, a surface marker of ECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, we identified ECs according to their <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and found that ECs presented consistently flat and elongated appearance with a lot of Weibel-Palade bodies in the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results of flow cytometry confirmed that ECs isolated from the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> expressed high level of both vWF and CD34 and the purity of the ECs fraction was more than 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we used FISH to check chromosomal aberration in the purified ECs and found that some of the ECs had only one fusion signal for the green IGH probe and the red BCL2 probe in contrast to typical t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation with two fusion signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon was also observed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It might be a different breakpoint of IGH in this case, which induced the loss of the fusion signal, indicating t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The positive cells accounted for 18% of the isolated ECs from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, indicating that a proportion of ECs from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had the same chromosome aberration as the neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
