<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nineteen cases showed evidence of either a t(14;18) or a rearrangement of one of three genomic probes for breakpoints at 18q21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical and histologic evidence of transformation from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> was available in six cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Except for age, prognostic clinical variables (LDH, stage, extranodal involvement) were similar between the 18q21 rearranged patients and DLCL patients without 18q21 rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up in excess of 2 years for both groups, there was no difference in overall survival between the 18q21 rearranged group compared to DLCL patients lacking this genetic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median disease-free survival for the 18q21 rearranged group, however, was significantly shorter and survival in partial remission longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The propensity for extended survival of the 18q21 rearranged DLCL patients with residual or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> resembled the clinical behaviour of nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients with t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that cytogenic or molecular genetic identification of a chromosome 18q21 translocation may be of prognostic significance in the analysis of treatment protocols for patients with DLCL </plain></SENT>
