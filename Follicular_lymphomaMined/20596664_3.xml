<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that some microRNAs have oncogenic or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) is an aggressive non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> biology, which has impeded the clinical assessment of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The currently-used clinically-based IPI provides useful information for treatment decision making, but has limited predictive power </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent immunohistochemical approaches have identified two different prognostic groups: the more indolent germinal centre (GC)- and the higher risk activated B-cell (ABC)-like phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although useful, prediction based on immunophenotype has limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present study uses microRNA profiling and a number of well-characterised B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines to identify microRNA signatures that are correctly assigned to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> prognostic subgroups and distinguish <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> from other more indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, including follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MicroRNA microarray analysis was based on miRBase version 12.0 and analysis was performed using an unsupervised hierarchical clustering model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Discriminatory microRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We identified a 9 microRNA signature that discriminated between ABC- and GC-like <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This included 3 newly identified microRNAs, not previously associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and predicted to target genes that are de-regulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> was distinguished from FL by 4 microRNAs and a total of 18 microRNAs were identified that differentiated between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and control populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most of the discriminatory microRNAs have been reported previously to be known oncomiRs or act as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present study identified a microRNA signature that correctly classified GC and ABC phenotypes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This signature has yet to be assessed for prediction in clinical samples </plain></SENT>
