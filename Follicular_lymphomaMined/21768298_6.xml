<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in situ (FLIS) was first described nearly a decade ago, but its clinical significance remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reevaluated our original series and more recently diagnosed cases to develop criteria for the distinction of FLIS from partial involvement by follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (PFL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 34 cases of FLIS were identified, most often as an incidental finding in a reactive lymph node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six of 34 patients had prior or concurrent FL, and 5 of 34 had FLIS composite with another <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of patients with negative staging at diagnosis and available follow-up (21 patients), only one (5%) developed FL (follow-up: median, 41 months; range, 10-118 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was not available in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization for BCL2 gene rearrangement was positive in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 17 cases tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PFL patients were more likely to develop FL, diagnosed in 9 of 17 (53%) who were untreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients with PFL were treated with local radiation therapy (4) or rituximab (2) and remained with no evidence of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FLIS can be reliably distinguished from PFL and has a very low rate of progression to clinically significant FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FLIS may represent the tissue counterpart of circulating t(14;18)-positive B cells </plain></SENT>
