<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other studies have suggested an inverse relationship between p53 and bcl-2 protein expression in breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancers</z:e> and in a variety of subtypes of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the relationship between bcl-2 and p53 protein expression and the correlation between these findings and the grade and cell type of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> according to the REAL classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Paraffin-embedded nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (n = 37) were subjected to bcl-2 and p53 immunohistochemistry on tissue sections using a three-step ABC system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Positive immunostaining for both oncoproteins was scored using a three-tiered scale: +, &lt; 10 per cent cells; ++, 10-50 per cent cells; and ++(+), &gt; 50 per cent cells (&lt; 10 per cent was used as a cut-off to define negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ninety-seven per cent (36/37) of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> expressed bcl-2 protein in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three grades, manifesting in the small cell (grade 1) through to the large cell (grade 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>p53 protein expression showed a pattern of increasing immunostaining with progression towards the high-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>: grade 1 = 6 per cent (1/16); grade 2 = 48 per cent (10/21); grade 3 = 100 per cent (6/6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five cases comprised varying combinations of grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This latter finding suggests a role for p53 mutation in the progression/transformation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mechanism, however, differs from that suggested in breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic cancers</z:e>, since an inverse relationship between bcl-2 and p53 was not demonstrated in the present study </plain></SENT>
