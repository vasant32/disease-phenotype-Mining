<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study on 105 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was undertaken to determine the clinical significance of mitotic activity in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each case, two pathologists independently counted mitotic figures in 20 random high-power fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The difference of the average mitotic counts over 20 high-power fields for the two pathologists showed a Gaussian distribution with a median difference of -0.26 counts per high-power field and a standard error of 0.10 per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 94 cases (91 per cent), the difference was less than two mitotic counts per high-power field, indicating good interobserver agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant difference in mitotic counts between subtypes of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> as well as a gradient among subtypes, with the lowest mitotic activity in the poorly differentiated lymphocytic subtype and highest in the undifferentiated subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A multivariate statistical analysis of clinical and pathologic variables showed that mitotic figures were not of prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
