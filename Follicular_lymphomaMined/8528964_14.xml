<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The t(14,18) chromosomal translocation, which results in a fusion <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> containing the entire coding region of BCL-2 and a portion of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene, is commonly found in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and appears to play a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> by inhibiting cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that downregulation of BCL-2 would decrease accumulation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells by treating the t(14,18)-carrying follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line WSU-FSCCL in vitro with antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) directed against BCL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found dose-dependent, sequence-specific inhibition of cell accumulation by an antisense unmodified ODN directed at codons 2 to 7, which downregulated BCL-2 protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This effect was near maximal at an ODN concentration of 40 micrograms/mL (6.9 mumol/L), with minimal toxicity by control sense, reverse, and mutated antisense ODN at the same concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pre-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line REH showed no sequence-specific growth inhibition by the antisense ODN at these concentrations, and BCL-2 protein levels were not altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that WSU-FSCCL may be useful in a murine model to optimize antisense ODN for potential therapeutic utility </plain></SENT>
