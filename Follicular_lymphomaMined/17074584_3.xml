<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The TRF data were correlated with BCL2 gene rearrangement evaluated by nested and long-distance polymerase chain reaction approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood cells from 12 healthy donors were studied as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both groups of NHL patients revealed significant telomere shortening compared with controls (8.50 +/- 0.50 kb; P &lt; 0.001), with significantly shorter TRFs in S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (3.49 +/- 0.26 kb) than in FL cases (4.09 +/- 0.12 kb; P = 0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients carrying BCL2 gene rearrangements showed longer telomere length (4.19 +/- 0.14 kb) than those without (3.51 +/- 0.14 kb; P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among patients with FL, telomere length was shortest in patients without t(14;18), intermediate when breakpoints occurred in the minor breakpoint cluster region (3.97 +/- 0.33 kb), and greater when breakpoints occurred in the major breakpoint region (MBR) (4.24 +/- 0.15 kb), with significant differences between MBR and BCL2-negative cases (P = 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the existence of alternative genetic pathways involved in the origin of these FL subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Even though the number of S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> cases was small, they showed the shortest telomere length, suggesting that this parameter reflects another genetic alteration involved in the progression from FL to a higher-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
