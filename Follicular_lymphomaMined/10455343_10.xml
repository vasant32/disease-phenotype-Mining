<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six consecutive patients (10 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, seven mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, seven B-CLL, two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytomas</z:e>) were mobilized using chemotherapy plus G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sufficient numbers of PBPC could be collected from 24 patients and were immunoselected with the semiautomated Isolex 300 (n = 17) or the fully integrated Isolex 300i (n = 7) devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The selection products were assayed by PCR amplification of clonal CDRIII or t(14;18) rearrangements for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumor</z:e> cell content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Residual disease</z:e> and long-term hematopoietic and immune recovery were studied by assessing the following parameters at 3, 6, and 12 months post-transplant: CDRIII or t(14;18) PCR, platelet count, lymphocyte subsets, serum IgG, serum IgA, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025007" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measles</z:e> titer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the Isolex 300 device 26% (10-65) of input CD34+ cells were recovered with a median purity of 89.2% (49.4-98.9) after CD34+ selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Isolex 300i device allowed significantly better recoveries (46% (22-86)) and purities of CD34+ cells (98.8% (92.2-99.2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall purging efficacy was 3.2 (0.6-5.1) log </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients have been reinfused with CD34+ selected grafts after myeloablative preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rapid engraftment occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 28 (19-42) months, 14 patients are alive without clinical or molecular evidence of disease recurrence, whereas five have relapsed and one additional patient shows persistent presence of the disease-specific molecular marker without clinical progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cellular and serological parameters of hematopoietic and immune functions were largely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at 12 months post-transplant including the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025007" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measles</z:e> titer which was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Kinetics of immunohematopoietic recovery were similar to those of 12 control patients who had received unmanipulated PBPC during the same time period except for the recovery of CD4+ CD45RA+ T cells which was significantly delayed in the CD34+ group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During the first year post-transplant, transient monoclonal or oligoclonal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178650" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gammopathies</z:e> were observed in seven of 16 study patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We conclude that CD34+ selection with the Isolex system allows preparation of highly purified CD34+ fractions and effective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The CD34+ products can be reinfused safely after myeloablative treatment and result in sustained hematopoietic and immune recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The fact that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients retained their specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025007" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measles</z:e> immunity suggests that myeloablative treatment with reinfusion of highly purified CD34+ PBPC is not immunoablative </plain></SENT>
