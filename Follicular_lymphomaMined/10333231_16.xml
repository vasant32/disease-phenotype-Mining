<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MLP is thought to represent mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) of the GI tract; however, some cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) of the GI tract are found with a multiple polypoid appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, to clarify the cellular origin of MLP, clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement of four cases with MLP was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and analyzed for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The IgH variable (VH) region sequences of three cases (CD5+ CD10- cyclin D1+) showed a little <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> compared with the closest published germline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other case (CD10+ CD5- cyclin D1-) was highly mutated and showed intraclonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> (ongoing somatic hypermutation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that three of the cases with MLP are derived from pregerminal center B cells (mantle zone B cells) and one case with MLP from germinal center B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that MLP is a heterogenous group that includes <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> and FL </plain></SENT>
