<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) generally expresses immunoglobulin (Ig) with somatically mutated variable (V) region genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, these almost always carry introduced motifs available for N-glycosylation (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Introduced motifs are uncommon on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells, but are on other germinal center (GC)-associated B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> suggesting a site-specific role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They are not evident in mutated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) or <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently, we found that the glycosylation sites are unusual in containing oligomannose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi>, which are apparently displayed on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell surface IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This suggests a potential interaction with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> receptor in the GC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, natural N-glycosylation sites exist in germline (GL) V region genes, particularly the V4-34 gene expressed by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells and by some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, including CLL, potentially undermining the selective importance for FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To compare <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharide</z:chebi> addition at the introduced and natural sites, we expressed V region genes as single chain Fv (scFv) and analyzed the added <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to introduced sites, which were oligomannosylated, the natural GL motif in the V4-34 sequence had no added <z:chebi fb="96" ids="16646">sugars</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The remarkable selective glycosylation within the heavy chain V region gene of FL apparently permits only limited processing to oligomannose at somatically mutated motifs, creating a feature exploitable by GC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
