<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: A recent report suggested improvements in survival after follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), but not for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> racial/ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To better understand the reasons for these FL survival differences, we examined the joint influences of diagnostic period, race/ethnicity, and neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) on survival in a large population-based case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients (n = 15,937) diagnosed with FL between 1988 and 2005 in California were observed for vital status through November 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall and FL-specific survival were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neighborhood SES was assigned from United States Census data using residence at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall and FL-specific survival improved 22% and 37%, respectively, from 1988 to 1997 to 1998 to 2005, and were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> racial/ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Asian/Pacific Islanders had better survival than non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, and black patients who had similar outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lower neighborhood SES was associated with worse survival in patients across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages of disease (P for trend &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with the lowest SES quintile had a 49% increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.49, 95% CI, 1.30 to 1.72) and 31% increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from FL (HR = 1.31; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.60) than patients with the highest SES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Evolving therapies have likely led to improvements in survival after FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although improvements have occurred within <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> racial/ethnic groups, lower neighborhood SES was significantly associated with substantially poorer survival </plain></SENT>
