<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some advocate no treatment until symptoms arise, while others prefer to treat with intensive combination regimens and others with single agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the long-term effects of two types of combination chemotherapy on relapse-free survival and survival on 91 patients (88 were stages III-IV) who had received no previous chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those patients with FSCC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> obtaining a complete remission had a significantly longer median survival than did those obtaining a partial remission (13 years versus 2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An adriamycin-containing regimen appeared to be the key factor in obtaining a complete remission in FSCC after taking into consideration prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Not only was the complete response rate significantly higher for patients receiving adriamycin, but so too was the median survival and relapse-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BCG immunotherapy appeared to be important in preventing relapse in some of the complete responders with NPDL who received adriamycin </plain></SENT>
