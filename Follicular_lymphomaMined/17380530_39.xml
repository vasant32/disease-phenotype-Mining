<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Radioimmunotherapy with radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies to CD20 produces a high response rate in patients with recurring non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), but the durability of those remissions is not well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data on patients with recurring NHL treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">yttrium</z:chebi> Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan in 4 clinical trials were reviewed to identify patients with a long-term response, defined as a time to progression of 12 months or longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Long-term responses were seen in 37% (78/211) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 53.5 months (range, 12.7-88.9) the median duration of response was 28.1 months and the median time to progression was 29.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A third of these patients had been treated with at least 3 previous therapies, and 37% of them had not responded to their last therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The findings in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=59) were similar to those in the overall population of long-term responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The estimated overall survival at 5 years was 53% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients treated with 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan and 81% for long-term responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan can produce durable responses and prolonged overall survival in a substantial number of patients in whom previous therapies have failed </plain></SENT>
