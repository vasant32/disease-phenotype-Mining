<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the impact of programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> 1 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-1) -positive inhibitory immunoregulatory lymphoid cells in the clinicobiologic features and outcome of patients with FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined samples from 100 patients (53 men and 47 women; median age, 54 years) at diagnosis, as well as in 32 patients at first relapse, with a recently generated monoclonal antibody against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cells were quantified using computerized image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional analysis consisted of double immunofluorescence and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-1 expression was alternative to FOXP3 in lymphoid cells from both reactive tonsils and FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, the median percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-1-positive cells was 14% (range, 0.1% to 74%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with grade 3 FL, poor performance status, and high serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase showed lower numbers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-1-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 6.2 years, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-1-positive cells &lt;or= 5% (n = 25), 6% to 33% (n = 50), and more than 33% (n = 25) had a 5-year progression-free survival rate of 20%, 46%, and 48% (P = .038) and overall survival (OS) of 50%, 77%, and 95% (P = .004), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-1 and FL International Prognostic Index maintained prognostic value for OS in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-1-positive cells &lt;or= 5% showed a higher risk of histologic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At that time, transformed diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had lower percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-1-positive cells than FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A high content of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-1-positive cells predicted favorable outcome of FL patients, whereas a marked reduction is observed in transformation </plain></SENT>
