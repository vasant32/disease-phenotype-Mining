<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is characterized by a relatively indolent clinical course, but the disease often transforms into a more aggressive large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we analyzed 41 cases of FL known to have subsequently transformed to aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and an additional 64 FL samples from patients not subsequently transformed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied BCL6 gene rearrangement by the methodology of long-distance inverse polymerase chain reaction (LDI-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 41 cases known to transform, 16 (39.0%) harbored BCL6 translocation or deletion at the time of FL diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 64 cases not known to transform, BCL6 translocation was detected in 9 (14.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of BCL6 translocation in the group known to transform was significantly higher (P =.0048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the transformation cases, the partners of the BCL6 translocation were identified in 13 cases and included IGH, CIITA, U50HG, MBNL, GRHPR, LRMP, EIF4A2, RhoH/<z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi>, and LOC92656 (similar to NAPA), whereas in the control group the BCL6 partners were IGH, CIITA, SIAT1, and MBNL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 13 cases paired specimens before and after transformation were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among these paired specimens, a loss (3 cases) or a gain (1 case) of BCL6 translocation was observed after the transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of clonality showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these cases represented the evolution of a subclone of the original <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrated that BCL6 translocation is not necessary for transformation but that BCL6 translocation in FL may constitute a subgroup with a higher risk to transform into aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
