<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the basis of observations in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) with downstream Ig heavy chain (IGH) class switch recombination (CSR), we hypothesized that downstream CSR-mediated chromosomal translocations would leave the V(D)J-Cmu transcription unit intact, thereby still allowing IgM expression from the IGH allele involved in the translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we analyzed biallelic IGH translocations in the IgM-expressing cell line Z-138 by interphase FISH, DNA fiber-FISH, long-distance vectorette PCR, and DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One IGH allele was involved in a t(11;14), showing a break in the JH region that juxtaposed the Emu enhancer and the 3' Calpha enhancers to the cyclin D1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other IGH allele contained a t(8;14) breakpoint involving the 3' end of a Sgamma region, whereas the reciprocal breakpoint at 8q24 was approximately 40 kb centromeric of MYC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis showed that this IGH allele harbored a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> V(D)J-Cmu complex, which is responsible for IgM expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data show that chromosomal breakpoints such as the t(8;14) can occur in downstream IGH constant regions and do not necessarily interfere with Ig expression </plain></SENT>
