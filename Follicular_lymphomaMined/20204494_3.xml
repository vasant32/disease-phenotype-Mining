<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been estimated that 65,980 individuals were diagnosed with non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and 19,500 died from NHL in the United States in 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although established risk factors such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> may be responsible for a portion of the cases, the majority of NHL cases remain unexplained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dietary nitrate and <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> intake are exposures of particular interest for NHL risk as they are precursors in the endogenous formation of N-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35800">nitroso compounds</z:chebi>, which cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in animal studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated NHL risk overall and by histologic type in relation to dietary nitrate and <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> intake in a population-based case-control study of 1,304 women in Connecticut </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nitrate and <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> intake were assessed using a 120-item food frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found no association between risk of NHL overall and dietary nitrate and a slightly increased risk of NHL with higher dietary <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> intake (highest vs. lowest intake quartile OR = 1.4; 95% CI: 0.9-2.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When we evaluated intake by subtype, a significant positive trend was observed for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and nitrate (p-trend = 0.04) and <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> (p-trend &lt; 0.01) with an over twofold risk in the highest <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> intake quartile (OR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.1-4.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An increased risk in the highest quartile of <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> intake was also observed for T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR = 3.4; 95% CI: 1.0-11.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Animal products containing <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> were more strongly associated with risk of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; whereas, both animal and plant sources of <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> were associated with elevated ORs for T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm a previous finding for <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> intake and NHL risk and highlight the importance of evaluating histologic type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that these results should be replicated in a larger study with data on drinking water as well as dietary sources of nitrate intake </plain></SENT>
