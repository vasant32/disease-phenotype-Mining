<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated 17 cases of follicular large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> using monoclonal antibodies applied to frozen sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The neoplastic cells in 11 cases (65%) showed evidence of immunoglobulin expression similar to the reported percentage of immunoglobulin expressing diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and lower than seen in low grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases showed expression of the B lineage markers T015, B1, and 4G7, and HLA-DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CALLA was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1 case, similar to that reported for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and much higher than reported for diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Approximately one-half of the cases showed weak expression of Tac, 5 cases expressed B2 (C3d), and 3 cases expressed T05 (C3b) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Variable expression was seen for the Ki-67 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A CR4/23+, B2+, T05+ dendritic population was identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An interfollicular host T-cell infiltrate was noted, mainly phenotypic helper cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that follicular large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has immunologic similarities to both diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the low grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
