<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To improve outcomes, the German Low-Grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Study Group (GLSG) initiated a randomized trial to compare the effect of potentially curative myeloablative radiochemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) maintenance therapy in first remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three hundred seven patients (younger than 60 years) with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were recruited into the trial from 130 institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 2 cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHOP) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>) induction chemotherapy, patients were randomly assigned to either the ASCT or the IFN-alpha group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The respective therapy was started when patients achieved complete or partial remission after induction chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two hundred forty patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are evaluable for the comparison of ASCT and IFN-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients who underwent ASCT, the 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 64.7%, and in the IFN-alpha arm it was 33.3% (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As expected, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> toxicity was higher in the ASCT group, but early mortality was below 2.5% in both study arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this randomized, multicenter trial, high-dose radiochemotherapy followed by ASCT significantly improved PFS compared with IFN-alpha in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> when applied as consolidation in first remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Longer follow-up is necessary to determine the effect of ASCT on overall survival </plain></SENT>
