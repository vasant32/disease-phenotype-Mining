<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine what are the signaling pathways that mediate the cross-talk between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-infiltrating inflammatory cells and contribute to the clinical outcome of FL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression profiling and pathway impact analyses were done from pretreatment <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissue of 24 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings were validated immunohistochemically in an independent cohort of 81 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with the combination of rituximab and cyclophoshamide-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, microarray was used to screen the genes differentially expressed between control and rituximab-stimulated B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the transcripts differentially expressed in the FL tissues between the patients with favorable or adverse outcomes, an overrepresentation of genes associated with the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)5a pathway was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a validation set, a better progression-free survival was observed among the patients with high STAT5a protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the FL tissue, STAT5a positivity was barely detectable in the neoplastic B cells, but a subpopulation of follicular dendritic cells and T lymphocytes showed prominent STAT5a expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rituximab was found to induce the expression of STAT5a-associated interleukin-15 in B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in culture, thereby providing a possible explanation for the cross-talk between rituximab-stimulated FL cells and their microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that STAT5a activity in immunologically active nonmalignant cells acts as molecular predictor for rituximab and cyclophoshamide-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>-treated FL patients </plain></SENT>
