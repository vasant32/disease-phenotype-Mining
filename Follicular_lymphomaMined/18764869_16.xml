<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Oblimersen was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion at a daily dose of 3 mg/kg/d for 7 d on alternate weeks for 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rituximab was given at a weekly dose of 375 mg/m(2) for six doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with stable disease or objective response were allowed to receive a second course of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate (ORR) was 42% with 10 complete responses (CR) and eight partial responses (PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve (28%) patients achieved a minimal response or stable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 20 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> the ORR was 60% (eight CR, four PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of the responders were refractory to prior treatment with rituximab, and two of the responses occurred in patients who had failed an autologous stem cell transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median duration of response was 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most toxicities were low grade and reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, oblimersen <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> can be safely combined with rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The combination appears to be most beneficial in patients with indolent NHL and warrants further investigation in a large randomized trial </plain></SENT>
