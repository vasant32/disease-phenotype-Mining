<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each set of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> shared a common clonal origin, as demonstrated by expression of identical, unique CDR IIIH sequences, shared <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in JH, and identical bcl-2 translocation breakpoints of microdissected ALL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis of lambda V-gene expression demonstrated lambda-bearing cells in the original kappa <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, while expansion of the lambda subclone at relapse occurred after active immunotherapy targeting the Ig receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These exceptional cases are compatible with a more contemporary model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> in which critical events originate from genetic mechanisms which normally occur in germinal center (GC) B cells and challenge the current paradigm of parallel generation of subclones from an early, pre-GC precursor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is also possible that the outgrowth of these variants was a consequence of immunoselection </plain></SENT>
