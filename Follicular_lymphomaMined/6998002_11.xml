<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An essential purpose of a pathologic classification of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is to supply guidance in the clinical management of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ideally, an optimal subclassification should also be scientifically accurate, highly reproducible, and readily teachable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such a system, when used in conjunction with uniform staging, should enable relatively homogeneous groups of patients to be defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have evaluated four new systems for possible additions to the traditional Rappaport classifcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In response to specific questions the following tentative conclusions could be drawn: (1) Within the Rappaport nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, there are no differences in survival between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that are totally nodular verusus those that are nodular and diffuse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(2) In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> composed of small cleaved follicular center cells of the Lukes-Collins system, survival appears to be independent of pattern (follicular, follicular and diffuse, or diffuse) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> classified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e>-centrocytic in the Kiel classification or those classified as large cleaved or large noncleaved in the Lukes-Collins system, a totally or partially follicular pattern confers a better prognosis than its diffuse counterpart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(3) The numbers are small but there is no apparent difference in survival between cases of Rappaport's difuse well differentiated lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with or without plasmacytoid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(4) Within the original Rappaport DPDL there were at least two distinct types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>: (1) a convoluted lymphoblastic that occurs in younger patients has a high frequency of B symptoms and carries a poor prognosis; and (2) a diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that is cytologically identical to nodular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="53413">PDL</z:chebi>, occurs in older patients, and has a relatively good prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In August of 1976 Rappaport modified his classification to recognize these lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> as a distinct clinicopathologic entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(5) In this 22-yr retrospective review, neither the Kiel nor the Lukes-Collins system could identify any relatively favorable subsets within Rappaport's category of diffuse histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies applying the same approach to large numbers of patients subjected to modern uniform staging and aggressive combination chemotherapy may provide data upon which to base an optimal subclassification of DHL </plain></SENT>
