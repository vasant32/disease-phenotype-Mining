<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To characterise a new mouse monoclonal antibody, VS38, which recognises an intracytoplasmic antigen of 64 kilodaltons present in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic plasma cells; and to establish its value as a diagnostic reagent for routine pathological practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A range of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic tissue sections, both frozen and routinely fixed, were immunostained, using the microwave method of antigen retrieval for routinely fixed specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antibody was also tested on blood and bone marrow specimens and a range of human cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The molecular weight of the antigen recognised by the antibody was obtained by western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FACS analysis was used to demonstrate the cellular location of the antigen and its presence on tonsil cell suspensions and <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VS38 recognised <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic plasma cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the tissues, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> routinely fixed plasma cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The antibody also weakly stained epithelial elements within the tissue but was absent from haemopoietic cells of other lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Antibody VS38 is of potential value in identifying <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> in bone marrow or other tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It differentiates lymphoplasmacytoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from lymphocytic and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It also subdivides large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> into two groups which may be a more reliable method of separating these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> than <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> alone </plain></SENT>
