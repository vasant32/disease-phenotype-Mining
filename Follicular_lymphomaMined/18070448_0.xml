<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the genetic aberrations and their pathologic significance in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Paraffin-embedded tissue samples of 55 cases of FL, 28 cases of other small B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 10 cases of reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> were retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect clonal rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH) in FL and other small B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The translocation t (14; 18) was studied by PCR and dual-color fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases of reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Amongst the 55 cases studied, 49 cases were nodal and 6 cases were extranodal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 33 males and 22 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The male-to-female ratio was 1.5:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median age of the patients was 57 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five cases belonged to histologic grade 1, while 19 cases were grade 2 and 11 cases were grade 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Beta-actin DNA was detected in 50 cases of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Amongst those 50 cases, clonal IgH rearrangement was present in 34 (68%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four cases (48%) and 25 cases (50%) were positive for FR3A and FR2 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Fifteen cases (30%) showed dual positivity for both FR3A and FR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four cases (68%) demonstrated clonal IgH rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>As for other small B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 25 cases were positive for beta-actin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>FR3A and FR2 were detected in 18 and 17 cases respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Clonal IgH rearrangement was demonstrated in 24 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In contrast, none of the 4 cases of reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> showed the clonal rearrangement pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Amongst the 44 cases of nodal FL analyzed, t (14; 18) was detected in 15 cases (with 14 cases in MBR and 1 case in mcr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In general, FISH was superior to PCR in detecting t (14; 18) using paraffin-embedded tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The detection rate of clonal IgH rearrangement in FL is lower than that in other small B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Demonstration of t (14; 18) in paraffin-embedded tissue samples by FISH helps in diagnosis of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>FISH is superior to PCR, as the technique is more sensitive and less labor intensive </plain></SENT>
