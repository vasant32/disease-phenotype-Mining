<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is highly associated with the molecular rearrangement BCL2/IGH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although BCL2/IGH has been studied many times in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, its real clinical value remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we performed quantitative testing by real-time polymerase chain reaction in 56 FL patients with median follow-up of 44 months (range, 9-102 months); chemotherapy was administered in 52 of 56 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment numbers of BCL2/IGH varied in wide ranges, with a median of 2947 (range, 0-1,261,013) copies/10(6) cellular equivalent in peripheral blood (PB) and 4650 copies/10(6) cellular equivalent (range, 1-1,056,813) in bone marrow (BM), the difference between PB and BM was significant (pÂ = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of BCL2/IGH quantities were correlated to clinical parameters (e.g., age, stage, sex, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase, B symptoms, grade, bulky disease, chemotherapy regimen) and to progression free-survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Advanced clinical stage (III and IV) and microscopic BM involvement were significantly associated with higher numbers of BCL2/IGH in PB (p &lt; 0.05) and in BM (p = 0.05), regardless <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> or newly diagnosed patients were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High pretreatment burden of BCL2/IGH was associated with significantly shorter progression-free survival; p = 0.003 and p = 0.047 for PB and BM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, pretreatment quantity of BCL2/IGH in PB or BM seems to mirror the extent of disease and can provide an auxiliary prognostic parameter in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results also support evidence of the negative prognostic value of microscopic BM involvement in FL </plain></SENT>
