<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Circulating cells from 666 cases were analyzed with a panel of markers by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diseases included: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), 400; prolymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, 22; hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (HCL), 40; HCL variant, 15; splenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with villous lymphocytes, 100; follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 26; lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 25; mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 20; and large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the most common marker profile in CLL, CD5+, CD23+, FMC7- and weak expression (+/-) of surface immunoglobulin (SmIg) and CD22, we devised a scoring system that gives for each of these five markers a value of 1 or 0 according to whether it is typical or atypical for CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scores range from 5 (typical of CLL) to 0 (atypical for CLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Application of the scoring system to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases showed that 87% of CLL scored 5 and 4 and only 0.4% scored 0 or 1, whereas 89% of other B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and 72% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> scored 0 or 1; only one case (0.3%) scored 4 and none scored 5 (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between CLL with high and low scores but higher scores were found in cases with more typical <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> (p &lt; 0.0015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Considering each individual marker, there was no single one that distinguished CLL from other diseases, although the most reliable were SmIg intensity and FMC7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proposed score will facilitate the diagnosis of B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> and improve their classification </plain></SENT>
