<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), the most common subtype of indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage (III-IV), although patients are often asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Traditionally, a palliative approach to management has been taken, cycling through watchful waiting, radiotherapy, oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> and, eventually, combination chemotherapy, as deemed necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, accumulating evidence suggests that in patients requiring treatment, early initiation of an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based regimen may achieve better response rates and progression-free survival compared with reserving such options until late in the course of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Delivery of myelosuppressive chemotherapy has been facilitated by the availability of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incorporation of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab into upfront chemotherapy regimens further improves outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a trend towards early use of rituximab chemotherapy combinations, median survival appears to have increased in patients with FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A number of issues remain to be addressed by ongoing research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These include identification of the most effective rituximab chemotherapy regimen, the impact of treatment on responsiveness to future treatment, the need for rituximab maintenance therapy and the place of newer treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clearly, there are arguments in favour of considering early aggressive rituximab and chemotherapy regimens in patients with FL requiring treatment, and it is hoped that new prognostic tools will help us to more accurately identify which patients are most likely to benefit </plain></SENT>
