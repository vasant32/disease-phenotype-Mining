<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In FL, at least four independent datasets have confirmed these survival improvements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The monoclonal antibody rituximab has significantly contributed to these improved therapeutic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This issue will explore the impact of monoclonal antibody therapy on outcome in indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and detail how this improved outcome has changed clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the role of monoclonal antibodies in maintenance regimens and the main indications for radiolabeled antibodies will be discussed in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, possible future developments in the field will be proposed, including the use of monoclonal antibodies in ablative transplantation and in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
