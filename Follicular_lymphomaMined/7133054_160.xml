<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three recurrent chromosomal aberrations were found to correlate with certain histologic types: a translocation between chromosomes 18 and 14 in 16 of 19 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (small cleaved cell, mixed cell, and large cell); a translocation between chromosomes 8 and 14 in 5 of 6 patients with small noncleaved-cell (non-Burkitt's) or large-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; and a <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 12 in 4 of 11 patients with small-cell lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that characteristic chromosomal defects occur in certain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes and that high-resolution chromosomal analysis promises to become an important tool in improving our basic understanding of lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
