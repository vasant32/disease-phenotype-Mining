<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The established treatment of limited-stage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is radiotherapy (RT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is an inherent risk of transformation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; however, the frequency and impact on the outcome are unknown in limited-stage patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 237 patients with limited-stage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated with curative intent RT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases were reviewed to determine the frequency of transformation and subsequent survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 7.4 years, the 10-year risk of transformation was 18.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up after transformation of 4.7 years, the 3-year post-transformation progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 42% and 44%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The addition of rituximab improved the 3-year post-transformation PFS and OS compared with combination chemotherapy alone (78% versus 15%, P &lt; 0.00001) and (87% versus 38.5%, P &lt; 0.00001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, only rituximab was associated with OS [HR 0.07 (95% CI 0.015-0.312, P = 0.001)] and PFS [HR 0.19 (95% CI 0.55-0.626, P = 0.007)] following transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a moderate risk of transformation in limited-stage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated with curative intent RT, and it substantially impacts outcome in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with rituximab at the time of transformation appears to improve survival in this otherwise poor-risk population </plain></SENT>
