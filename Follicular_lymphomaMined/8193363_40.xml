<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because this approach requires an individual vaccine for each patient, simple methods for obtaining idiotypic antigen are desirable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with family-based V-gene and J-region primers, the variable region genes of heavy and light chains (VH and VL) of Ig have been obtained from biopsy material from 13 patients with B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each case, analysis of random clones derived from the PCR product showed repeated, clonally-related sequences, whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid tissue generated no repeated sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 3/3 cases, the repeated sequences were found to be the same as those in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-derived hybridoma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutational patterns in the V-genes differed among the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tending to be more highly mutated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The individual VH and VL sequences have been assembled with a flexible linker sequence to encode single-chain Fv (scFv) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The scFv sequences can be cloned into <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> expression vectors to produce protein, or into vectors suitable for direct vaccination using naked DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a model system, expressed scFv protein retained <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> idiotypic determinants defined by a panel of five anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, expressed scFv proteins from two patients were shown to react with anti-idiotypic antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This approach allows production of potential vaccines from surgical biopsies within 2 to 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
