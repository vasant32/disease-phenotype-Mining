<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We established an improved non-radioactive in situ hybridization (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>) method to detect <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of cytokines in cell preparations and tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Via this method we could demonstrate various cytokines in stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), lymphoid cell lines and human lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The probes for the in situ hybridization were made by labelling cytokine-specific PCR products with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42098">digoxigenin</z:chebi> (Dig) in a repeated PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This resulted in an intrinsic labelling of the probe with several Dig-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15713">UTP</z:chebi> molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incorporation of Dig-11-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTPs</z:chebi> was shown on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4883">ethidium bromide</z:chebi>-stained <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gels by a higher molecular weight of the PCR products with incorporated Dig-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTPs</z:chebi> when compared to control PCR products without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42098">digoxigenin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytospin-centrifuged cells of PHA-stimulated PBMC or lymphoid cell lines and frozen sections of various human lymphoid tissues were hybridized with the Dig-labelled cytokine probes and the hybridized probes were detected immuno-histochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this way, we detected and localized cytokine <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10) in PBMC, in the human T-cell line Jurkat, in the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line DoHH2, and in human lymph nodes and tonsils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The in situ hybridization had a high sensitivity as the results correlated closely with the detection of cytokine <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) data from the same samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We showed that Jurkat and DoHH2 cells produce several cytokines constitutively and that, after activation with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>, expression of several cytokine mRNAS was enhanced </plain></SENT>
