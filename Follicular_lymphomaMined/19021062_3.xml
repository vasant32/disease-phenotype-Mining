<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multi-tissue slides obtained from patients with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>; 95 cases), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL; 49 cases) and from non-neoplastic lymph nodes (48 cases) were used for immuhistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High LDH5 expression (cytoplasmic and nuclear) was noted in 79/95 and 29/49 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and FL, respectively (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No expression was noted in non-neoplastic lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, LDH5 expression was significantly related to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> inducible factor HIF1alpha, HIF2alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and phosphorylated vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2/KDR) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In FL, however, a significant relation was confirmed with pVEGFR2/KDR and HIF2alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FL cases with the highest microvessel density were those, which lacked both LDH5 and VEGF expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that LDH5 is highly upregulated in B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and is in direct relation to HIFs expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LDH5 expression is linked with activated VEGFR2/KDR expression in both lymphoid lesions </plain></SENT>
