<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-nine patients with follicular NHL (FL) (N = 41) or small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>) (N = 7) received intravenous epratuzumab 360 mg/m2 and then intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m2 weekly x4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The regimen was tolerated well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-two of 41 patients with FL (54%) had an objective response (OR), including 10 (24%) complete responses (CR) (CR/unconfirmed CR [CRu]), whereas 4 of 7 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e> (57%) had ORs, including 3 (43%) with CR/CRu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rituximab-naive patients (N = 34) had an OR rate of 50% (26% CR/CRu rate), whereas patients who previously responded to rituximab (N = 14) had an OR rate of 64% (29% CR/CRu rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An OR rate of 85% was observed in patients with FL who had Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) risk scores of 0 or 1 (N = 13), whereas 28 patients with intermediate or high-risk FLIPI scores (&gt; or =2) had an OR rate of 39% (18% CR/CRu rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with FL, the median response duration was 13.4 months, and that duration increased to 29.1 months for 10 patients who had a CR/CRu, including 4 patients who had durable responses with remissions that continued for &gt;4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>, the median response duration was 20 months, including 1 patient who had a response that continued for &gt;3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination of epratuzumab and rituximab induced durable responses in patients with recurrent, indolent NHL </plain></SENT>
