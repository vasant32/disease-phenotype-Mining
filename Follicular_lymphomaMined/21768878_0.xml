<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many prognostic models have been suggested to identify high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent gene profiling analysis showed that the clinical behavior of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is determined by the properties of the nonmalignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-associated macrophages (LAMs) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue in patients with newly diagnosed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The LAM was determined immunohistochemically in lymph node tissue sections by anti-CD68 PG-M1 and analyzed through high-power field (HPF) magnification intrafollicularly (IF) and extrafollicularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In our study, the patients who had an IF LAM count equal to or more than 10/HPF had significantly shorter overall survival (P=0.018) and 3 years of progression-free survival (P=0.034) compared with patients with &lt;10 LAM/HPF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis indicated that IF LAM/HPF â‰¥ 10 and Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group performance status &gt;1 are independent prognostic factors for a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
