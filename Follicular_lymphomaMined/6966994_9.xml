<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases studied, the percentage of M rosettes was significantly higher in PB (median 64%) than in bone marrow (median 15%) and lymph node (median 12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These differences were statistically significant (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The possibility that these differences were related to technical factors was ruled out by a number of control procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the different expression of M rosette formation reflects the property which determines whether a lymphocyte enters the peripheral blood or remains fixed in the tissues </plain></SENT>
