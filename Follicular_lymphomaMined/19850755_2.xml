<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>MOTIVATION: Although NHL (non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) is the fifth leading cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence and mortality in the USA, it remains poorly understood and is largely incurable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biomedical studies have shown that genomic variations, measured with SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in genes, may have independent predictive power for disease-free survival in NHL patients beyond clinical measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We apply the CTGDR (clustering threshold gradient directed regularization) method to genetic association studies using SNPs, analyze data from an association study of NHL and identify prognosis signatures to diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), the two most common subtypes of NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the CTGDR method, we are able to account for the joint effects of multiple genes/SNPs, whereas most existing studies are single-marker based </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we are able to account for the 'gene and SNP-within-gene' hierarchical structure and identify not only predictive genes but also predictive SNPs within identified genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, existing studies are limited to either gene or SNP identification, but not both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose using resampling methods to evaluate the predictive power and reproducibility of identified genes and SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Simulation study and data analysis suggest satisfactory performance of the CTGDR method </plain></SENT>
