<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Looking among women alone, this pooled analysis explores the relationship between reproductive histories and these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Self-reported reproductive histories from 4263 women with NHL and 5971 women without NHL were pooled across 18 case-control studies (1983-2005) from North America, Europe and Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Study-specific odd ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using logistic regression and pooled using random-effects meta-analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Associations with reproductive factors were found for FL rather than NHL overall and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In particular, the risk of FL decreased with increasing number of pregnancies (pooled OR(trend) = 0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FL was associated with hormonal contraception (pooled OR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.04-1.63), and risks were increased when use started after the age of 21, was used for &lt;5 years or stopped for &gt;20 years before diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, on the other hand, was not associated with hormonal contraception (pooled OR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.65-1.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hormonal contraception is associated with an increased risk of FL but not of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> or NHL overall </plain></SENT>
