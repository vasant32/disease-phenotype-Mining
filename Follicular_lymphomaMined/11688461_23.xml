<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite its low aggressivity, histologic progression has been described in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> reports, although the frequency, characteristics, and underlying molecular abnormalities of this phenomenon are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We review here the clinical, morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular features of a series of 12 SMZL cases that showed progression to large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (LBCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most frequent location of secondary LBCL was in peripheral lymph node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This occurred between 12 and 85 months after diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in two cases LBCL was diagnosed at the initial stage of the disease (one spleen tumoral nodule and one hilar lymph node) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The histologic and immunophenotypic features of these cases were similar to those of transformed LBCL at other sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In four cases the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene polymerase chain study revealed the same rearrangement pattern in both primary and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">secondary tumors</z:e>, thereby confirming their identity and excluding the possibility of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As is the case with other low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e> may undergo high-grade transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These 12 cases represent 13% of our series of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e> with adequate follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of large cell transformation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e> seems to be lower than in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (25-60%) and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (11-39%), although it is similar to the frequency of transformation in B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1-10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean proliferative index (MIB1 staining) in initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e> specimens of cases with LBCL transformation was 28.6%, higher than that of MIB1 staining in the overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e> series (21.8%), although not statistically significantly so </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>p53 or p16INK4a inactivation in this series was observed in only one case, in contrast with the situation observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It seems that progression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e> is mainly independent of p53 or p16INK4a inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the 7q deletion in this series was 3 of 7 (42%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>7q loss may play an alternative role in the inactivation of the p53 and p16INK4a pathway, thereby favoring tumoral progression </plain></SENT>
