<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Despite the generally favorable clinical course in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), a minority of patients have a poor prognosis-with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 3 years of diagnosis-most often due to transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, we analyzed the potential of predicting early transformation on the basis of gene expression and immunologic parameters in FL biopsy samples taken at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the gene-expression level, FL is a highly uniform disease at the time of diagnosis, precluding the detection of sufficiently validated prognostic gene-expression profiles suitable for a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combinations of differentially expressed genes indicate that immunologic mechanisms play a differential role in the risk of early transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using immunohistochemistry for specific cell populations, the spatial distribution to neoplastic follicles and the activation of CD4-positive T-helper cells (P = .002) and specifically T-helper 1 (P = .004) were shown to be highly discriminatory to predict early transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A role for functional modulation of follicular dendritic cells could also be supported (P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other cell populations, including CD68-positive macrophages and regulatory T cells, were not differentially present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results support the identification of FL as an immunologically functional disease in which an interaction of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and the functional composition of the microenvironment determines the clinical behavior </plain></SENT>
