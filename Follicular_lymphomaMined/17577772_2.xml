<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CMC protocol consisted of 2-CdA at a dose of 0.12 mg/kg in a 2-hour infusion on days 1 through 3, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> 10 mg/m(2) i.v. on day 1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 650 mg/m(2) i.v. on day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CMC courses were repeated at intervals of 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty three patients were available for evaluation of response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall response rate (OR) was 58% (95% CI, 41--75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (21%; 95% CI, 7--35%) achieved a complete response (CR) and 12 patients (36%; 95% CI, 20--52%) achieved a partial response (PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven of 19 patients with CR/PR are still in remission with a median follow-up of 3 months (range, 2-17 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median failure-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e>) was 5 months (range, 2-17 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival (OS) for the entire group was 9 months (range, 0.1-7 months) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When different disease status before CMC treatment was considered, a trend toward longer survival of recurrent patients was observed (log rank test, P = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Grade 3-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> developed in 14 (39%) patients, and 16 episodes (15%) of grade 3-4 infections were observed </plain></SENT>
