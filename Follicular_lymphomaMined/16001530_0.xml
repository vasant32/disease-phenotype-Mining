<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the meantime, virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients can be diagnosed and treated on an ambulatory basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The introduction of the monoclonal antibody rituximab (R) in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, has led to the development of highly potent forms of chemoimmunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the case of aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, R-CHOP has been shown to be significantly superior to CHOP alone, both in elderly and younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In stage III and IV indolent (follicular) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, rituximab/chemotherapy combinations achieve response rates in excess of 90%, and prolonged progression-free survival rates which, for the first time hold out hope of a cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal antibodies that can be coupled to radioisotopes open up new possibilities for potent radioimmunotherapy which look promising for effecting a cure or long-lasting palliation in additional proportion of the patients </plain></SENT>
