<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The long-term effectiveness and toxicity of this strategy, however, is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this prospective study, we analyzed our 8-year experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received a conditioning regimen of fludarabine (30 mg/m(2) daily for 3 days), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (750 mg/m(2) daily for 3 days), and rituximab (375 mg/m(2) for 1 day plus 1000 mg/m(2) for 3 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were then given an infusion of human leukocyte antigen-matched hematopoietic cells from related (n = 45) or unrelated donors (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tacrolimus and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> were used for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients experienced complete remission, with only 2 relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up time of 60 months (range, 19-94), the estimated survival and progression-free survival rates were 85% and 83%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 18 patients who were tested and had evidence of JH/bcl-2 fusion transcripts in the bone marrow at study entry experienced continuous molecular remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of grade 2-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only 5 patients were still undergoing immunosuppressive therapy at the time of last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We believe that the described results are a step forward toward developing a curative strategy for recurrent follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
