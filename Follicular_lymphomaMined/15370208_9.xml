<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study aims to answer the question whether the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) can be practised to international standards at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Registry (LR) established at the Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the study aims to identify differences in the distribution of NHL subtypes at this LR (likely to be representative of India) as compared to the rest of the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A panel of 5 expert hematopathologists from the NHL Classification Project reviewed 200 consecutive NHL cases at the LR in January of 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These cases were accrued during August and September, 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin stains and appropriate immunostains were available for review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis made by the host pathologist at the LR (KNN) and the initial diagnosis made by each of the expert hematopathologists was compared with the consensus diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A consensus diagnosis was made by the 5 experts in 197 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The agreement of the host pathologist with the consensus diagnosis was 82% and the agreement of the individual experts with the consensus diagnosis varied from 76-88% (mean 82%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to the consensus diagnosis, 80% of NHLs were of B-cell type, 18% were of T-cell type, and the immunophenotype could not be determined in the remaining 2% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the WHO classification of NHL was properly utilized at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Registry, Mumbai, India, and geographic differences were noted in the distribution of NHL subtypes at the LR as compared to the rest of the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Precursor T lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was more common in India (7%) than the rest of the world (1-4%), and indolent B-cell NHLs (29%) were less common than in the West </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As compared to China and Japan, peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (4.6%), extranodal NK/T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, nasal type (0.5%) and extranodal marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) (2.6%) were less common, but follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (15%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (5%) were more common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the distribution of the B-cell and T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in the Indian population, except for lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, lies in between the Western world (mainly Caucasian) and the Orientals </plain></SENT>
