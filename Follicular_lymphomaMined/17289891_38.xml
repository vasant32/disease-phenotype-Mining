<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was to determine drug toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> response, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific CD8+ T-cell immune responses, and modulation of CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ regulatory T-cell (Treg) numbers were secondary end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, four with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and four with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first dose was given at 3 mg/kg and subsequent doses were administered monthly at 1.5 mg/kg for a total of four cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>Tumor regression</z:mp> was observed in two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; one of which obtained a partial response of 14-month duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ipilimumab was well tolerated with predominantly grade 1/2 toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One drug-related grade 3 toxicity was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient died within 30 days of treatment due to progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No increase in vaccine-specific T-cell responses was observed after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Tregs as detected by expression of CD4+CD25+CD62L+ declined at early time points but rebounded to levels at or above baseline values at the time of the next infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ipilimumab treatment depressed Treg numbers at early time points in the treatment cycle but was not accompanied by an increase in vaccine-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in these patients previously treated with a variety of investigational anticancer vaccines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A partial response was observed in one patient with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A phase I/II trial evaluating ipilimumab in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is currently ongoing </plain></SENT>
