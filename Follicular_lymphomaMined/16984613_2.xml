<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 27 primary salivary gland <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were examined: 6 FL (five, grade 1; one, grade 2); 19 MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; and two diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The FL patients ranged in age from 24 to 73 years, with a mean of 49 years, which was younger than that of MALT patients (mean: 64 years; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four of the six FL arose from the submandibular gland, which was the origin of only five out of a total of 19 MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One FL patient was in clinical stage (CS) IE, two in CS IIE, and two in CS III and IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As regards the MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, 13 (68%) were in CS IE and five (26%) in CS IIE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the FL patients had clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> but eight MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study found a relatively high incidence of FL in the salivary glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The observed differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, background of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo>, and lesion site suggests that the pathogenesis of FL may differ from that of MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
