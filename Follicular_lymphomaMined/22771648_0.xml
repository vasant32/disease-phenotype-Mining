<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report three elderly patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in situ (FLIS) each highlighting a unique pattern of disease presentation and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first patient had incidentally detected FLIS with peripheral blood spill and yet had an 11-year uneventful follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second patient with an overt follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) developed high-grade transformation in jejunum with FLIS extensively involving the Payers patches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The third patient had a FLIS but that qualified as higher grade and was treated in spite of lack of overt FL mainly because of higher grade and patient subsequently did develop overt FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first case of typical FLIS confirms that peripheral blood spill does not connote poor prognosis in FLIS, the second case illustrates that FLIS may colonize mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue as part of homing in process of a disseminated FL and the third case validates the aggressive nature of high-grade FLIS </plain></SENT>
