<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a case of synchronous GC and nodal ML, regarding which clinical and pathological features and treatment are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 68-year-old woman with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000023'>inguinal hernia</z:hpo> was admitted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> and high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and subsequently underwent herniorrhaphy, but the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> remained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computerized tomography showed a stomach mass and multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000702'>enlarged lymph nodes</z:mp> in the abdominal cavity and inguinal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>Gastric adenocarcinoma</z:mp> coexistent with advanced in situ follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was confirmed by endoscopy, biopsy of inguinal lymph nodes and bone marrow examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two chemotherapy regimens, R-CHOP (rituximab, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, perarubicin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>) and systemic therapy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> and calcium folinate) combined with regional perfusion (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>) through the left gastric artery were performed at intervals against ML and GC, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Partial remission in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> was achieved after 4 courses of treatment, but the patient finally died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Scrupulous biopsy of non-draining lymph nodes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002672'>gastrointestinal carcinomas</z:hpo> is supposed to improve the diagnostic rate of simultaneous nodal ML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The interval chemotherapy strategy with two independent regimens is beneficial for such patients, especially for those unable to tolerate major surgery </plain></SENT>
