<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A variety of chromosomal translocations to the ALL-1 gene are regularly observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> and are thought to play a key role in the leukemogenic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chimeric proteins are encoded by the breakpoint regions of the derivative chromosomes have been proposed to be the relevant oncogenic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, internal duplications of the ALL-1 gene have been observed in patients with specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, it has been hypothesized that oncogenic variants of the ALL-1 protein may be generated by both chimerization and self-fusion, but the critical structural features endowing the altered proteins with their oncogenic potential are still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here a novel structural alteration of the ALL-1 gene was observed in three patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) without chromosomal translocations or self-fusions of the ALL-1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These unrelated patients carried an internal deletion in one of the two alleles of the ALL-1 gene that eliminated parts of introns 7 and 8, together with exon 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The deletion was found in 3 of 74 ALL patients, but not in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, or peripheral blood leukocytes from healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One ALL patient showed the deletion at diagnosis but no longer at remission or at 9 months after remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings support the hypothesis that the ALL-1 protein may be converted to an oncogenic variant, not only by chimerization or self-fusion, but also by deletion of sequences coded by exon 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They further suggest that these three different types of structural alterations of the ALL-1 protein may each cause a distinct disease phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Alternatively spliced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> species omitting exon 8 were observed in 14 of 24 ALL patients without detectable macroscopic alterations of the ALL-1 gene and also in peripheral blood leukocytes from healthy donors </plain></SENT>
