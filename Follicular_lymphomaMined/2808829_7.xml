<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fifteen cases of cutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> were studied immunohistologically with a large panel of monoclonal antibodies to determine their immunoarchitectural composition and to determine whether immunologic criteria recently proposed to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> ever occur in benign <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lesions were composed of T cells, polytypic B cells, macrophages, and Langerhans cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although only six cases containing lymphoid follicles were recognized in routinely stained sections, an additional five were identified in immunoperoxidase-stained sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These follicles were of both the primary and secondary types and contained dendritic reticulum cell networks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotypic features of these follicles were similar to those of reactive follicles in lymphoid organs and contrasted sharply with those reported previously for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Helper T cells were predominant in 11 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With regard to proposed criteria for T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we did not detect loss of pan T cell antigens CD2, CD3, CD5, or BF-1, nor did we find populations of T cells with abnormal co-expression or loss of subset antigens such as CD4-8- or CD4+8+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two cases in which relatively sparse infiltrates were present, however, were moderately CD7-deficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that the CD7 criterion for cutaneous T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> be modified in this situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As observed previously, Leu-8 antigen deficiency was a common, nonspecific finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With regard to proposed criteria for B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we did not detect populations of B cells that were immunoglobulin-negative, nor did we observe preferential loss of one or more B-lineage antigens, histocompatibility complex-associated antigens, or lymphocyte function-associated antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We also did not identify any CD5+ B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On the basis of a comparison of our current data with prior studies of cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, we conclude that the immunologic findings recently proposed as general criteria for the differentiation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> are, in fact, applicable to cutaneous lymphoid lesions </plain></SENT>
