<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Follicular dendritic cells (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi>) are specialized antigen-presenting cells found exclusively in the germinal centre (GC), which can be detected in B cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) as reactive bystander cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, gene expression profiling has revealed that <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> networks might be associated with clinical outcome in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to characterize <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> in NHL and to evaluate a possible association with outcome in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The extent and immunophenotype of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> was determined semi-quantitatively in reactive GC and NHL (follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, angioimmunoblastic T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) using fluorescence double staining and digital image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL tested CD23 and CD35 and CD54 were expressed at relatively low levels on <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi>, comparable to <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> found in the dark zone of the GC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the extent of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> networks did not correlate with the clinical outcome of 102 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> treated within a prospectively randomized trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> found in different types of NHL show quantitatively reduced expression of several proteins, suggesting that there are functional differences between <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GC and NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The extent of the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> networks in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is not useful as a prognostic marker </plain></SENT>
