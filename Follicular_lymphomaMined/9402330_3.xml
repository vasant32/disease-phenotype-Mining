<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, an association between BCL6 rearrangement and frequent extranodal lesions, rare bone marrow infiltration and a favorable clinical outcome was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed molecular studies of the BCL6 gene in 54 patients with NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients (22%) with rearranged BCL6 genes were selected for histological, clinical, molecular, and cytogenetic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten of these cases were diffuse, large cell type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, one a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and one a mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were of the B-cell type and this is the first time a rearranged BCL6 gene has been found in an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic data for 10 cases were available and the partner sites of the 3q27 translocation were determined in 7 of 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These locations were variable, including 6p21.3, 9p22, and 14q11 in addition to the immunoglobulin loci 14q32 (IGH), 2p12 (IGK), and 22q11 (IGL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in partner sites is distinct from other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subgroups and may suggest that the genetic events are not uniform among patients with BCL6 rearrangements </plain></SENT>
