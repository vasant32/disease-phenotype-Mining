<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> cases diagnosed at an institution in southern Taiwan from 1992 to 2007 were retrospectively studied with pathology and history review, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridisation for Epstein-Barr virus (EBER-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>), and statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 70 patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The male to female ratio was 2:1, and the median age was 61.5 years (range 8-87); 73% of cases occurred in Waldeyer's ring or the oral cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phenotypically, there were 45 (64%) B cell and 25 (36%) T cell or extranodal natural killer (NK)/T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ENKL) including 42 (60%) diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e>), 22 (31%) ENKLs, three unspecified peripheral T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, two follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and one Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EBER-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> was positive in three (7%) of 42 DLBCLs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 22 ENKLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most patients received chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall survival for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 56.3% with B and T or NK/T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> at 66.0% and 40.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis revealed that sinonasal presentation, T or NK/T <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp>, raised <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, and Ann Arbor stage III/IV diseases were associated with prognostically significant higher hazard ratio (HR) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, only raised LDH remained significant on multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e>, only raised LDH was prognostically significant on either univariate or multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Only a limited number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> entities occurred primarily in this anatomical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall survival rate was comparable to other reports, and raised LDH at diagnosis was the only significant prognostic factor identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A relatively high incidence of EBV positivity was identified in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> in this anatomical region, and further studies are warranted to elucidate the clinicopathological significance of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
