<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 40 transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were studied, 16 of which had a matched preceding low-grade biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only one transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was found to have a missense mutation at codon 12 of N-ras, resulting in an amino acid change of glycine to serine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conclude that mutation within the ras gene family is a rare event in the transformation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
