<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the value of routine molecular genetic assays, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), in the diagnosis of B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> by fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> (FNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A multiparametric method, including cytology, flow cytometry, PCR, and FISH, was prospectively evaluated in the diagnosis of B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> by FNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aspirates from 30 consecutive patients with suspected hematolymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> aspirates were triaged through a uniform program including cell-size analysis, B- and T-cell clonality studies, flow cytometric immunophenotyping, and bcl-1 and bcl-2 gene rearrangements by PCR and FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After completion of FNA evaluations, FNA results were compared with diagnoses from prior or subsequent surgical biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Monoclonal B-cell populations were detected in 18 of 20 B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> by flow cytometry and PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>bcl-1 gene rearrangement was detected in 2 of 2 cases of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>bcl-2 rearrangement was detected in 5 cases including 4 of 4 low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 1 transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By incorporating the results of molecular genetic and ancillary diagnostics, a definitive classification was reached in 12 cases of B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> by FNA, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (4/4) and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (2/2) and approximately 50% of small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (2/4) and large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (4/8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten of the 12 cases with a final classification reached by FNA had either prior or follow-up surgical biopsies, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 cases showed agreement between the diagnoses rendered on FNA and surgical biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With proper handling and management of specimens, FNA can routinely provide samples adequate for molecular genetic studies, in addition to cytomorphology and flow cytometry, making it possible to consistently render accurate and definitive diagnoses in a subset of B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>By incorporating FISH and PCR methods, FNA may assume an expanded role for the primary diagnosis of B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
