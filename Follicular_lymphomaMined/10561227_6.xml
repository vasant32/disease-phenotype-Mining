<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To analyze beta-integrin expression in non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHLs) in order to assess its distribution among histologic subtypes and correlate with clinical features and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression of alpha2 through alpha6 and beta1 common chains of very late activation antigen (VLA ) molecules and alphaL (CD11a) and beta2 common (CD18) chains of leukocyte function-associated antigen 1 molecule were studied in 137 patients with NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining was performed by a streptavidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> alkaline phosphatase method, and integrin expression was semiquantitatively assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlation with clinical features was analyzed in 80 patients consecutively diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytoma</z:e> (five cases), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (19 cases), mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>; four cases), diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL; 40 cases), lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (LL; six cases), anaplastic Ki-1-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (one case), and other peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (five cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> cells did not show alpha2 and alpha6 expression, whereas most expressed weak to moderate levels of alpha3, alpha4, and alpha5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LL mostly showed alpha2 to alpha5 expression, whereas alpha6 was observed in seven of 11 cases (higher proportion than that shown in other subgroups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alpha chains of VLA molecules were present more frequently in T-cell than in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with moderate/strong alpha4, CD11a, and beta2 common chain expression presented more frequently with advanced stage and bone marrow infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moderate/strong alpha4, alpha5, and beta1 common chain expression correlated with extranodal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the subset of B-cell DLCL patients, negative/weak expression of alpha3 and alpha4 chains was related to a higher complete response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, negative or weak expression of alpha2, alpha3, alpha4, and beta1( )common chain had favorable significance for overall and failure-free survivals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In NHL, beta-integrin expression is related to histologic subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The expression pattern of these molecules probably influences disease dissemination and patients' prognoses </plain></SENT>
