<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to CD10 have been used with flow cytometry and frozen tissue sections and recently have become available for use with paraffin-embedded tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate the utility of CD10 in the differentiation of RFH from FL in paraffin-embedded tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three cases of FL and 19 cases of RFH were evaluated after immunostaining with antibodies to CD3, CD20, BCL2, and CD10 antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intensity of CD10 expression was graded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD10 expression was present in 87% of cases of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follicles demonstrated strong positivity in 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One CD10-positive case of FL showed equivocal staining for BCL2 and one an absence of staining for BCL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Weaker but definite staining was present in 17%, and 13% were negative for CD10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, none of the cases of RFH was strongly positive for CD10 expression, with 26% demonstrating weak immunostaining, one case showing equivocal staining, and 68% being entirely negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CD3, CD20, and BCL2 stained appropriately in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that immunohistochemical staining of paraffin-embedded tissue sections for CD10 may help differentiate reactive from neoplastic follicular lesions </plain></SENT>
