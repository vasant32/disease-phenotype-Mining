<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report 2 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) which was accompanied by Waldenstr√∂m's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024419" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">macroglobulinemia</z:e> (WM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One patient was a 65-year-old woman and the other a 60-year-old man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both patients showed a high level of circulating macroglobulin (4.6 g/dL and 3.6 g/dL, respectively) and bone marrow involvement of small lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in each case, the macroglobulin-producing component and the follicular component were determined to be of the same clone based on their identical light-chain restriction pattern and other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there was a difference in the histopathological characteristics of the macroglobulin-producing components of the 2 patients, especially the cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (Ig)M+ cell distribution in the biopsied lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Test results for the female patient showed intrafollicular proliferation of those cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The male patient's test results showed that IgM+ cells were located in the narrow extrafollicular areas of the lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our observations suggest that at least 2 different subtypes of FL may also be causative of a WM presentation </plain></SENT>
