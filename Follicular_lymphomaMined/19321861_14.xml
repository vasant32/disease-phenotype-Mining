<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), as well as its receptors transmembrane activator and calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand (CAML) interactor (TACI) and B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), has been shown to be important in B-cell biology, and overexpression of APRIL in mice results in development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Limited data are available on APRIL-specific signaling responses, but knockout models suggest that signaling through TACI is critical to B-cell homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To better understand the mechanism by which APRIL exerts its effects and how it may contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e>, we sought to characterize the outcome of APRIL-TACI interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In support of murine studies, we find that APRIL induces proliferation of human patient follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) B cells in a TACI-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study also shows that APRIL is expressed within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> microenvironment and that, upon engagement with TACI, APRIL mediates activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Activation of PI3K via APRIL results in phosphorylation of Akt and mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> (mTOR) and the mTOR-specific substrates p70S6 kinase and 4E-binding protein 1 in a TACI-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>APRIL-mediated signaling also results in phosphorylation of Rb and up-regulation of cyclin D1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies are the first to characterize APRIL-TACI-specific signaling and suggest a role for this ligand-receptor pair in FL B-cell growth </plain></SENT>
