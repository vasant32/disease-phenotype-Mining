<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> with signet ring cell features (LSF) is a rare morphologic variant of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although it has been well documented in the surgical pathology literature, to the best of the authors's knowledge, the features of LSF in fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> (FNA) samples have rarely been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An accurate cytologic diagnosis of LSF is of important therapeutic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed 7 FNA cases of LSF for cytologic features, ancillary studies, corresponding histologic findings, and the patients' clinical and radiologic information to illustrate the diagnostic clues and potential pitfalls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The final diagnoses, based on a multidisciplinary approach, were follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (5 patients), large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of follicular center cell origin (1 patient), and low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with plasmacytoid features (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FNAs were obtained from both lymph node and extranodal sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Common cytologic features included various percentages of signet ring cells in a background of nonvacuolated lymphomatous cells, lymphoglandular bodies, and cytoplasmic rings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of signet ring cells contained a single, large, clear intracytoplasmic vacuole that pushed the nucleus laterally whereas fewer cells contained ≥ 2 vacuoles that indented the nucleus into a scalloped or stellate configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These cells resemble, to some degree, other lesions with signet ring cell features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One of the diagnostic clues of LSF was the similarity in nuclear details between signet ring cells and surrounding nonvacuolated lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Familiarity with cytologic features, correlation with clinical/radiologic information, and ancillary studies are important for an accurate diagnosis of LSF and for distinguishing it from other lesions with signet ring cell features in FNA samples </plain></SENT>
