<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A dose-dependent decrease in Bcl-2 protein expression was observed in the different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> incubated with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-incorporated bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotides (L-bcl-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Growth inhibition was observed in a transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) cell line, which has the t(14;18) translocation and Bcl-2 protein overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the mechanisms by which L-bcl-2 growth inhibition is mediated in these transformed FL cells might be through apoptotic induction, because the treated cells had an increased apoptotic index and showed the typical DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These studies indicate that Bcl-2 protein is critical in the growth regulation of transformed FL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>L-bcl-2 did not induce growth inhibition in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells not expressing Bcl-2 or Bax protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the protein ratio of Bcl-2/Bax may also be important in regulating the growth of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
