<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although studies comparing conventional imaging modalities with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET) for the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and although the relations between (18)F-FDG-PET and histologic types were reported previously, most studies were not systematic and involved relatively small numbers of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred fifty-five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had their disease staged using (18)F-FDG-PET, and 191 of those patients also were assessed using <z:chebi fb="29" ids="49631">gallium</z:chebi>-67 scintigraphy ((67)Ga) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Disease sites were identified on a site-by-site basis using computed tomography scans and/or magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of these conventional imaging modalities were compared with the results from (8)F-FDG-PET and (67)Ga, and correlations between the imaging results and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1513672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathologic diagnoses</z:e> were evaluated by using the World Health Organization classification system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 913 disease sites in 255 patients, (18)F-FDG-PET identified &gt;97% of disease sites of Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>) and aggressive and highly aggressive non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the detection rate of (18)F-FDG-PET was 91% for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL); 82% for extranodal marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, irrespective of plasmacytic differentiation; and approximately 50% for small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>) and splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results from (67)Ga were similar to those from (18)F-FDG-PET for most histologic subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the sensitivity of (67)Ga was unexpectedly poor for FL, for mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>), and for the nasal type of natural killer/T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NK/T-nasal), ranging from 30% to 38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: (18)F-FDG-PET was useful for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> histologic subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMZL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with (67)Ga, the authors strongly recommend the use of (18)F-FDG-PET in patients with FL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, and NK-nasal </plain></SENT>
