<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A subset of dendritic cells called germinal center dendritic cells (GCDC) has recently been described inside germinal center from reactive lymphoid organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated this newly recognized population in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), which is considered to be the pathologic counterpart of germinal center B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry analysis with a panel of antibodies demonstrated the presence of a cell population with the peculiar GCDC phenotype in FL biopsies and a similar localization of these cells inside tumoral and reactive follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we analyzed the relationships between GCDC and the other cell subsets of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes present inside the follicle were found to be in close association with GCDC, suggesting a potential implication of GCDC in their activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the distribution of GCDC inside FL and reactive follicles did not appear disrupted, in contrast to follicular dendritic cells, the other follicle dendritic cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we demonstrated that GCDC could be detected from FL lymph node cell suspension by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results indicate that FL development is not associated with a disappearance of GCDC or with a lack of physical interactions between GCDC and T cells inside the follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the fact that GCDC can be observed in FL samples by flow cytometry should allow their purification to further study their putative role in FL development and maintenance </plain></SENT>
