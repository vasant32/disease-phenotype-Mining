<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We treated seven patients with DLI for indolent non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> relapsed after SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In available blood and bone marrow samples, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were analysed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction of t(14;18)-positive cells in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and by immunophenotyping in small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before DLI, three patients were treated with chemo- and/or radiotherapy, and one with rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evaluable responses to pre-DLI therapy were stable disease in one and partial remission (PR) in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients responded to DLI (complete remission (CR) in four and PR in two) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After DLI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) occurred in 3/6 patients, classified as grade 2, whereas only limited <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was seen (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The four continuous CR are lasting for median 65+ (43-89) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the remaining patient, not responding to DLI, progressive disease was seen later on; chemotherapy followed by another DLI resulted in CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In three cases, clinical responses to DLI could be substantiated by molecular or immunophenotypic analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that DLI is effective for treatment of indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> relapsing after SCT </plain></SENT>
