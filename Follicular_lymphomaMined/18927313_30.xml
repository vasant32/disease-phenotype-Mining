<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between the C1qA([276]) polymorphism and the clinical response to rituximab in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Genotyping for C1qA([276A/G]) was done in 133 subjects with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated with single-agent rituximab, and correlation with clinical response was done using Cox regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prolonged remission was observed among subjects that responded clinically to rituximab therapy and were carriers of the A allele compared with homozygous G subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Homozygous G subjects had a time to progression of 282 days, whereas A-allele carriers had a time to progression of 708 days [hazard ratio, (HR), 2.5; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 2.0-3.1; P = 0.02] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among subjects who achieved complete remission, homozygous G subjects had a time to progression of 250 days, whereas A-allele carriers had a time to progression of 1,118 days (HR, 4.5; 95% CI, 4.1-4.8, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference persisted after controlling for CD32 and CD16 polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients who responded to rituximab used as first-line agent, a linear trend was observed among the C1qA([276]) genotypes, with homozygous A subjects achieving complete response at a higher rate compared with heterozygous or homozygous G subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that polymorphisms in the C1qA gene may affect the clinical response and duration of response to rituximab therapy of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results could have direct implications on designing antibodies with improved efficiency and enhance our understanding of the role of complement in monoclonal antibody therapy </plain></SENT>
