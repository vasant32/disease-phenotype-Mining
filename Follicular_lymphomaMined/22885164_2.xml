<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prognostic role of FCGR3A and FCGR2A polymorphisms in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated with rituximab and chemotherapy combination remains controversial and has not been evaluated in the context of rituximab maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FCGR3A and FCGR2A single nucleotide polymorphisms were evaluated in, respectively, 460 and 455 patients treated in the PRIMA study to investigate whether these were associated with response rate and patient outcome after rituximab chemotherapy induction and 2-year rituximab maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this representative patient cohort, complete and unconfirmed complete responses after rituximab chemotherapy were observed in 65%, 67%, 66% (P = .86) and 60%, 72%, 66% (P = .21) of FCGR3A VV, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>, FF and FCGR2A HH, HR, RR carriers, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 2 years of rituximab maintenance (or observation), response rates did not differ among the different genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival measured from either treatment initiation or randomization to observation or maintenance was not influenced by these polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that FCGR3A and FCGR2A polymorphisms do not influence response rate and outcome when rituximab is combined with chemotherapy or used as maintenance treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The PRIMA study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00140582 </plain></SENT>
