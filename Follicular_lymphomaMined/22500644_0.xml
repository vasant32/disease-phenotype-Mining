<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Few studies have statistically investigated reduced CD20 expression in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> after rituximab therapy and genomic mutation of CD20 associated with reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined CD20-positive rate in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) by flow cytometry (FCM) and immunohistochemical staining (IHS), comparing 138 cases after rituximab therapy with 360 initial, not yet treated cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of exons 3 to 8 of CD20 was performed on 22 cases with low CD20-positive rate after rituximab treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed a statistical correlation between CD20-positive rate in FCM and IHS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By FCM, the CD20-positive rate among post-rituximab cases was significantly lower than among initial cases in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, non-germinal center origin B-cell type (average values [avg] 57.8 and 87.9, respectively) (P &lt; 0.0001), FL2 (avg, 93.9; 103.2) (P = 0.0083), and FL3A (avg, 90.6; 100.7) (P = 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stratified analyses of post-rituximab cases showed significantly lower CD20-positive rate in cases that were resistant at the start of the treatment and cases with progressive disease during rituximab therapy before biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis showed silent mutation of exon 4 (632 C/T) in seven cases, although this number was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the influence of B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtype and a therapeutic effect before biopsy on CD20 expression at relapse and contribute to a better therapeutic approach for relapse cases after rituximab therapy </plain></SENT>
