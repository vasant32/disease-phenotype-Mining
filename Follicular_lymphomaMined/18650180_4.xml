<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study was conducted to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of this strategy in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We constructed a transition state model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of extended adjuvant rituximab for 2 years for patients having a second FL remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Event-free and OS rates were estimated from the recently published Intergroup trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These were adjusted to reflect the contribution of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific mortality for patients aged 65-70 years, a more commonly affected age group than in the Intergroup trial, which had a median age of 54 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Previously reported quality of life and cost estimates were obtained from peer-reviewed sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five years after a second induction with R-CHOP (rituximab with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>/ <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>), disease-free survival is expected to be 47% and 22%, and the OS rates are estimated to be 73% and 61% for extended adjuvant rituximab and observation, respectively, during the second remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the addition of adjuvant rituximab is estimated to be $19,522 per quality-adjusted life-years gained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Extended adjuvant rituximab offers a clinical benefit to patients aged 65-70 years who have a second remission from FL at a cost generally acceptable to the US healthcare system </plain></SENT>
