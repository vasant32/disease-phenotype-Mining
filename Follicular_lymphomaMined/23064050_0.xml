<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this context we evaluated additional cases to further confirm that hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report on 2 additional cases in which clonal cytogenetic abnormalities were observed in otherwise morphologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case 1 is a bone marrow from a 73 year old male with transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), while case 2 is a lymph node from a 53-year-old with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, both referred to the cytogenetics laboratory for evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 73-year-old male presented with an enlarging left inguinal mass surrounding and obliterating the left iliac vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A tissue core biopsy of the mass revealed recurrent high grade FL with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Examination of a random bone marrow biopsy of the adjacent left posterior iliac crest showed only mild hypercellularity (50%) and no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, and the results were confirmed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic evaluation revealed an interstitial deletion, del (9)(q13q32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In case 2, morphologically the lymph node showed extensive paracortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> with numerous eosinophils and no clear indication of a neoplastic process with no abnormal lymphoid population observed by flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PCR studies for TCR gamma and IgH gene rearrangements were negative for clonality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Chromosome analysis demonstrated 47,XY,+add(1)(p22),t(3;14)(q27;q11.2)[13]/46,XY[7] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>FISH studies showed a BCL6 gene rearrangement but no TCRAD rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A subsequent inguinal lymph node biopsy showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These cases along with the other cases in the literature provide further evidence of genetic abnormalities preceding morphological abnormalities in developing malignant conditions </plain></SENT>
