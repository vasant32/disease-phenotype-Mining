<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with the t(14;18) translocation, there is increased expression of the bcl-2 gene, which is dependent upon regulatory elements within the bcl-2 5' flanking region and the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene enhancers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that t(14;18) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> expressed C/EBPalpha, which is not normally expressed in B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of C/EBPalpha increased bcl-2 expression, and two regions of the bcl-2 P2 promoter that mediated this effect were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>C/EBPbeta was also able to increase bcl-2 promoter activity through these sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 5' site was GC-rich and did not contain a C/EBP consensus sequence; however, C/EBP was observed to interact with this site both in vitro by EMSA and in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 3' region contained the Cdx site, which mediates the effect of A-Myb on the bcl-2 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo binding studies revealed that C/EBP interacted with this region of the bcl-2 promoter as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Decreased expression of C/EBP factors due to targeting of their transcripts by siRNA molecules resulted in downregulation of Bcl-2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta contribute to the deregulated expression of Bcl-2 in t(14;18) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
