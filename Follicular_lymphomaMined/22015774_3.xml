<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidences indicate that the cellular and molecular microenvironment of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) has a key role in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> and patient outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Malignant FL B cells are found admixed to specific stromal and immune cell subsets, in particular CD4(pos) T cells displaying phenotypic features of follicular helper T cells (T(FH)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of our study was to functionally characterize intratumoral CD4(pos) T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We showed that CXCR5(hi)ICOS(hi)CD4(pos) T cells sorted from FL biopsies comprise at least two separate cell populations with distinct genetic and functional features: (i) CD25(pos) follicular regulatory T cells (T(FR)), and (ii) CD25(neg) T(FH) displaying a FL-B cell supportive activity without regulatory functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, despite their strong similarities with tonsil-derived T(FH), purified FL-derived T(FH) displayed a specific gene expression profile including an overexpression of several genes potentially involved directly or indirectly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e>, in particular TNF, LTA, IL4 or CD40LG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we further demonstrated that these two last signals efficiently rescued malignant B cells from spontaneous and rituximab-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Altogether, our study demonstrates that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-infiltrating CD4(pos) T cells are more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> than previously presumed, and underlines for the first time the crucial role of T(FH) in the complex set of cellular interactions within FL microenvironment </plain></SENT>
