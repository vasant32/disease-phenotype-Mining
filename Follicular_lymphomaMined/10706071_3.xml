<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Essential mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100778'>cryoglobulinemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMC</z:e>) type II is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus (HCV) in 90% of the patients with this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A significant subset of these patients is at risk to develop non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to examine whether the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMC</z:e>, a presumably premalignant step of lymphoproliferation, is associated with changes in the replication state of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> structural genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group included three subgroups: (1) seven patients with HCV without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMC</z:e>; (2) eight patients with HCV associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; and (3) six healthy individuals served as control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Monocolor fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes to p53, RB-1, and 21q22 was applied to leukocytes nuclei for the evaluation of replication timing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Asynchronous replication (SD) rate was similar in patients with NHL and those with HCV associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMC</z:e> and both are significantly higher when compared to patients with HCV without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMC</z:e> and to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p &lt; 0.01) for each comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This held true for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studied loci (21q22, RB-1, and p53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients infected by HCV (but without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMC</z:e>) had a significantly higher rate of asynchronous pattern in comparison with healthy controls (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a "premalignant" clinical condition HCV with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMC</z:e> already demonstrate asynchronous type of replication which is similar to patients who already have an established malignant disease (i.e., NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the future, replication may be used to assess the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> in patients with "benign" proliferation </plain></SENT>
