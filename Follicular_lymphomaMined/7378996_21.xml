<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complete, partial or minor SR was found in 18 out of 140 cases with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in 2 out of 69 cases with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, SR occurs far more frequently in nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> than in the diffuse type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within the nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> group, SR is associated with long survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It occurred in previously treated and untreated patients and in nodal and extranodal disease; the duration varied from a few weeks to many years but lasted one year or more in 7 cases with complete or partial SR </plain></SENT>
