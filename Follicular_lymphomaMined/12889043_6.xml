<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, studies evaluating the usefulness of FC in serous cavity effusions (SCE) are few </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective review of 115 consecutive SCE with concurrent FC analysis, comparing the provisional cytopathologic diagnosis (PCD), i.e., before the FC results were added, with final diagnoses as modified by subsequent FC immunophenotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The predominant clinical indication for the FC analysis was the presence of a spontaneous SCE in a patient with a history of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three- or four-color analysis was performed using antibodies against CD45, CD71, CD33, CD22, CD19, CD20, kappa, lambda, CD5, CD3, and CD56 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The PCD was benign in 47%, atypical in 16%, and malignant in 37% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latter category consisted mostly of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 32), but also included <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (1 case), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005517'>T-cell lymphoma/leukemia</z:hpo> (2 cases), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (1 case), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (1 case), Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1 case), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> (1 case), and <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (4 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 18 cases (16%), the PCD was later modified by the FC results from atypical/suspicious to benign (8) and from benign or atypical/suspicious to malignant (10 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The latter group included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> natural killer (NK) cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (1 case), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (1 case), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (2 cases), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (3 cases), angioimmunoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1 case), large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1 case), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As expected, FC was noncontributory in cases of Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and nonlymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, immunophenotyping by FC modified the PCD significantly in 16% of SCE, permitting appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> staging and management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The above data underscore the importance of FC as an adjunct to cytomorphology in SCE </plain></SENT>
