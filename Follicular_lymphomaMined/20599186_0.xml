<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To characterize the differentiating histopathologic and immunophenotypic features of reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> (RLH) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the ocular adnexa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective case study with clinical follow-up and review of the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical records of 9 cases of RLH and 6 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from 2 institutions were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Light microscopic evaluation and immunohistochemical stains including CD20, CD3, CD5, CD21, CD23, BCL-2, BCL-6, CD10, kappa, lambda, and Ki67 were used to distinguish the 2 categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RLH preferentially involved the conjunctiva, whereas follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had a propensity to involve the lacrimal gland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microscopic analysis with immunohistochemical staining distinguished RLH from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BCL-2 was positive in follicular centers of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but not in RLH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD10 identified follicular center cells and Ki67 quantified cells in S-phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD21 and CD23 detected dendritic cell scaffoldings of indistinct germinal centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with RLH developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> during their clinical courses (up to 18 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, 3 patients with orbital, but not conjunctival, RLH developed immunohistochemically proven multifocal nonophthalmic supradiaphragmatic adnexal RLH (sites included lung, parotid, axillary nodes, and uvea) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 6 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had disseminated disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A correct diagnosis of RLH vs follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> can be reliably established employing immunohistochemical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A heretofore undescribed "multifocal RLH" syndrome must be distinguished from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Conjunctival RLH can usually be managed surgically without radiotherapy, but "multifocal RLH" required systemic treatment in 2 of 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> requires systemic chemotherapy if discovered beyond stage 1E </plain></SENT>
