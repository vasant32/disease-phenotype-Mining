<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among a survey of 60 primary previously untreated, clonal, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> we have identified a rare V(H) rearrangement variant and two other in-frame nucleotide insertion/deletion variants within complementarity-determining region III of the Ig heavy chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neoplastic origin of the V(H) rearrangement variant was directly demonstrated in cells isolated by microdissection from malignant follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases a common clonal origin for the variants was demonstrated by complementarity-determining region III nucleotide sequence homology and shared <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in germline encoded positions in framework region IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The monoclonal nature of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> was independently confirmed by demonstrating a single t(14;18) translocation breakpoint in the two cases with a detectable translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the variants occurred in functional V(H) rearrangements, which in two cases were directly shown to encode functional Ab molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both recombination-activating genes 1 and 2 were expressed in lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells containing the V(H) rearrangement variant, although recombination-activating gene expression among a panel of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was not limited to this variant </plain></SENT>
