<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among these, the <z:chebi fb="13" ids="29357,29358">methylene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20506,26907">tetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase gene (MTHFR) encodes an enzyme that converts <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> to a <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> donor used for DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the association between the different genotypes of the two most common MTHFR polymorphisms, C677T and A1298C, and the risk of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, 55 previously diagnosed FL patients and 170 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects were examined using polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the A1298C CC homozygous mutant genotype was significantly higher in patients with FL than in control subjects (OR = 3.51, 95% CI = 1.39-8.86, P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No such association was found for the heterozygous A1298C AC genotype (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.55-2.12, P = 0.83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, no significant association was found for either the C677T CT heterozygous genotype (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.42-1.51, P = 0.49) or the C677T TT homozygous mutant genotype (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.12-2.65, P = 0.46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present findings add to the very few reports suggesting a link between the A1298C CC homozygous MTHFR genotype and a higher risk of developing FL, and the first such in a Jordanian population </plain></SENT>
