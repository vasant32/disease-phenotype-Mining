<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To confirm the clinicopathologic significance of these mainly large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with an epithelioid cell response (LBCL-ER), we reviewed 50 patients with LBCL-ER and compared the results with those of 167 other diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and 94 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) without epithelioid response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients with LBCL-ER showed a higher age distribution (median 71, P =.03), a female predominance (M:F = 18:32, P =.001) and less frequent involvement of extranodal sites &gt;1 (P =.004) compared with those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, and presented with a bulky mass of the affected lymph nodes in 54% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were also older (P =.0006) and more associated with the aggressive clinical factors such as serum LDH level and International Prognostic Index score than those with FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histologically, nine cases (18%) partially showed a follicular growth pattern, and the others (82%) were occupied by a diffuse growth pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The epithelioid cells were accumulated in large demarcated masses, partially imparting a lymphoepithelioid (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1621719" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lennert</z:e>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-like appearance to some portions of the lesions in every case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, LBCR-ER was positive for CD20 in every case, CD10 in 43% of the cases, and BCL-2 in 56% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in the 40 cases tested expressed CD5 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining also often highlighted the remnants of the follicular dendritic cell network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The BCL-2 gene rearrangement was detected in only 19% of the cases examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The survival curve of the cases of LBCL-ER was almost identical with that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and was significantly inferior to that of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e>/centrocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with an epithelioid cell response may be regarded as the morphologic variant of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> preferentially arising in the aged population and reflecting the disease progression of FL </plain></SENT>
