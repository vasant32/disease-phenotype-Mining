<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In Germany, patients with relapsed follicular non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> do not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> receive the same treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, 3 therapy regimens were analyzed which were considered to be similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the goal of determining the treatment option with the lowest direct costs whilst maintaining the same degree of effectiveness, a cost analysis model was established and applied by way of example to the existing illness constellation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The German doctors' fee scale (Einheitlicher Bewertungsmassstab, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EBM</z:e>) valid until 2005 served as the basis for the calculation of medical services within the scope of the present statutory health insurance guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A virtual standard patient was constructed for the cost model and treated with the different therapy regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidences of individual adverse events described in literature served as the basis for the characterization of the average toxicity of the respective treatment methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT: The overall costs result from the sum of the treatment costs and the toxicity-related costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of additional interventions on the overall cost was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Whereas the accompanying documentation of costs in clinical studies is organizationally complex and very tedious, the model applied here offers a reliable method of quantifying the costs of the different therapy regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It permits the comparison of different treatment alternatives, and it enables, by means of a cost variance analysis, the identification of cost drivers and less expensive measures within a therapy method </plain></SENT>
