<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The overall median survival was 78 months with a five-year survival of 62% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The complete remission rate was 76%, with a median relapse-free interval of 72 months for responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete remission produced a significantly longer survival than partial response and failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who tolerated therapy with an intensive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-containing regimen had a significantly longer relapse-free interval and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with stage I-II disease treated with radiation therapy alone had a higher relapse rate than those treated with radiation and combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The addition of radiation therapy to combination chemotherapy in stage III-IV disease decreased the incidence of relapse at irradiated sites, but did not translate into improved survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment prognostic factors associated with poor response were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> and stage III-IV disease; those associated with shortened survival were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo>, elevated lactic dehydrogenase level, stage III-IV disease, and bulky abdominal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follicular large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is an aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment should be curative in intent, and should include intensive combination chemotherapy even in stage I-II disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of important prognostic factors can be useful for analysis of future trials and planning therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
