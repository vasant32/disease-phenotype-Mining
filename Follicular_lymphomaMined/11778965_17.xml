<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 104 patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular or diffuse large-B-cell-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, in order to evaluate the correlation between clinical characteristics and immunohistochemical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining was performed by means of monoclonal antibodies against Ki-67, bcl-2, and p53 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine of the patients showed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A high expression of bcl-2 was found in 93%, high expression of p53 in 57%, and low expression of Ki-67 in 96% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade III showed a p53 expression (p = 0.07) slightly higher than follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grades I and II, not reaching statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grades I and II tended to express lower Ki-67 and higher levels of bcl-2 expression than grade III (p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five cases showed diffuse large-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among them, bcl-2 was absent in 39%, whereas p53 and Ki-67 expression were high in 38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the diffuse large-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, a high bcl-2 expression correlated with stages III and IV (p = 0.03) and involvement of more than one extranodal area (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High Ki-67 expression was also associated to extranodal involvement of more than one area (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall survival of patients did not show statistically significant differences regarding Ki-67, bcl-2, and p53 tumoral expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prognostic factors for overall survival in the multivariate analysis were age (p = 0.02) and LDH (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Time to progression was worse among follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with high p53 expression than with mild/moderate p53 expression (p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
