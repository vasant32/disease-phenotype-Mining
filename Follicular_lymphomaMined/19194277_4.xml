<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a series of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) cases diagnosed in the spleen, consisting of 32 patients who presented clinically with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, and slight or no peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The splenic specimen had a micronodular pattern, germinal center cytologic composition, and frequent presence of marginal zone-like cells at the periphery of the nodules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty cases showed absence or only partial/weak bcl2 protein expression, and 12 cases had homogeneous and strong positive bcl2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidences of t(14;18)(q32;q21), CD10 expression, low histologic grade, and low proliferative index were significantly more frequent in FL bcl2-positive cases than in FL bcl2-negative cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Splenic FL cases showed frequent relapses, with an overall survival of 55% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in survival were found between bcl2-negative and bcl2-positive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Splenic FL cases could be divided into 2 main variants: one was similar to classic FL with t(14;18) and CD10 expression, whereas the other was characterized by a higher proliferation index and histologic grade, and was more frequently diagnosed as a disease restricted to the spleen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recognition of the distinct nature of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> should facilitate appropriate studies for determining the best therapy for such cases </plain></SENT>
