<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle kinetic studies seemed to differentiate distinctly between low grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 8, LI = 2.6%) compared to that of intermediate grade (n = 9, LI = 13%, p = 0.0001) and high grade NHL (n = 5, LI = 16.3%, p = 0.0062) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While the majority of 14 intermediate and high grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had a high labeling index there were 3/14 patients with a LI of 5.5%, 5.5% and 4.1% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A decrease in the rate of programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (PCD) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> due to the overexpression of bcl-2 has been implicated as the possible pathogenesis for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We determined the presence of bcl-2 protein immunohistochemically and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by in situ end labeling of DNA which detects cells in early stages of PCD not recognized morphologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine NHL patients demonstrated PCD ranging from 1%-40%, while it was undetectable in 13/22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these 13 cases, 6 showed the presence of bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To understand the relationship of the microenvironment to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, the presence of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) was determined immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TGF-beta was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases where bcl-2 was present, except one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study highlights some of the key biological features of NHL cells and their microenvironment </plain></SENT>
