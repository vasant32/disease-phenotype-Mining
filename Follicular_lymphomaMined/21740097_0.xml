<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Published studies have provided conflicting results regarding the curative potential of high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (HDT/ASCT) for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objectives were to evaluate the long-term event-free (EFS) and overall (OS) survival rates following ASCT for FL, and to identify predictors of improved outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a retrospective analysis of the first 100 consecutive patients with relapsed or refractory FL treated with HDT/ASCT in Calgary from 1993 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 65 months (range 16-178) post-ASCT, 5-year EFS and OS rates were 56% (95% confidence interval [CI] 46-66%) and 70% (95% CI 61-79%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A plateau on the EFS curve is evident starting 6 years post-ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, the EFS post-ASCT was markedly longer than the 12-month median EFS from last therapy prior to ASCT (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Failure of rituximab pre-ASCT was not associated with EFS or OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severe toxicities included two early treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, and four late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of EFS and OS in multivariate analysis were rituximab therapy within 6 months of ASCT, chemosensitivity and FLIPI (FL International Prognostic Index) score 0-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data suggest that over 50% of patients with relapsed/refractory FL who have failed 1-2 prior chemotherapy regimens achieve long-term EFS following HDT/ASCT </plain></SENT>
