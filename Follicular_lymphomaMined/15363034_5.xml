<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rituximab is widely used for the treatment of B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), and encouraging results have been obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, some CD20-positive NHL show minimal response to rituximab, indicating that the treatment effect depends on the presence or absence of an unidentified factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the relationship between the effect of rituximab plus chemotherapy and expression of Ki-67, p53 and bcl-2 and several clinical variables in cases of B-NHL, particularly follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-four patients were included in the present study, and the overall treatment response rate was 68% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve of 30 patients (40%) achieved a complete response, five (16%) reached an unconfirmed complete response and 13 (43%) achieved a partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A high serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase level and International Prognostic Index of high or high intermediate risk were associated with a decreased response in the case of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical assays were performed in 18 FL patients (55%) and 15 DLBCL patients (45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant correlation was found between an inferior response to treatment and high Ki-67 expression in the cases of FL (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>p53 and bcl-2 expression did not correlate significantly with the response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cell cycle appears to be an important factor in the efficacy of rituximab treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ki-67 expression might be a predictor of efficacy of rituximab plus chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
