<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We developed a novel approach for conducting multisample, multigene, ultradeep <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing analysis of DNA methylation patterns in clinical samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A massively parallel sequencing-by-synthesis method (454 sequencing) was used to directly sequence &gt;100 bisulfite PCR products in a single sequencing run without subcloning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We showed the utility, robustness, and superiority of this approach by analyzing methylation in 25 gene-related CpG rich regions from &gt;40 cases of primary cells, including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood lymphocytes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 294,631 sequences was generated with an average read length of 131 bp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On average, &gt;1,600 individual sequences were generated for each PCR amplicon far beyond the few clones (&lt;20) typically analyzed by traditional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive analysis of CpG methylation patterns at a single DNA molecule level using clustering algorithms revealed differential methylation patterns between diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in methylation was detected in ALL and FL samples compared with CLL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a progressive spreading of methylation was detected from the periphery toward the center of select CpG islands in the ALL and FL samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ultradeep sequencing also allowed simultaneous analysis of genetic and epigenetic data and revealed an association between a single nucleotide polymorphism and the methylation present in the LRP1B promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This new generation of methylome sequencing will provide digital profiles of aberrant DNA methylation for individual human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and offers a robust method for the epigenetic classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> subtypes </plain></SENT>
