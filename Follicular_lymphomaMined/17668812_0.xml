<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most predominant localization for extranodal NHL in the head and neck region is the tonsil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of NHL at this site are B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, extranodal marginal zone B-cell of MALT type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The authors presented the case of primary extranodal non Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the right tonsil in patient with the long history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011110'>tonsillitis</z:hpo> and after bilateral tonsillectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The affected tonsil together with enlarged lymph node was surgically removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The histologic examination detected follicular (nodular) non Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, grade 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was refered to the Hematology and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Department for additional treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the Hematology and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Department staging was conducted recognizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>--clinical stage I according to Ann Arbor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with R-COP regiment (six cycles rituximab + COP- cyclophosphamid, vincristin, prednisolon) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The complete remission was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient is in observation period both in Otolaryngology and Hematology Department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Recurrent, non-typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011110'>tonsillitis</z:hpo> with enlarged neck nodes may be follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>'s symptom, especially in older patients </plain></SENT>
