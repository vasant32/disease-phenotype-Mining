<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have retrospectively analyzed patients with chemosensitive disease and a history of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who underwent high-dose chemoradiotherapy and bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with anti-B cell monoclonal antibody-purged autologous marrow for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between December 1982 and August 1997, 27 patients underwent autologous BMT using a uniform ablative regimen with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, total-body irradiation, and bone marrow purging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received multiple chemotherapy regimens before autologous BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At bone marrow (BM) harvest, only 44% of patients were in complete remission, and overt BM infiltration was present in 37% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and total-body irradiation, no treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 27 patients relapsed, and four patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients remained alive and in complete remission with a median follow-up of 36 months (range 10-132) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The disease-free survival and overall survival are estimated to be 46% (90% confidence interval 28-64) and 58% (40-76) at 5 years, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Selected patients with histologic transformation, particularly those whose transformation occurs early in the course of their disease and who remain chemosensitive, may experience prolonged survival after autoBMT </plain></SENT>
