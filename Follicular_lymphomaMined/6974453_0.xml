<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes in the germinal center and thymic cortex were mostly negative for the receptors, while most of the lymphocytes in the thymus-dependent area, some of those in the primary follicle or in the marginal zone and most of the plasma cells in the medulla possessed the receptors on their surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100522'>thymomas</z:hpo>, and diffuse lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were mostly negative in contrast to the positive reaction in diffuse poorly differentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of B-cell type and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">plasmocytomas</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffuse histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and diffuse mixed lymphocytic and histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> occasionally possessed the receptors, irrespective of their immunological markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hodgkin's cells were negative on their surface, but were occasionally positive in their cytoplasms ans seen in case of histiocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From these results, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi> receptors could be neither T-cell nor B-cell differentiation marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The possibility that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>-receptor-negative lymphocytes may hav a quick turn-over rate or a <z:mp ids='MP_0002083'>short life span</z:mp> is also discussed </plain></SENT>
