<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on two cases of low grade follicle centre cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with a pronounced parafollicular monocytoid/ marginal zone B-cell component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One patient had a history of preceeding follicular high grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> type showing the same light chain restriction and identical immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement as the low grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosed 15 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Morphologically, in both cases the two constituents of the low grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were clearly distinguishable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, the follicular component strongly expressed bcl-2 protein in contrast to a weak staining of the marginal zone B-cell component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Performing PCR, a rearrangement of the major breakpoint region of bcl-2 was not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Identical light chain restriction of the follicular and the monocytoid B-cell/marginal zone components strongly indicates a clonal relationship between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A monocytoid/marginal zone B-cell component in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> probably results from differentiation of the follicle centre cells and does not indicate a composite <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
