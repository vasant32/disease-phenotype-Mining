<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several studies have suggested an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> among workers exposed to meat, without conclusive evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a multicenter case-control study during 1998-2004 in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Spain, including 2,007 cases of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 339 cases of Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 2,462 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We collected detailed information on occupational history and assessed exposure to meat in general and several types of meat via expert assessment of the questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio (OR) of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> for ever occupational exposure to meat was 1.18 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95-1.46), that for exposure to beef meat was 1.22 (95% CI 0.90-1.67), and that for exposure to chicken meat was 1.19 (95% CI 0.91-1.55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ORs were higher among workers with longer duration of exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An increased risk among workers exposed to beef meat was mainly apparent for diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR 1.49, 95%CI 0.96-2.33), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.78-2.34) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (OR 1.40, 95%CI 0.67-2.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latter 2 types were also associated with exposure to chicken meat (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.01-2.37, and OR 2.05, 95%CI 1.14-3.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, as well as Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> did not show any increase in risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Occupational exposure to meat does not appear to represent an important risk factor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, although an increased risk of specific types of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
