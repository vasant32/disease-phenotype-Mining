<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) achieve response after treatment but complete remission (CR) rates are very low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus the majority of them will relapse, mainly those in advanced stage disease, due to the persistence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study had the following aims: to determine the presence of bcl-2/IgH rearrangement in peripheral blood of early and advanced stage FL patients after treatment and to correlate it with their clinical situation at the same moment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We obtained 100 consecutive peripheral blood samples from 30 FL cases and conducted molecular studies using two separate semi-nested PCRs for MBR and mcr rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These semi-nested PCRs for bcl-2/IgH rearrangement were able to detect one positive cell among 10,000 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical and molecular evolution of patients diagnosed as early stage disease suggested that molecular response could be obtained even with conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this group of patients, 64% achieved molecular response in some point during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, only 23% of patients diagnosed as advanced stage disease reached molecular response when treated with chemotherapy (with or without radiotherapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Due to the low number of subjects assessed in this study, we only found a tendency to significance when clinical stage at the diagnosis was associated to molecular response (P = 0.095) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We observed 100% of concordance between clinical remission and molecular response in patients after bone marrow transplantation or in those cases treated with monoclonal antibody anti-CD20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study, performed in a restricted number of patients, suggests that molecular response can be obtained in FL patients diagnosed at early stage disease, even with conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In advanced stage disease, concordance between clinical remission and molecular response was observed in the majority of patients after bone marrow transplantation or in those cases treated with monoclonal antibody anti-CD20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The prognostic significance of this data should be confirmed with extended follow-up and in a larger number of patients </plain></SENT>
