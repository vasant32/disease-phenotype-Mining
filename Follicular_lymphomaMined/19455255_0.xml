<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clinical covariates such as age, gender, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade, and smoking history have been extensively used in prediction of disease occurrence and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, genomic biomarkers selected from microarray measurements may provide an alternative, satisfactory way of disease prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies show that better prediction can be achieved by using both clinical and genomic biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, due to different characteristics of clinical and genomic measurements, combining those covariates in disease prediction is very challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We propose a new regularization method, Covariate-Adjusted Threshold Gradient Directed Regularization (Cov-TGDR), for combining different type of covariates in disease prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proposed approach is capable of simultaneous biomarker selection and predictive model building </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It allows different degrees of regularization for different type of covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We consider biomedical studies with binary outcomes and right censored survival outcomes as examples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Logistic model and Cox model are assumed, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>Breast Cancer</z:hpo> data and the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> data show that the proposed approach can have better prediction performance than using clinical or genomic covariates alone </plain></SENT>
