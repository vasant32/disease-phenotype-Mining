<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present the case of a 66-year-old man with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e>) during a third infusion of rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002789'>tachypnea</z:hpo>, and progressive hypoxemia accompanied by massive bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusions</z:hpo> appeared suddenly approximately 3 hours after the third infusion was started, although the 2 prior infusions of rituximab had produced only mild adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated successfully with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> and 3 days of mechanical ventilatory support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No evidence was obtained to indicate that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> had been caused by either cytokine release or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> lysis, and serum human antichimeric antibody was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> was not confirmed, our experience in this case suggested that an anaphylactic reaction induced by repeated infusion of rituximab was involved in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> is rarely seen with rituximab infusion, careful management is required for safe administration of the newly developed rituximab therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This management includes monitoring biological reactions not only during the initial infusion but also during subsequent infusions of the antibody </plain></SENT>
