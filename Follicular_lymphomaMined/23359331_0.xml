<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This case describes an anti-HBc negative, DNA positive occult HBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in a 71-year-old Caucasian male following rituximab-based treatment for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pre-screening serology indicated negative HBsAg and anti-HBc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, following sequential treatment cycles the patient developed weak HBsAg with a low HBV DNA load (&lt;1,000 IU/ml), but remained anti-HBc negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The DNA load peaked 5 months later (&gt;1 × 10(6)  IU/ml) and he was subsequently treated with Tenofovir </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Currently the patient remains anti-HBc negative, and is anti-HBe negative, anti-HBs negative, HBeAg positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No clinical or biochemical evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> has occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis identified the HBV genosubtype as D4, most probably acquired some years ago during a stay in Papua New Guinea, in spite of prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B vaccination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four amino acid substitutions were detected within the HBsAg loop yet none in the core protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This case questions the dependability of anti-HBc testing and highlights the role of HBV DNA testing prior to and throughout cytotoxic or immunosuppressive regimes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As this case exemplifies, vaccination protects against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0275521" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">clinical infection</z:e> but may not exclude seronegative occult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with the possibility of reactivation </plain></SENT>
