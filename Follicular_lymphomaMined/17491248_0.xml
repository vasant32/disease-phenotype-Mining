<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: t(14;18) was tested in 115 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients by methods: FISH, nested and multiplex PCR of blood, bone marrow and lymph node specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the patients with rearrangement MBR quantitatively by real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Testing intervals of t(14;18) in peripheral blood were 1 month during treatment, 2-3 months during the first year after the end of treatment, then every 4 to 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were clinically examined in the same intervals and regular restaging was done by CT/PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each patient was evaluatee separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total detection of t(14;18) was 97% regardless tissue and methods of detection, FISH was superior to PCR (95% vs. 72%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The higher number of copies were observed in lymph nodes in comparison to bone marrow (p = 0.036) and peripheral blood (p = 0.016); 46/115 (40%) patients were positive for MBR, we followed up behaviour of t(14;18) in peripheral blood in 33 of them in long intervals (&gt;6 months, med </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>33 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Molecular and clinical courses correlated in 20/33 (61%) patients, 7/33 (21%) clinically relapsed in lasting molecular remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found very short interval to clinical relaps in 7 cases of molecular relapses (0-5 months, median 3 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We could not define "threshold quantity" of clinically important molecular relaps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lasting molecular remission was associated with clinical in about 60% cases; lasting molecular activity corresponded with clinical relaps in 86% patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: t(14;18) is highly associated with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In practice, monitoring of t(14;18) is feasible only in part of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Even if there is some correlation of clinical and molecular course, monitoring of t(14;18) in blood bears only limited prognostic value for the concrete patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The treatment of patient can not be accomplished on the basis of these results only </plain></SENT>
