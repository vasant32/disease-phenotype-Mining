<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed the targeting of the somatic hypermutation (SHM) mechanism at specific hotspot sequence motifs in the V(H) and Vkappa genes of 10 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) cases and the Vkappa and Vlambda genes of 11 kappa- and six lamda-light chain expressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These sequences were analyzed for targeting of specific motifs, ie certain highly mutable trinucleotides (3-NTPs), the tetranucleotide (4-NTP) RGYW and its complementary, WRCY (where R = <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi>, Y = <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi> and W = A or T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were carried out between mutation frequencies in RGYW vs WRCY and the incidence of mutations in complementarity determining region (CDR)-1 vs CDR2 vs CDR3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant differences were obtained when comparing: (1) the ratio of mutations in 4-NTPs (RGYW, WRCY, RGYW+WRCY)/mutations in the whole V sequence in MM-Vkappa vs MM-Vlamda; (2) the total number of mutated 4-NTPs in MM-Vkappa vs FL-Vkappa; (3) the number of mutated RGYW 4-NTPs in MM-Vkappa vs FL-Vkappa and FL-V(H) vs FL-Vkappa; (4) the number of mutated WRCY 4-NTPs in MM-Vkappa vs FL-Vkappa (P= 0.006) and FL-V(H) vs FL-Vkappa; (5) the targeting of RGYW vs WRCY in the CDRs of FL-V(H) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar results (regarding statistical significance) were obtained when undertaking intergroup comparisons for 3-NTPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings conform well with relevant data derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The differences observed in favor of 4-NTP (RGYW and WRCY) targeting in FL-V(H) vs FL-Vkappa and MM-Vkappa vs FL-Vkappa may implicate differences in the evolution of SHM coupled with selection in different stages of B cell ontogeny </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several explanations can be offered for the fact that hotspot sequences were not always targeted by SHM in FL and MM: (1) other unrecognized motifs may be targets of SHM; (2) 'inappropriately' introduced mutations were fixed and propagated by the neoplastic process; (3) certain FL and MM cases might have lost their ability to correct mutations introduced in classic hotspots due to deficient mismatch-repair (MMR) mechanisms; conversely, in other cases with intact MMR function, the hotspot to non-hotspot targeting of somatic hypermutation is balanced </plain></SENT>
