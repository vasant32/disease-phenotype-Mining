<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some low-grade FLs are aggressively transformed into diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, presumably by acquisition of secondary chromosomal changes, including chromosomal band 1p36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A common example is add(1)(p36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because it is difficult to identify the origin of add(1)(p36) even on high-resolution G-banding analysis, we used spectral karyotyping (SKY) and double-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (DC-FISH) to define the t(14;18) and the extra band at 1p36 in two cases of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SKY revealed that the extra chromosomal segment on 1p36 was derived from chromosome 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DC-FISH defined BCL2/IgH fusion signals at 1p36 in addition to t(14;18), suggesting that BCL2/IgH fusion at 1p36 was an evolutionary alteration following the primary BCL2/IgH translocation on der(18) in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that IgH alleles, implicated in chromosomal rearrangement, may themselves frequently be targets for secondary translocations, suggesting that multiple IgH translocations and insertions are associated with the progression of FL </plain></SENT>
