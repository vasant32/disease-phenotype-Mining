<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight hundred and fifty four consecutive lymphadenectomies received between 1988 and 2001 were reviewed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incidental pathology was found in 15 cases: florid sinus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_146,MPATH_652'>histiocytosis</z:mpath> following prosthetic joint replacement (eight), non-caseating granulomas (three), small lymphocytic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (two), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (one), and foreign body reaction (one) </plain></SENT>
