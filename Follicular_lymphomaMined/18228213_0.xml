<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ibritumomab is an (90)<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">Yttrium</z:chebi> ((90)Y) labelled radioimmunoconjugate registered to treat follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> relapsing or refractory after Rituximab therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Combining the specificity of anti CD20 monoclonal antibodies with the efficacy of radiotherapy, it is particularly effective in patients with advanced stages of disease with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008940'>generalized lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, after failing 2-5 lines of previous treatment, were subjected to radioimmunotherapy in three Polish <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Research Group (PLRG) centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ibritumomab infusion was followed by 2 doses of Rituximab (250 mg/m(2) at day -7 and 0) to enhance its biodistribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Radioimmunoconjugate was prepared in the Nuclear Medicine Departments of participating centres based on patient weight and full blood count results (14.8 MBq/kg, max 1200 MBq, reduced to 11.1 MBq/kg in cases with blood platelet 100,000-150,000 or leukocytes 1500-2000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>14.8 MBq/kg (0.4 mCi/kg) 100 thousand to 149 thousand/mm(3) platelets 11.1 MBq/kg (0.3 mCi/kg) RESULTS: The primary endpoint of the study was the assessment of response rate and haematological toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Objective responses were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, with 10 partial and 12 complete regressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytopenia, starting 3-4 weeks after radioimmunotherapy, reflected haematological toxicity - the only important side effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was more pronounced, with platelet counts of &lt; 50,000/ul in every second patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> 21 months after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After the medium time of follow up over 2 years, 2 patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median progression free survival (secondary study endpoint) was 15 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ibritumomab radioimmunotherapy is an efficient method of palliation treatment of heavily pre-treated follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, failing numerous previous treatment lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Earlier application increases the number of complete responses and prolongs progression free survival </plain></SENT>
