<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the morphological, immunophenotypical, and clinical features of 53 cases of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> involving the breast in a population of Brazilian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of the cases were of B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four of the patients with primary breast <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 3 had CD30-positive anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and 1 had <z:mp ids='MP_0011164'>panniculitis</z:mp>-like T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most patients presented with an incidental breast mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary breast <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was seen in 19 patients and most commonly occurred as part of widespread nodal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients presented with bilateral breast involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most prevalent histological subtype was also diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, followed by follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study shows that the broad morphological and immunophenotypical spectrum of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the breast occurring in a large series of Brazilian patients has many similarities with that seen in Western countries, with a higher proportion of high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in both primary and secondary cases </plain></SENT>
