<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, innovative strategies were still needed to treat patients with chemorefractory disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore subsequently performed a trial in which (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (0.4 mCi/kg) was added to the fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> conditioning regimen ((90)YFC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we report updated results of the FCR trial and outcomes after (90)YFC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the FCR group (N = 47), since the last update, one patient developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 107 months (range, 72-142 months), the 11-year overall survival and progression-free survival rates were 78%, and 72%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the (90)YFC group (N = 26), more patients had chemorefractory disease than did those in the FCR group (38% and 0%, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 33 months (range,17-94 months), the 3-year progression-free survival rates for patients with chemorefractory and chemosensitive disease were 80% and 87%, respectively (P = .7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The low frequency of relapse observed after a long follow-up interval of 9 years in the FCR group suggests that these patients are cured of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The addition of (90)Y to the conditioning regimen appears to be effective in patients with chemorefractory disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00048737 </plain></SENT>
