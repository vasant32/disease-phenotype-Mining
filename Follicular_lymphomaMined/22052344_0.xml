<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified the same bcl-2/IgH fusion gene in paraffin-embedded lymph node (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>) samples and BM samples using immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunocytochemistry (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e>), cytologic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of the Bcl-2/IgH fusion gene in the BM samples and paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> samples from 56 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was detected using FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Bcl-2 protein levels in BM and paraffin-embedded tissues were quantified using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> and IHC, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Approximately 78.6% (44/56) of the paraffinâ€‘embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> tissue sections that underwent FISH analysis had a bcl-2/IgH translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1402294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary lesion</z:e> was also positive for the bcl-2/IgH fusion gene, as were the BM minimal infiltrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2/IgH rearrangement occurred in 88.6% (39/44) of the BM specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2/IgH recombination rate in stage III/IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> was significantly different to that observed in stage I/II <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (p=0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 59% (23/39) of the cases with t(14;18), Bcl-2 was found to be present as assessed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Positive Bcl-2 ICC staining and the t(14;18) translocation (as detected using FISH) were positively correlated (p=0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We then applied the FISH method to slides that had previously been morphologically evaluated using Wright-Giemsa staining; any slides with at least one abnormal cell were subjected to FISH analysis following staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The assessment of bcl-2/IgH translocation status may contribute to the better detection of minimal BM infiltration by FL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Utilizing FISH and cytologic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> techniques allows for earlier and more accessible BM examination </plain></SENT>
