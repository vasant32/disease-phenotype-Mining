<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between October 2009 and December 2011, 14 hematologic patients with known spleen involvement were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An additional 17 consecutive patients without known splenic or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> were enrolled as controls, as well as 29 patients with liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001409'>portal hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 40-second volume perfusion computed tomographic scan of the upper abdomen was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis included measurement of splenic volume, blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), K(trans), and mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, mean splenic volume and perfusion parameters were as follows: splenic volume, 1125.34 mL; BF, 61.24 mL/100 mL/min; BV, 16.53 mL/100 mL; K(trans), 37.00 mL/100 mL/min; and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>, 12.42 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> perfusion values of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> differed significantly, except for BV, compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, significant correlations were found between splenic volume and BF (r = -0.683, P = .000), splenic volume and BV (r = -0.525, P = .002), and splenic volume and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> (r = 0.543, P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During treatment, significant correlations between the diameters of nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> target lesions, splenic volume, and the perfusion parameters were present for splenic volume (r = 0.601, P = .002), BF (r = -0.777, P = .000) and BV (r = -0.500, P = .011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Volume perfusion computed tomography represents a novel tool for the assessment of splenic perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Preliminary results in patients with spleen involvement reveal lower perfusion values compared to controls or patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this technique might provide additional information in clinical routine </plain></SENT>
