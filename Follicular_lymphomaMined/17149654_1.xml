<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neighboring and regional countries varied in their frequency reporting like in Israel (22 of 36 cases; 61%), Turkey (46 of 67 cases; 68.7%), and Jordan (4 of 5 cases; 80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first study conducted in Lebanon to determine the frequency of this translocation in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 42 cases diagnosed with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at the American University of Beirut Medical Center, amplifiable DNA was extracted from the corresponding paraffin embedded tissues and tested for t(14; 18) translocation using PCR amplification of the MBR and MCR breakpoints (INVIVOSCRIBE, CA, USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that 19 patients were positive for t(14; 18) (45.2%) while 23 were negative (54.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 19 positive cases, bcl2 was positive in 10 cases (52.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of the cases were positive for MBR (40.47%), while only two cases were positive for MCR (4.76%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study expands the geographical map of the distribution of bcl-2 gene rearrangement in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients in the Middle East region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The interesting low frequency of t(14;18) in Lebanese follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients (45.2%) stands out among several other increased frequencies in surrounding and regional countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, in this patient population, there is a decreased frequency of the MBR breakpoint (40.47%) while that reported in the literature ranges from 50 to 60% </plain></SENT>
