<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients were selected because of a specific PCR-amplifiable t(14;18) mbr translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PCR amplification of rearrangements of the complementary region III (CDRIII) of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene was also carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After autologous stem cell transplantation, patients were prospectively monitored with both molecular genetic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven of the 15 patients with detectable t(14;18) prior to transplantation were persistently negative during follow-up to 32 months post transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of these patients relapsed, whereas four of eight patients with positive PCR signals post transplant relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparing t(14;18) and PAGE results, we observed six patients showing clonal signals in CDRIII PAGE in spite of persistent negativity of t(14;18) PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We concluded that in patients with FL, t(14;18) PCR is superior to CDRIII PCR in terms of sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A positive t(14;18) PCR during the first year post transplant is highly predictive for disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CDRIII PCR may be used for monitoring in t(14;18) negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, due to the poor specificity of conventional gel electrophoresis PCR, the use of clone-specific probes is highly desirable </plain></SENT>
