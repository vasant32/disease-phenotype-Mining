<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is considered incurable, although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHOP) chemotherapy can induce sequential remissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A patient's second complete response is typically shorter than that patient's first complete response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Idiotype vaccines can elicit specific immune responses and molecular remissions in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, a clinical benefit has never been formally proven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-three consecutive follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients in first relapse received six monthly cycles of CHOP-like chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who achieved a second complete response were vaccinated periodically for more than 2 years with autologous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived idiotype protein vaccine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specific humoral and cellular responses were assessed, and patients were followed for disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical tests were two-sided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Idiotype vaccine could be produced for 25 patients who had a second complete response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 20 patients (80%), a humoral (13/20) and/or a cellular (18/20) idiotype-specific response was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median duration of the second complete response has not been reached, but it exceeds 33 months (range = 20+ to 51+ months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the 20 responders relapsed while undergoing active vaccination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> responders with enough follow-up for the comparison to be made experienced a second complete response that was statistically significantly (P&lt;.0001) longer than both their first complete response (18 of 18 patients) and than the median duration of a CHOP-induced second complete response, i.e., 13 months (20 of 20 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The five nonresponders <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had a second complete response that was shorter (median = 10 months; range = 8-13 months) than their first complete response (median = 17 months; range = 10-39 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Idiotypic vaccination induced a specific immune response in the majority of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Specific immune response was associated with a dramatic and highly statistically significant increase in disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This is the first formal demonstration of clinical benefit associated with the use of a human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> vaccine </plain></SENT>
