<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluate the detection of an abnormal reactive serological pattern to EBV (ab_EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in a multicentric case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum samples were collected at study entry from 1,085 incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases from Spain, France, Germany, Czech Republic, Italy and 1,153 age, sex and country matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EBV immunoglobulin G (IgG) serostatus was evaluated through a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-based ELISA combining immunodominant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> of EBNA1 (BKRF1) and VCA-p18 (BFRF3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, immunoblot analysis was performed to evaluate distinct antibody diversity patterns to EBV early antigens (EA), besides EBNA1, VCA-p18, VCA-p40 (BdRF1) and Zebra (BZLF1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> and aberrant EBV activity were characterized as having an abnormal reactive pattern (ab_EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ab_EBV was observed in 20.9% of 2,238 included subjects with an increased proportion of cases presenting ab_EBV as compared to the control population (23.9% vs. 18.0% p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ab_EBV positivity was a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> combined (odds ratio [OR] = 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.15-1.74), and specifically for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (OR = 2.96, 95%CI = 2.22-3.95) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EBV may be involved in a larger subset of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> among clinically immunocompetent subjects than previously thought, probably explained by an underlying loss of immune control of EBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ab_EBV is a useful tool to explore EBV imbalances preceding or paralleling possible EBV associated oncogenic events </plain></SENT>
