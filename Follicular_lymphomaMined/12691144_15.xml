<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of this feature is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze the bcl-2/IgH rearrangement by means of a PCR technique, and to correlate molecular findings with clinical characteristics and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine patients (median age, 53 years; male/female ratio: 35/34) diagnosed with FL in a single institution were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 77 DNA samples were analyzed, 54 were obtained from lymph node biopsy and 23 from peripheral blood or bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2/IgH rearrangement was assessed for both the major breakpoint region (MBR) and the minor cluster region (mcr) breakpoints by a PCR technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine out of sixty patients (65%) with assessable samples were found to have a bcl-2/IgH rearrangement in the MBR breakpoint, whereas bcl-2/IgH rearrangement in mcr was observed in one patient (2%) and no rearrangement at MBR or mcr in the remaining 20 patients (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regarding the initial characteristics, patients with bcl-2/IgH rearrangements at MBR or mcr were younger (&lt;65 years) than those with no rearrangement at these sites (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No differences were found according to bcl-2/IgH rearrangement in terms of complete response rate, time to treatment failure and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In our series bcl-2/IgH rearrangement at MBR or mcr, which was found in 67% of the patients, was not correlated with response to treatment, survival nor time-to-treatment-failure </plain></SENT>
