<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical course of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although it is a chemosensitive disease, thereby allowing substantial palliation, recurrence is the rule; only a small subset who presents with limited stage disease is cured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple attempts have been made over the past two decades to improve the survival of patients with FL, and a large number of phase III trials have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These have included a variety of different therapeutic interventions, such as combination chemotherapy, recombinant interferons, new cytotoxic drugs, and immunologic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most studies have not demonstrated that the use of a particular therapy convincingly prolongs survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells express CD20 and are associated in most cases with the t(14:18) chromosomal translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against the B-cell CD20 antigen, which has been utilized for the therapy of B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rituximab was shown to be active in FL, and studies of its effectiveness in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy to increase the response rate are forthcoming </plain></SENT>
