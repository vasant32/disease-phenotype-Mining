<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The genetics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> susceptibility reflect the marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of diseases that comprise this broad phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, multiple subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are observed in some families, suggesting shared pathways of genetic predisposition to these pathologically distinct entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a two-stage GWAS, we tested 530,583 SNPs in 944 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, including 282 familial cases, and 4,044 public shared controls, followed by genotyping of 50 SNPs in 1,245 cases and 2,596 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A novel region on 11q12.1 showed association with combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (LYM) subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SNPs in this region included rs12289961 near LPXN, (P(LYM) = 3.89×10(-8), OR = 1.29) and rs948562 (P(LYM) = 5.85×10(-7), OR = 1.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A SNP in a novel non-HLA region on 6p23 (rs707824, P(NHL) = 5.72×10(-7)) was suggestive of an association conferring susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four SNPs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in a previously reported HLA region, 6p21.32, showed genome-wide significant associations with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most significant association with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was for rs4530903 (P(FL) = 2.69×10(-12), OR = 1.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three novel SNPs near the HLA locus, rs9268853, rs2647046, and rs2621416, demonstrated additional variation contributing toward genetic susceptibility to FL associated with this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Genes implicated by GWAS were also found to be cis-eQTLs in lymphoblastoid cell lines; candidate genes in these regions have been implicated in hematopoiesis and immune function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results, showing novel susceptibility regions and allelic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, point to the existence of pathways of susceptibility to both shared as well as specific subtypes of lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
