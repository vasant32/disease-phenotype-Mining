<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical records of 16 consecutive patients with ocular adnexal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> for whom pretreatment and posttreatment PET scans and corresponding computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were available were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pretreatment PET scans demonstrated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49134">fluorine 18-fluorodeoxyglucose</z:chebi> (FDG) positive lesions in 15 orbits of 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient with low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the orbit, PET revealed an additional focus of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the deltoid muscle that was missed on clinical examination and conventional radiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the posttreatment PET scans showed complete resolution of FDG uptake, suggesting good response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, posttreatment CT and MRI scans demonstrated residual masses in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PET is valuable for initial staging of ocular adnexal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and may be a good adjunct to conventional imaging in evaluation of response to therapy </plain></SENT>
