<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Materials and methods: We retrospectively analyzed data from 59 relapsed or refractory FL patients treated with ibritumomab tiuxetan Y 90 in four different PET centers who had a PET scan carried out before and after RIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Possible predictive factors of progression-free survival (PFS) were studied through univariate and multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The post-RIT PET documented 45.8% complete responders (CR), 25.4% partial responders (PR) and 28.8% nonresponders [stable disease + progressive disease], with an overall survival of 71.2% (range 59.5%-90.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up period of 23 months, the univariate analysis documented a statistically significant relation between disease extent before RIT and response to treatment with respect to PFS (P = 0.015), while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the other prognostic factors showed no significant correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When carrying out the multivariate analysis, post-RIT PET resulted as the lonely independent predictor of PFS (P &lt; 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RIT is an effective therapy in FL patients, as confirmed in our study too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disease extension before treatment and response to RIT, as assessed by FDG-PET, result as main predictors of PFS, with the post-RIT PET result being the only independent predictive factor </plain></SENT>
