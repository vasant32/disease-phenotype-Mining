<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Lymph node or bone marrow biopsy from sixty-one patients affected by aggressive non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) were retrospectively evaluated to assess the histology at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighteen cases (29.5%) were proven to have relapsed or persistent low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> after conventional therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 5/18 patients association of low and high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was detectable at diagnosis by bone marrow biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 13/18 no evidence of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was detected at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The outcome of these patients was compared to that of 43 patients relapsed without change in histology and treated by a second line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these 43 patients, 13 were not responders (NR), 10 achieved a partial remission (PR) and 18 complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two were lost during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 18 patients with residual/relapsed indolent subtype received oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (100 mg/day for 15 days every month for six months): 3 of them had NR, 5 CR, and 10 PR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall survival (OS) median time was 39 months in low-grade resistant/relapsed patients and 20 months in patients with aggressive histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>OS at 24 months was 71 and 41%, respectively, (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients with high-grade disease were refractory or relapsed after a median of five months, whereas cases with low-grade NHL showed a long lasting stable PR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the higher grade patients with residual or relapsed low grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were, in fact, transformed low-grade at diagnosis and, after removing the more aggressive component by chemotherapy, it is possible to manage these patients by conventional therapy for indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
