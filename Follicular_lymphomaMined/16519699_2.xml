<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic studies have revealed a broad spectrum of clonal genetic abnormalities and complex karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to contribute to the understanding of the genomic alterations associated with this group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cytogenetic, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and molecular analyses were performed in 30 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>: 20 de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (dn-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and 10 DLBCL secondary to follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 37 different structural chromosomal rearrangements were found: 27% translocations, 54% deletions, and 19% other alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromosomes 8, 6, 2, and 9 were the most commonly affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, translocation t(3;14)(q27;q32) and/or BCL-6 gene rearrangements were not observed either by cytogenetic studies or by FISH analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen novel cytogenetic alterations were detected, among them translocations t(2;21)(p11;q22) and t(8;18)(q24;p11.3) appeared as sole structural abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21) and/or BCL-2-IGH gene rearrangements were the genomic alterations most frequently observed: 50% of S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and 30% of dn-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Deletions del(4)(q21), del(6)(q27), del(8)(q11), and del(9)(q11) were recurrent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common gains involved chromosome regions at 12q13-q24, 7q10-q32, and 17q22-qter; 6q was the most frequently deleted region, followed by losses at 2q35-qter, 7q32-qter, and 9q13-qter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four novel regions of loss were identified: 5q13-q21, 2q35-qter (both recurrent in our series), 4p11-p12, and 17q11-q12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These studies emphasize the value of combining conventional cytogenetics with FISH and molecular studies to allow a more accurate definition of the genomic aberrations involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
