<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical behavior and treatment outcome of ocular adnexal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> classified by the World Health Organization system, with emphasis on marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinicopathologic materials from 98 consecutive patients treated for ocular adnexal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 84 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> (75% Stage I, 6% Stage III, and 19% Stage IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Radiation (<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photons</z:chebi>/electrons) was administered to 102 eyes to a median dose of 30.6 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 82 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most common subtypes among the primary patients were MALT (57%) and follicular (18%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-year actuarial local control rate in 102 irradiated eyes was 98% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the 5-year local control rate correlated with the radiation dose in the MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subgroup (n = 53): 81% for &lt;30 Gy and 100% for &gt; or =30 Gy (p &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the non-MALT low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> such as follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 30), the local control rate was 100% regardless of dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For 39 Stage I MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients treated with radiation alone, the distant relapse-free survival rate was 75% at 5 years and 45% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Distant relapses were generally isolated and successfully salvaged by local therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall survival for this subgroup was 81% at 10 years, with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dose-response data suggest that the optimal radiation dose for MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the ocular adnexa is 30.6-32.4 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is adequately controlled with doses in the mid-20 Gy range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The substantial risk of distant relapse in Stage I ocular adnexal MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> underscores the importance of long-term follow-up for this disease and the need for additional comparative studies of MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of different anatomic sites </plain></SENT>
