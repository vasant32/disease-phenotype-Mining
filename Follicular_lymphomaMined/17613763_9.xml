<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The BIOMED-2 PCR-based immunoglobulin gene rearrangement assays have quickly become the most commonly used laboratory method for detection of B-cell clonality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the reliability of these assays under various conditions has become increasingly important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When studying paired cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) from individual patients, we used these assays to assess clonality in 40 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens from 19 patients diagnosed with FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The assays of IGH rearrangement failed to give a clonal result in 26/40 (65%) specimens, while the IGK assays failed in only 3/40 (8%) specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The high failure rate of the IGH assays for this set of FFPE <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> cannot be explained by systematic problems with DNA extraction or amplification because the same IGH assays resulted in a low failure rate (3/32, 9%) for FFPE small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> specimens and for fresh frozen FL specimens (1/6, 17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in a second validation set of 13 FFPE follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> the failure rate was 9/13 (69%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the BIOMED-2 IGH assay did not perform well on FFPE follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> specimens, and the IGK assay may be superior for assessing clonality when no fresh/frozen tissue is available </plain></SENT>
