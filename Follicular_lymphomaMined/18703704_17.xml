<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We applied genome-wide BAC array comparative genomic hybridization to 106 diagnostic biopsies of FL to characterize regional genomic imbalances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using an analytical approach that defined regions of copy number change as intersections between visual annotations and a Hidden Markov model-based algorithm, we identified 71 regional alterations that were recurrent in at least 10% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These ranged in size from approximately 200 kb to 44 Mb, affecting chromosomes 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17, 18, 19, and 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated by cluster analysis that 46.2% of the 106 cases could be sub-grouped based on the presence of +1q, +6p/6q-, +7, or +18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis showed that 21 of the 71 regions correlated significantly with inferior overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these 21 regions, 16 were independent predictors of OS using a multivariate Cox model that included the international prognostic index (IPI) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two of these 16 regions (1p36.22-p36.33 and 6q21-q24.3) were also predictors of transformation risk and independent of IPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These prognostic features may be useful to identify high-risk patients as candidates for risk-adapted therapies </plain></SENT>
