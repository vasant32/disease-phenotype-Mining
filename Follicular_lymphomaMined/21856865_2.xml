<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yet, the link between CTL tissue distribution, activation status, ability to kill FL cells in vivo, and disease progression is still elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment lymph nodes from FL patients were analyzed by IHC (n = 80) or by 3-color confocal microscopy (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IHC revealed a rich infiltrate of CD8+ granzyme B+ (GrzB) cells in FL interfollicular spaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, confocal microscopy showed an increased number of CD3+CD8+GrzB+ CTLs and a brighter GrzB staining in individual CTL in FL samples compared with reactive lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CTLs did not penetrate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> nodules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 3-dimensional (3-D) image reconstructions, CTLs were detected at the FL follicle border where they formed lytic synapse-like structures with FL B cells and with apoptotic cells, suggesting an in situ cytotoxic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, although GrzB expression in CTLs did not correlate with risk factors, high GrzB content correlated with prolonged progression free-survival (PFS) after rituximab-combined chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results show the recruitment of armed CTLs with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-controlling potential into FL lymph nodes and suggest that CTL-associated GrzB expression could influence PFS in FL patients having received rituximab-combined chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
