<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21) occurs in 70% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and places the BCL2 proto-oncogene, normally located at 18q21, under the control of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene at 14q32 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its detection by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), made possible by the close clustering of most of the BCL2 breakpoints in the major breakpoint region (MBR) of the gene, has numerous clinical applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the PCR covers shorter lengths of DNA than Southern blotting, PCR-based tests may be more susceptible to microheterogeneity in breakpoint location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There have been no published studies of the impact of breakpoint microheterogeneity on the detection rate of this translocation by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied 30 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with the t(14;18), in which a BCL2 MBR rearrangement had previously been demonstrated and mapped by conventional Southern blotting, by PCR with the commonly used IgH and BCL2 MBR primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five cases (83%) had a junction fragment demonstrable by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three cases in which the MBR rearrangement mapped outside of the 4.3-kb HindIII fragment containing the MBR, as determined by Southern blotting, were negative by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, two cases with rearrangements within the HindIII fragment were also negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> negative results were repeated at least once and were confirmed to be true negatives by actin PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that negative PCR results in this setting are attributable to small variations in BCL2 MBR breakpoint location and cannot be interpreted without the corresponding conventional Southern blotting data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With this caveat in mind, PCR analysis for the t(14;18) remains an extremely useful technique, especially in the follow-up and monitoring for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> in previously characterized cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
