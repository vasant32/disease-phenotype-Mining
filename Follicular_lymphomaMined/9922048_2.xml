<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, only a few reports have been published in Latin American countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this work, the clinical and pathologic findings of 264 patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in Mexico City were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large (14%) and diffuse mixed cell types (20%) predominated among nodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within the group of patients with high grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo> were the most common (40/48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is important to mention that follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> (4.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> the most commonly involved site was the gastrointestinal tract (11.3%), followed by the midline (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis of 65 cases with immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene probes showed that most <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were of B-cell lineage (66%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining group was composed of T-cell (25%) and bigenotypic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> attempts to establish a correlation between the clinical stage and histopathological types with the genetic findings were not successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, pre-B and bigenotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were observed mainly in patients over 60 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study highlights some relevant characteristics of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in Mexico </plain></SENT>
