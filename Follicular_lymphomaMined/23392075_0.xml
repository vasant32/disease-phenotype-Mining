<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, we evaluated the risk factors associated with venous irritation induced by bendamustine in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the effectiveness of intervention of changing the preparation procedure for bendamustine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> data were retrospectively collected from the electronic medical record system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the initial analysis of the total 43 courses of bendamustine therapy, most patients (88%) were administered bendamustine with 250 mL of diluent according to the bendamustine package insert in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median concentration of bendamustine solution (0.56 mg/mL vs. 0.24 mg/mL) and the incidences of venous irritation (66% vs. 0%, p=0.01) were significantly different between the patients receiving bendamustine at 250 mL and 500 mL of diluent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on this result, we proposed changing the final volume of bendamustine dissolution from 250 to 500 mL, which is recommended in other countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After this intervention, the incidence of venous irritation was significantly reduced from 58 to 20% (p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of venous irritation increased in a concentration-dependent manner (â‰¤0.40 mg/mL: 6%; 0.41-0.60 mg/mL: 62%, p&lt;0.001; &gt;0.60 mg/mL: 75%, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a high concentration bendamustine solution is a risk factor for venous irritation and that 500 mL of diluent is ideal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To further reduce the incidence of venous irritation, the concentration of bendamustine solution is recommended to be 0.40 mg/mL or less </plain></SENT>
