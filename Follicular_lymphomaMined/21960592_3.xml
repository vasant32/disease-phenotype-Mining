<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A total of 90% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs) harbor the translocation t(14;18) leading to deregulated BCL2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conversely, 10% of FLs lack the t(14;18), and the majority of these FLs do not express BCL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The molecular features of t(14;18)-negative FLs remain largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed microRNA expression analysis in 32 FL grades 1 to 3A, including 17 t(14;18)-positive FLs, 9 t(14;18)-negative FLs without BCL2 expression, and 6 t(14;18)-negative FLs with BCL2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MicroRNA profiles were correlated with corresponding <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression patterns, and potential targets were investigated by quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry in an independent validation series of 83 FLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis identified 17 microRNAs that were differentially expressed between t(14;18)-positive FLs and t(14;18)-negative FLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The down-regulation of miR-16, miR-26a, miR-101, miR-29c, and miR138 in the t(14;18)-negative FL subset was associated with profound <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression changes of potential target genes involving cell cycle control, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and B-cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>miR-16 target CHEK1 showed increased expression in t(14;18)-negative FLs, whereas TCL1A expression was reduced, in line with a partial loss of the germinal center B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> in this FL subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, t(14;18)-negative FL have distinct microRNA profiles that are associated with an increased proliferative capacity and a "late" germinal center B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
