<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the main dilemma at each relapse is the choice for the most effective treatment for optimal disease control and failure-free survival while at the same time avoiding overtreatment and harmful side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The selection for more aggressive treatment is currently based on histologic grading and clinical criteria; however, in up to 30% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases these methods prove to be insufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using supervised classification on a training set of paired samples from patients who experienced either an indolent or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> course, a gene expression profile of 81 genes was established that could, with an accuracy of 100%, distinguish low-grade from high-grade disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This profile accurately classified 93% of the FL samples in an independent validation set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most important, in a third series of FL cases where histologic grading was ambiguous, precluding meaningful morphologic guidance, the 81-gene profile shows a classification accuracy of 94% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The FL stratification profile is a more reliable marker of clinical behavior than the currently used histologic grading and clinical criteria and may provide an important alternative to guide the choice of therapy in patients with FL both at presentation and at relapse </plain></SENT>
