<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic potential of PCR-based studies on the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangements and the t(14;18) translocation was evaluated in a series of 30 benign and 46 malignant follicular lymphoid lesions including difficult problem cases using <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16842">formaldehyde</z:chebi>-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clonal IgH gene rearrangement was documented by PCR in 38/46 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> using two alternative (FR3A and FR2A-based) primer systems: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> benign <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasias</z:mpath> showed a polyclonal pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18) translocation was documented in 20/46 cases, including cases that did not show a clonal IgH gene amplification; a weak signal was seen in 6 benign <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasias</z:mpath> probably related to the recently described rare non-neoplastic cells carrying the t(14;18) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the translocations in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 18 involved the major breakpoint region (MBR) and two the minor cluster region (MCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> could be reached with at least one marker in over 90% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With these tests we diagnosed an incidental follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the axillary dissection for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo>, and confirmed benign nature of an extreme <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> with a 2200 g spleen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One diffuse large cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with subsequent follicular small cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was diagnosed to have a similar t(14;18) translocation showing a link between the two seemingly different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
