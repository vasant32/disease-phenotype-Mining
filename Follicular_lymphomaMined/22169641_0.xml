<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-eight cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were enrolled into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were graded according to the 2008 WHO criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of MUM-1/IRF4 protein and other markers (CD10, bcl-6, bcl-2 and Ki-67) was studied using tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Amongst the 98 cases studied, there were 24 grade 1 cases, 30 grade 2 cases, 26 grade 3A cases and 18 were grade 3B cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rates of expression of MUM-1/IRF4, CD10, bcl-6, bcl-2 and Ki-67 (â‰¥ 25%) were 39.8% (39/98), 62.2% (61/98), 80.6% (79/98), 87.8% (86/98) and 50.0% (49/98), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MUM-1/IRF4 predominantly expressed in high-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and showed a significantly positive correlation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade (r = 0.628, P = 0.000) and Ki-67 index (r = 0.473, P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MUM-1/IRF4 expression had a significantly negative correlation with CD10 expression (r = -0.597, P = 0.000), but no correlation with bcl-6 and bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MUM-1/IRF4 expression is significantly higher in high-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, indicating that these cases have a high proliferative activity, more <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behavior</z:hpo> and poorer prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MUM-1/IRF4, when strongly expressed, is another helpful marker for the diagnosis of high-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
