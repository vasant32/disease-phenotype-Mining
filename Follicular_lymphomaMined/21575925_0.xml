<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In advanced-stage indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, therapeutic approaches may vary from watch and wait, antibody monotherapy, immunochemotherapy, or dose-intensified consolidation up to allogeneic strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this nationwide survey, representative hematologic/oncologic centers monitored current treatment strategies in indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in general practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four hundred ninety-five centers involved in the treatment of indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> including university hospitals, community hospitals, and oncologists in practice were identified and contacted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirteen percent of centers provided information on 741 patients, which corresponds to 10% of the expected national prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Detailed data on 576 unselected patients from 46 representative centers (2 university hospitals, 25 community hospitals, and 19 oncologists in practice) for whom a treatment decision took place in the fourth quarter of 2006 (start, change, or end of therapy) were included in this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were verified by monitoring the pseudonymized patient documents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median age was 67 years (range, 17 to 95 years) and 65% of patients were 60 years of age or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concomitant disease was frequent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> (29%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (28%), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (11%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> (7%) being the most typical combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histologies included 39% follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 26% <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), 10% marginal zone, 9% mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>), and 16% other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 10% of the overall patient population were treated within these studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The aim of initial therapy was curative in 35%, and physicians aimed at improved survival in 62% and palliation only in 54% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Radiation (10%), antibody monotherapy (4%), chemotherapy (33%), and combined immunochemotherapy (31%) were the most frequent approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Applied chemotherapies included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHOP) (46%), fludarabine combinations (F/FC/FCM: 15%), <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> (14%), CVP/COP (9%) and bendamustin (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Maintenance was used in 12% and autologous/allogeneic stem cell consolidation were rarely applied (both in 3% of patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At first relapse, combined approaches including immunochemotherapy (49%), maintenance therapy (16%), and autologous/allogeneic transplantation (14%/4%) were more frequently administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>As expected, different treatment strategies and response rates were observed in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, and CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, supportive measures including antibiotics (34%), erythrocyte transfusions (32%), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (22%), immunoglobulines (19%), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35718">antifungal drugs</z:chebi> (13%), and erythropoetin (10%) were frequently applied even in first-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Overall response was 83% (FL: 97%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>: 95%, CLL: 74%) with a 39% complete response (FL 63%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> 54%, CLL 15%) rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: In this population-based survey, patients characteristics differed significantly from published study cohorts as did clinical strategies and therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Thus, clinically more relevant studies in medically compromised patients are urgently warranted </plain></SENT>
