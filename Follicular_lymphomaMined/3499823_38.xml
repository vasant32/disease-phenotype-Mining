<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Infiltrating lymphoid and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were characterized in frozen sections by the use of monoclonal antibodies and the avidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> complex (ABC) immunoperoxidase technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five patients had objective <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> (1 complete response of a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 4 partial responses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanomas</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four patients (2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanomas</z:hpo>, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo>) were nonresponsive after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After treatment, responsive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> showed a pronounced infiltration of T cells, mainly Leu-2+ (CD8, primarily cytotoxic/suppressor) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Macrophages, although increased, were fewer than the T cells, and Leu-7+ or Leu-11+ (NK and K) cells were virtually absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In nonresponders, there was no significant increase in lymphoid cells after therapy, and no differences were noted between groups before therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 4 of 5 responders, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were positive for HLA-DR before therapy; and in the remaining responder, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> became positive during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> biopsy specimens from nonresponders were DR- before and after the start of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the expression of HLA-DR by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells may play a role in the response to IL-2 with or without LAK and that marked infiltration by T cells accompanies, and possibly mediates, such a response </plain></SENT>
