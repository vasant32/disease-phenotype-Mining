<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Encouraging results have been reported in phase II trials after s.c. vaccination of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients during clinical remission with idiotype produced from eukaryotic cell lines and coupled to an immunogenic carrier <z:chebi fb="4" ids="33839">macromolecule</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have developed a good manufacturing protocol for rapid expression of idiotype vaccines as recombinant Fab fragments in Escherichia coli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this trial were to show safety and feasibility of intradermal immunization with this vaccine and to investigate whether immune responses were induced by this immunization route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients (n = 18) with advanced B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> received repetitive intradermal vaccinations with 0.5 to 1.65 mg recombinant idiotype Fab fragment mixed with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-based adjuvant in combination with 150 mug granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor s.c. at the same location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients' immune status was assessed by flow cytometry of peripheral blood lymphocytes and concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B vaccination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cellular and humoral immune responses to the vaccine were assessed by enzyme-linked immunospot and ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Side effects of a total of 65 vaccinations were mild and did not affect the immunization schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B surface antibodies (anti-HBs) after two <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B immunizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 17 evaluable patients, five developed specific anti-vaccine antibodies, and eight developed anti-Fab T-cell responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>T-cell reactivity was independent of the cellular immune status and was idiotype specific as shown by statistical regression analysis (P = 0.0024) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> mapping studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intradermal administration of uncoupled recombinant idiotype with appropriate adjuvants may overcome profound clinical immunosuppression and induce specific immune responses </plain></SENT>
