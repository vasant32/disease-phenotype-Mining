<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using laser capture microdissection, we isolated the follicular and monocytoid B-cell components from four well-characterized cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with prominent monocytoid B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA from each component was analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods to assess for clonal rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH) and for the presence of the bcl-2 gene major breakpoint region/joining region (MBR/JH) DNA fusion products by conventional PCR and fluorescence melting curve analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evidence of clonal identity was established in the follicular and monocytoid B-cell components of three cases by demonstration of IgH gene rearrangements of identical size using IgH PCR, by comparison of complementarity determining region III (CDRIII) DNA sequences, or by detection of bcl-2 MBR/JH fusion products of identical size and/or melting temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis of the fourth case revealed a monoclonal and MBR/JH-positive follicular component accompanied by a polyclonal and MBR/JH-negative monocytoid B-cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the follicular and monocytoid B-cell components of this variant of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are clonally identical in the majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in a minority of these cases, the monocytoid B-cell component is reactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Larger studies that assess the prognostic significance of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with monocytoid B-cells will benefit from molecular studies that assess the clonal relationship of both components </plain></SENT>
