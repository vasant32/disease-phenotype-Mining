<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) in advanced stages are currently deemed incurable with standard treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, FL is considered to be eradicable in the small group of patients presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to analyze the clinical features and the outcome of a series of patients with FL in early stages with a long follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 48 patients (25m/23f; median age: 50 yr) diagnosed consecutively with FL in Ann Arbor stage I (25 cases) or II (23) at a single institution with a median follow-up of 9.5 yr were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Main biological and clinical characteristics at diagnosis, including Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) were analyzed; treatment and response were assessed and analyzed for prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The histologic subtypes were: FL type I, 20 cases (42%); type II, 24 (50%); type III, three (6%); and unclassifiable, one (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Distribution according to FLIPI was: low risk (36 cases) and intermediate risk (five cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment mainly consisted of combination chemotherapy (CHOP in 34 cases) plus involved-field radiotherapy in 26 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty patients (89%) achieved a complete response (CR), three (7%) a partial response, and two (4%) were non-responders; the remaining three patients did not receive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No initial variable predicted CR achievement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>About 57% of the patients in CR eventually relapsed with a relapse risk of 46% at 10 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intermediate-risk FLIPI predicted failure-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Histologic transformation was observed in six patients with a 10-yr risk of transformation of 13% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients died during follow-up, in two cases as a result of unrelated causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (OS) at 10 yr was 79% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The FLIPI was the sole variable predicting OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the majority of patients with localized FL achieve CR, the risk of relapse is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The FLIPI is of prognostic value in these patients </plain></SENT>
