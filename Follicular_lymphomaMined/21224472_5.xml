<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Notably, the risk of progression to clinically appreciable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is not yet fully known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of "in situ" <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is feasible when immunohistochemical characterization is carried out and genetic abnormalities are assessed. "In situ" follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is characterized by the presence within the affected germinal centers of B cells that strongly express BCL2 protein, a finding that supports their neoplastic nature, in the absence of interfollicular infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In "in situ" mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involvement is typically limited to the inner mantle zone, where <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells are cyclin D1(+) and weakly BCL2(+), CD5(+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A staging workup to exclude other site of involvement is highly recommended for the possible coexistence of an overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sites of suspicious involvement should be mandatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No evidence for starting therapy also in the presence of multifocal "in situ" <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> exists, and a "wait-and-see policy" is strongly suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A follow-up strategy reserving imaging evaluation only in the presence of disease-related symptoms or organ involvement appears to be a reasonable option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For patients with concomitant overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, staging and treatment procedures must be done according to malignant counterpart </plain></SENT>
