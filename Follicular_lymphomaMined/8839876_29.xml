<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the results of a study in previously untreated advanced stage patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) who underwent uniform induction chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHOP) followed by myeloablative therapy and anti-B-cell monoclonal antibody purged autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighty-three patients with previously untreated, low-grade FL were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After CHOP induction, only 36% achieved complete remission (CR) and 77 patients underwent ABMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before BM harvest, 70 patients had a known t(14;18), as determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> remained PCR positive in the BM at harvest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After ABMT, the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival are estimated to be 63% and 89% at 3 years, respectively, with a median follow-up of 45 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients whose BM was PCR negative after purging experienced significantly longer freedom from recurrence (FFR) than those whose BM remained PCR positive (P = .0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Continued PCR negativity in follow-up BM samples was also strongly predictive of continued CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that a subset of patients with advanced FL may experience prolonged clinical and molecular remissions following high-dose ablative therapy, although longer follow-up will be necessary to determine potential impact on overall survival </plain></SENT>
