<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>His white blood cell count was 30.2 Ã— 10(9)/L with 79% small- to medium-sized lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surface antigen analysis revealed that these lymphocytes were positive for CD19, CD20, CD10, and CD23, but negative for CD5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lymphocytes infiltrated the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On endoscopic examination of the duodenum and jejunum, many small polypoid lesions were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A histologic picture of a biopsied lesion showed diffuse infiltration of small- to medium-sized lymphocytes in the submucosal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On immunohistochemistry, these lymphocytes were positive for CD20, BCL2, and CD10 (weakly) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction analysis of cells from peripheral blood, bone marrow, and intestinal lesion showed a fusion product of BCL2 and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fused BCL2/IGH gene was also demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization in the same cell sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography scanning showed marked wall thickening throughout the small intestine and <z:mp ids='MP_0008466'>enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with massive intestinal involvement in a leukemic state was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After 6 courses of rituximab-combined CHOP chemotherapy, complete remission was obtained </plain></SENT>
