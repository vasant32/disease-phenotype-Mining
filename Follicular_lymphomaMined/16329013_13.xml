<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The potential contribution of this method to the diagnosis and staging of gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> has not yet been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this prospective study was to assess the frequency and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of different forms of intestinal pathology in patients with gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Commercially available capsule video endoscopes were administered to 27 patients (16 men and 11 women, aged 27-77) with known gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CE was also carried out in 30 control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> seven patients with primary intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> who were examined were found to have pathological findings on CE--four with ulcerations, four with nodes, three with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011473'>villous atrophy</z:hpo>, and one with plaques/white villi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> was examined three times before and after chemotherapy, and improvement of the lesions was evident, as well as resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients with gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were examined (16 with low-grade and four with high-grade B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The capsule did not leave the stomach in three patients, suggesting impaired motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The small-bowel transit times were 261+/-41 min for intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 245+/-62 min for gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 224+/-82 min for controls (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five of the 20 patients with gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had pathological findings in the intestine--three with plaques/white villi, two with nodes, and two with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011473'>villous atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In two patients, subsequent biopsies revealed secondary follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CE is a valuable diagnostic tool for defining the extent of bowel involvement and assessing the efficacy of treatment in patients with gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
