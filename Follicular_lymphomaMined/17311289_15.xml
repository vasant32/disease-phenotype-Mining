<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyze the relationship between sun exposure and malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in a multicenter, population-based case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 710, 18-80 years) were prospectively recruited in 6 study regions in Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For each case, a gender, region and age-matched control was drawn from population-registers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In personal interviews, lifetime holidays spent in sunny climate, outdoor leisure activities and sunbed or sunlamp use were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On basis of job task-specific supplementary questionnaires, an occupational physician assessed the cumulative working time outside </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (OR) and 95%-confidence-intervals (CI) were calculated using conditional logistic regression analysis, adjusted for smoking and alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To increase statistical power, patients with specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subentities were additionally compared with the entire control group using unconditional logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We observed a reduced overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> risk among subjects having spent vacations at sunny climates or frequently used sunbeds or sunlamps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subentities revealed similar results with the exception of T-NHL and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> which were positively associated with outdoor leisure activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While cumulative working time outside appeared unrelated to NHL overall and most subentities, it was negatively associated with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and weakly positively to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This data suggest that exposure to natural and artificial ultraviolet radiation may reduce the OR for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in this study population </plain></SENT>
