<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To better clarify CD23 role as a diagnostic tool, the authors retrospectively evaluated clinical and laboratory features of 372 patients who were referred to M.D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anderson <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center with a diagnosis of CLL or B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most of the patients (91%) were CD19+/CD5+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 6% of these CD19+/CD5+ patients were CD23- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, CD23- patients had the worse prognostic features compared with CD23+ cases, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (P = 0.03), massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> (P = 0.000), high <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (P = 0.007), high beta2-microglobulin (P = 0.006), older age (P = 0.001), and male gender (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surface immunoglobulin expression was moderate/strong in 19 (82%) patients, and FMC-7 was positive in 22 (96%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the 13 patients tested for CD10 expressed the antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, of the CD23, 16 (70%) were diagnosed with mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) was diagnosed in 16 (70%) CD23- patients, 3 (13%) with splenic marginal-zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, 3 (13%) with prolymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53412">PLL</z:chebi>) or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53412">PLL</z:chebi>/CLL, and 1 (4%) with CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No cyclin D1 protein expression was noted by Western blot analysis in the one case that showed typical CLL <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and this patient did not require therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the whole, the survival rate of CD23- patients was significantly worse than that of patients with CD23+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 15 of 32 (49%) CD19+/CD5- patients were CD23- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CD23 negativity in this group was not associated with distinct clinical features or outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Eleven (73%) of these patients were classified as having splenic marginal-zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 4 as having follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that CD23 negativity is rare in typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023434" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BCLL">B-cell CLL</z:e>, and CD23 negativity in patients with CD19+/CD5+ is suggestive of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> a more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> with poor response to conventional therapy in which newer chemotherapy regimens such as hyper-CVAD may be more effective </plain></SENT>
