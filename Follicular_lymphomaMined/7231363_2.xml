<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We attempted to induce in vivo clonal growth of neoplastic lymphoid cells from fresh specimens of involved tissue from 22 patients with no-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conditioned media derived from two human B-lymphocyte tissue culture lines were tested for their ability to promote colony growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we compared the incidence of colony induction to the flash-3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> labeling index (LI) of the cells in the tissues cultured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Successful colony induction occurred in three-tenths of the cases of diffuse histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and one-half of the cases of nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cloning efficiencies were low, ranging from 0.0003 to 0.04% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no apparent relationship between successful instances of cloning and LI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have confirmed the observations of Jones et al that <z:mp ids='MP_0002022'>lymphoid tumor</z:mp> cells can be cloned from tissues involved by NHL using a soft agar system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The possibility of using such systems for clinical predictive assays of chemotherapeutic drug toxicity toward <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells of NHL is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that further refinements of the assays are desirable before they can be applied to widespread clinical use </plain></SENT>
