<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IFN gained the distinction of being the first recombinant cytokine to be licensed in the USA for the treatment of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in 1986, with the approval of IFN-α2a (Hoffman-La Roche) and IFN-α2b (Schering-Plough) for the treatment of Hairy Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to this application, other approved antitumor applications for IFN-α2a are <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0100726'>Kaposi's Sarcoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) and other approved antitumor applications for IFN-α2b are <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>Malignant Melanoma</z:hpo>, Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related Kapoisi's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>Sarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the ensuing years, a considerable number of studies have been conducted to establish the mechanisms of the induction and action of IFN's anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These include identifying the role of Interferon Regulatory Factor 9 (IRF9) as a key factor in eliciting the antiproliferative effects of IFN-α as well as identifying genes induced by IFN that are involved in recognition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recent studies also show that IFN-activated human monocytes can be used to achieve &gt;95% eradication of select <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The signaling pathways by which IFN induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> can vary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IFN treatment induces the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene p53, which plays a role in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> for some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, but it is not essential for the apoptotic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IFN-α also activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which is associated with cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Downstream of PI3K is the mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> (mTOR) which, in conjunction with PI3K, may act in signaling induced by growth factors after IFN treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This paper will explore the mechanisms by which IFN acts to elicit its antiproliferative effects and more closely examine the clinical applications for the anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> potential of IFN </plain></SENT>
