<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The best treatment of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> remains to be determined because the long natural history of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> requires mature data for accurate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the goal of primary treatment remains durable remission, the sequential application of effective treatments may also result in a prolongation of median survival time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of interferon (IFN) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy has demonstrated an increase of event-free survival but not in overall survival; however, its <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and late cardiac toxicity limits its use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this reason, we began a controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy: COPP (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, and procarbazine) + IFN alternating every month for six cycles compared to six cycles of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In an intent-to treat analysis, 55 patients were enrolled (median age 61 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most cases (91%) with advanced disease were randomly assigned to chemotherapy + IFN (28 cases) or chemotherapy (27 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete remission was observed in 16 patients: 59% (95% CI, 53-70%) in the chemotherapy arm compared to 20 patients 71% (95% CI, 58-79%) in the chemotherapy + IFN arm; total responses were 74% and 86%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 60 months, event-free survival was 100% for patients treated with chemotherapy + IFN, which was statistically different from patients treated with chemotherapy 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 7 years, median survival has not yet been reached; 72% of patients chemotherapy + IFN remain alive without disease (95% CI, 59-81%), which is not statistically different from 72% (95%CI, 50-73%) in the chemotherapy arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Non-hematological toxicity was most frequent and severe in the chemotherapy arm; hematological toxicity was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, it appears that chemotherapy + IFN, as described herein, improves event-free survival but the overall survival rates remain unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of COPP appears to be better that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy because it avoids the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and late cardiac toxicity </plain></SENT>
