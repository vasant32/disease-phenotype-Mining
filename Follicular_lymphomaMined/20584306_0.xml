<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a rare case of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of fallopian tube in a 68-year-old woman who underwent total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012114'>endometrial carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The specimen showed a well-differentiated endometrioid <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> with superficial myometrial invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The left fallopian tube revealed a 1 cm nodule that histologically showed diffuse lymphoid follicles consisting of small cleaved lymphocytes and occasional larger cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cells were immunopositive for CD20, BCL-2, and BCL-6 but negative for CD3 and CD43 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction confirmed a monoclonal B-cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in-situ hybridization revealed at (14, 18) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient had absent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> and negative CT scan of chest, abdomen, and pelvis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The findings were consistent with a primary low grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of fallopian tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>She did not receive chemotherapy and remained disease free for 13 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our case suggests that primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of fallopian tube may be associated with a favorable prognosis </plain></SENT>
