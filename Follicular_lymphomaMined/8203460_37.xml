<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been shown to prolong cell survival by preventing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endometrium undergoes rapid proliferation and differentiation under hormone control and is thus an excellent model to study the hormone dependency of Bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied Bcl-2 expression by an immunohistochemical method in 53 samples of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> endometrium randomly distributed throughout the menstrual cycle, as well as five samples of <z:mp ids='MP_0009092'>hyperplastic endometrium</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 staining predominated in glandular cells and peaked at the end of the follicular phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 expression disappeared at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of secretory activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The stroma, surface lining epithelium and arterial vessels also displayed cyclic variations in Bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results strongly suggest hormone-dependent regulation of Bcl-2 expression, which could play an important role in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
