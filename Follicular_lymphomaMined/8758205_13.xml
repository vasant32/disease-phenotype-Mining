<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal abnormalities involving 3q27 have recently been associated with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and, less frequently, with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular studies have led to the identification of the BCL-6/LAZ-3 gene, located at 3q27 and coding for a putative zinc-finger protein that might act as a transcriptional regulator during cell differentiation and development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rearrangement of BCL-6 results in truncation of the gene in its 5' portion, leaving the protein intact; a resultant deregulation of its expression has been hypothesized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to test this hypothesis, the expression of BCL-6 protein was investigated in human reactive lymphoid tissue and compared with a group of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHLs) with or without 3q27 anomalies and/or BCL-6 gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BCL-6 protein is consistently expressed in reactive lymphoid tissues, where it is restricted to the follicle centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The protein is also widely expressed in NHL: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> tested showed a pattern of expression similar to the reactive B follicle, independently of the presence of BCL-6 gene rearrangement and/or 3q27 anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, there was more variation in BCL-6 expression, but a correlation with 3q27 anomalies and/or BCL-6 rearrangement was not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Deregulation of the BCL-6 gene did not result in an aberrant tissue expression as detected by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
