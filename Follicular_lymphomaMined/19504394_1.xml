<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical relevance of the presence and extent of diffuse growth areas within LGFL is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we studied 457 patients with nodal LGFL seen over a 20-year period (1982-2002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relevant clinical and survival data were obtained and the pathology specimens were subclassified into predominantly follicular LGFL (&gt;or=80% follicular areas), significantly follicular LGFL (30-70% follicular areas), significantly diffuse LGFL (&lt;30% follicular areas) and pure diffuse follicle centre <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DFCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of the patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with DFCL were slightly older (median age, 67 years), more likely to have bulky disease (&gt;5 cm), and often had suboptimal biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, no association was observed between the extent of diffuse areas and survival across the four subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the subclassification of LGFL based on the extent of diffuse areas does not have clinical relevance </plain></SENT>
