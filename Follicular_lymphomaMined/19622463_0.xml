<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients had an ECOG performance of 0-2, and Stage III and IV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both untreated and previously treated patients with progressive disease were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received a combination of rituximab 375 mg/m(2), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 1000 mg/m(2), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> 1.4 mg/m(2) (up to a maximal dose of 2 mg), administered by intravenous infusion every two weeks, for ten treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">Prednisone</z:chebi> 50 mg was administered every other day orally for thirty days and then tapered over the next thirty days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSf) was administered on days seven to ten following each cycle of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 5 and 10 cycles, patients were evaluated for response that included imaging with Ct and pet scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 10 patients (7 untreated and 3 previously treated) were enrolled into this pilot study between may 2003 and July 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Untreated patients received an average of 8.3 cycles of therapy (range 5 to 10 cycles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven of 7 untreated patients achieved a complete response (CR), and 5 had not relapsed as of 32-43 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Previously treated patients received an average of 9.3 cycles of therapy (range 6 to 12 cycles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One of three previously treated patients achieved a complete response and has no evidence of relapse at 29 months. the other two heavily pretreated patients achieved partial responses, lasting 2 and 5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was mild consisting mainly of parasthesias requiring attenuation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no instances of neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> requiring hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This program is well tolerated with a high CR rate, and may serve as a basis for future trials </plain></SENT>
