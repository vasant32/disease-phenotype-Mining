<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Immunologic differences among the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> B <z:hpo ids='HP_0005526'>lymphoid leukemias</z:hpo> defined by the French-American-British (FAB) classification were evaluated with respect to IgE isotype switching induced by anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We immunocytochemically studied IgE isotype switching of leukemic B cells from 25 cases and three cell lines established from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> after stimulation with anti-CD40 mAb, plus each of the following cytokines: interleukin 2 (IL-2); IL-4; IL-10; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF-alpha); and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also, genomic Cepsilon and Cepsilon transcripts were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Leukemic cells from hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> variant and its cell line, with deletion of the Cepsilon gene, did not undergo IgE isotype switching in response to any of the stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a cell line (FH-5) established from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> cells, bearing the Cepsilon gene, underwent the highest level of IgE isotype switching on stimulation with anti-CD40 mAb and IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This response was correlated with the production of Cepsilon transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IL-4, IL-10, and TNF-alpha induced higher levels of IgE isotype switching than the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No IgE isotype switching was observed in any of the non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> examined, except mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Percentages of CD40(+) cells in five cases with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were significantly lower than the other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IgE isotype switching induced by anti-CD40 mAb with cytokines other than IL-4 was first demonstrated, whereas none of the non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> except mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed IgE isotype switching in response to any of the stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cells of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were suggested to be different from cells of the other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
