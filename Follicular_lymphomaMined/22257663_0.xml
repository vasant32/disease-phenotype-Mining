<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Primary follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the epididymis in an adult is extremely rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little is known about primary adult paratesticular/epididimal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: We report a rare case of primary follicular non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the epididymis in a 90-year-old Caucasian man who presented with a left scrotal mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow biopsy was negative and computed tomography of the total body revealed no evidence of extratesticular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Macroscopically, the epididymis was replaced completely by a uniform mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histologic studies revealed a dense lymphoid infiltrate predominantly composed of centrocytes with admixed centroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that neoplastic cells strongly expressed CD45RB, CD20, CD79a, bcl-6 and CD10; bcl-2 immunostaining was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molecular studies showed the presence of the monoclonal IgH gene rearrangement and the IgH/BCL2 rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was classified as follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, low grade, grade 1-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient subsequently underwent radical orchiectomy, did not receive chemotherapy and post-operative follow-up showed absence of disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The case of primary follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of epididymis, reported here, is considered a very rare event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by clinically indolent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e>, a good clinical outcome, lack of expression of BCL2 protein and the presence of the t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IGH-BCL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Even if it is a single case, the primary follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> epididymis with t(14;18) could represent either a variant of the previously reported t(14;18)-negative primary paratesticular follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or a distinct biological entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>To report additional cases in the future would be helpful in resolving this question </plain></SENT>
