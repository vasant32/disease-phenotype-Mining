<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Whether primary cutaneous follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (PCFL) may or not represent a cutaneous equivalent to nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is not determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have therefore investigated a series of PCFL to determine if tumoral cells carry or not the t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation, a cytogenetic hallmark of nodal FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty cases of PFCL were selected according to the criteria of both the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and the World Health Organization with 21 cases classified as grade 1 or 2 and 9 cases as grade 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037286" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cutaneous tumors</z:e> were studied by PCR for the amplification of bcl-2/JH rearrangements and by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization using a dual color probe spanning t(14;18) breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Second, we tried to determine the origin of bcl2-JH-positive cells by a parallel bcl2-JH and immunoglobulin heavy chain gene amplification of blood mononuclear cells DNA and of DNA extracted from single microdissected B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bcl2-JH rearrangements were amplified by PCR in skin of 9 of 30 (30%) patients with a similar-sized bcl2-JH rearrangement detected in the blood of 7 of these 9 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No t(14;18) breakpoint was detected by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of 11 bcl2-JH-negative and 5 bcl2-JH-positive PCFL in contrast with its detection in the secondary cutaneous FL and in the nodal FL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Single-cell/multigene analysis showed that no single monoclonal B cells of PCFL carried the bcl2-JH rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bystander or nontumoral t(14;18)+ B cells emigrating from blood may account for the detection of bcl2-JH rearrangements within PCFL material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study also underlines the diagnostic value of interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization to discriminate between t(14;18)-negative PCFL and extracutaneous FL involving the skin </plain></SENT>
