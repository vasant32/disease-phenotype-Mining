<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: AME-133v is a humanized monoclonal antibody engineered to have increased affinity to CD20 and mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) better than rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy were assessed in a phase 1/2 trial in patients with previously treated follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: AME-133v was characterized in vitro by ADCC and cell binding assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A phase 1 study was conducted in which 23 previously treated patients with FL were assigned sequentially to one of five dose-escalation cohorts of AME-133v at 2, 7.5, 30, 100, or 375 mg/m(2) weekly × 4 doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AME-133v showed a 13- to 20-fold greater binding affinity for CD20 and was 5- to 7-fold more potent than rituximab in ADCC assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell binding assays showed AME-133v and rituximab competed for an overlapping <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> on the CD20 antigen, and AME-133v inhibited binding of biotinylated rituximab to CD20 in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AME-133v was well tolerated by patients and common related adverse events included chills and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient experienced a dose-limiting toxicity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AME-133v showed nonlinear pharmocokinetics with properties similar to rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Selective reduction of B cells during and after AME-133v treatment was shown by flow cytometry of peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A partial or complete response was observed in 5 of 23 (22%) patients and the median progression-free survival was 25.4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AME-133v was safe and well tolerated at the doses tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>AME-133v showed encouraging results as an anti-CD20 therapy in heavily pretreated FL patients with the less favorable FcγRIIIa F-carrier genotype </plain></SENT>
