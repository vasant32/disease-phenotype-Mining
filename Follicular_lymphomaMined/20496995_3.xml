<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> may have potential as anticancer therapies in low-grade non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), and a recent observational study found <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use was associated with improved event free survival in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other studies have suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> reduce the efficacy of rituximab by inhibiting binding to CD20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore conducted an observational cohort study of 686 patients with newly diagnosed Rai <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278718" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage 0 CLL</z:e> to evaluate whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use was related to their clinical outcome or influenced the efficacy of rituximab therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, 136 (20%) patients took <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> and 230 (34%) scheduled daily aspirin, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi>, or naproxen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No difference in time to treatment was observed based on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients receiving a rituximab-containing first-line therapy, no difference in time to salvage treatment was observed based on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although previous studies suggested <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> may improve event free survival among patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we find no impact of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> on time to initial therapy in this large study of patients with Rai <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278718" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage 0 CLL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The in vitro observation that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> reduce rituximab efficacy does not appear to have clinical significance in CLL care </plain></SENT>
