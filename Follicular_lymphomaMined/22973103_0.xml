<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IFNα-2b was first added to a mixture of an aqueous solution of <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mixture solution was stirred in a magnetic stirrer at a rate of 2000 rpm for 45 seconds at 0°C ± 0.5°C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The solution was then prefrozen at different temperatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi> and IFNα-2b partitioned in the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi> phase were preferentially separated out as the dispersed phase from the mixture solution during the prefreezing process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then the prefrozen sample was freeze-dried to powder form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In order to remove the <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>, the powder was washed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15767">dichloromethane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Once IFNα-2b was loaded into the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi> nanoparticles, these nanoparticles could gain resistance to vapor-water and water-oil interfaces to protect IFNα-2b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The antiviral activity of the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi> nanoparticles in vitro was highly preserved (above 97%), while the antiviral activity of IFNα-2b-loaded <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi> nanoparticles using the control water-in-oil-in-water method was only 71% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The antiviral activity of the IFNα-2b from blood samples was also determined on the basis of the activity to inhibit the cytopathic effects of the Sindbis virus on Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The antiviral activity in vivo was also highly preserved (above 97%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi> nanoparticles could be processed to different formulations according to clinical requirements </plain></SENT>
