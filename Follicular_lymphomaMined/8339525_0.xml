<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the basis of membrane phenotype, cytochemistry, ultrastructural examination of blood and marrow lymphocytes, differential diagnosis was between <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphatic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), CLL of mixed cell type, hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (HCL), HCL variant, splenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with circulating villous lymphocytes (SLVL), Non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of mantle zone (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The application of morphologic and immunological methods has reinforced the value of cytomorphology and has proved advantageous in increasing our understanding of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of B CLL itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A new classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> B <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> has been proposed on the basis of clinical, cytomorphological, histological, cytochemical, immunological criteria: CLL; CLL of mixed cell type including cases with more than 10% and less than 55% prolymphocytes (CLL/P) and a less well defined form with pleomorphic lymphocytes (CLL/P) and a less well defined form with pleomorphic lymphocytes but less than 10% prolymphocytes; prolymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53412">PLL</z:chebi>); hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (HCL); HCL variant; splenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with circulating villous lymphocytes (SLVL); leukemic phase of NHL (follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, intermediate or mantle zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and others); lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; plasma cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Even if the application of cytomorphological and immunological criteria has increased our knowledge of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> B <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, in some cases, as in the one reported, exact classification may be very difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, on the basis of clinical and laboratory criteria this case can be classified as SLVL, notwithstanding some discrepancies of the immunophenotype </plain></SENT>
