<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to determine the most efficient strategy, we have compared three known methods, using consensus primers against the VH FR3 or FR2 (FR256) regions, or a mix of six primers against the FR1 region (FR1f), with a new approach using a consensus primer against FR1 (FR1c), never previously described for diagnostic purposes, on DNA from 89 monoclonal B-cell proliferations (16 ALL, 28 CLL/PLL, 15 <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myelomas</z:mp>, 30 NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We obtained a detection rate of 70% for FR3, 64% for FR1f and 77% and 78% for FR256 and FR1c, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Polyclonal lymphocytes and mature T cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> tested negative for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences in the detection rate were related not only to the choice of VH primer but also the JH primer(s) used and the pathological subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> strategies led to adequate detection of leukaemic DNA, whereas the detection rate in <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> varied between strategies from 47 to 80% and that of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from 13 to 63% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lowest detection rates were observed in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in mature CD5 negative proliferations, reflecting the probable correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> and PCR false-negativity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combined use of FR1c and FR256 allowed detection in at least one system of 92% of cases overall and at least 75% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pathological subtypes, thus providing a simple, reliable and rapid non-radioactive system for the detection of B cell clonality </plain></SENT>
