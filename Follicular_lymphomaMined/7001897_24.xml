<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A leukemic phase occurred in 30 (14 percent) of 214 patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the significance of peripheral blood involvement in each type of NHL, patients were subdivided according to a modified Rappaport classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each histologic subtype presented a homogeneous clinical picture which differed from that seen in other histologic subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of particular note was the recognition of two distinctive cytologic and clinical subtypes within the category of nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, poorly differentiated lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NPDL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one subtype, the predominant cells had cytologic features akin to those of lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these cases, although the interval to peripheral blood involvement was variable, the median leukemic survival was only two months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast in conventional NPDL the median leukemic survival was 43+ months, and peripheral blood involvement did not appear to exert an independent effect on prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> the median leukemic survival was 0.5 months, with peripheral blood involvement appearing as a terminal event associated with unresponsive disease in multiple sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The recognition of adult lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> as a clinicopathologic entity with a high risk of leukemic conversion, 100 percent in this study, is also confirmed </plain></SENT>
