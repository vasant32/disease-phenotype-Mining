<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Most studies describing the subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Jordan were carried out in the 1980s at a time when immunohistochemical facilities were unavailable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a database established after immunohistochemical studies were introduced, we determined the frequency of the various types of nodal and extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in the adult and paediatric Jordanian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also assessed the incidence of bone marrow involvement at the initial presentation for each <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the histopathological subtypes of various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was conducted on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases diagnosed during a 3-year period between January 2001 and December 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 347 patients included in the study, 78.4% had non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and 21.6% had Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the NHL group, diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was the most common (28.2%) followed by follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (15.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> group, the nodular <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> variant was the most frequent (7.8%) followed by the mixed cellularity type (5.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases, the highest incidence of marrow involvement was seen in patients with lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine patients were children (age &lt;15 years) in whom Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (15 cases) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> (14 cases) were the commonest subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One-hundred six patients with primary extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (ENL) accounted for 30.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a higher incidence of NHL in Jordan compared with other series in the Middle East </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among the various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is the most commonly encountered <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> are the most frequent childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, followed closely by lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
