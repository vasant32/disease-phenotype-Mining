<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, analysis by Fluorescence in situ hybridization of BCL6 gene aberrations in 100 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases without IGH/BCL2 rearrangement resulted in the identification of four subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group I: BCL6 gene rearrangement (n=41); Group II: BCL6 gene amplification/3q27 gain (n=30); Group III: the absence of both (n=23); and Group IV: the presence of both (n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group II showed higher grade <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> (Grade 3a/b: 93%), higher bcl2 and MUM1 expression (73 and 57%, respectively), and more frequent combination with BCL2 gene amplification/18q21 gain (90%) than the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BCL6 gene aberration, especially amplification/3q27 gain, indicates the presence of certain morphological and phenotypical findings in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases without IGH/BCL2 rearrangement </plain></SENT>
