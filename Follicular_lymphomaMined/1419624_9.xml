<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These are usually detected by Southern blotting techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the ability of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA from 14 follicular and 42 diffuse B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was examined using oligonucleotide primers specific for opposing sides of the IgH gene rearrangement on chromosome 14 (towards conserved VH and JH sequences) and opposing sides of the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation (towards the major breakpoint region of the bcl-2 gene on chromosome 18 and conserved JH sequence on chromosome 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18) translocation was detected in 57% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 21% of diffuse B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clonal IgH gene rearrangements using PCR were detected in 50% follicular and 52% of the diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Either or both of these rearrangements were detected in 93% follicular and in 59% of diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PCR is a rapid and easy technique that can detect the abnormal rearrangement of the bcl-2 gene and clonal IgH rearrangement, indicating the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This may be of benefit in monitoring response to therapy and in predicting prognosis in this disease </plain></SENT>
