<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: More than 80% of the patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> have a characteristic chromosomal translocation, t(14;18)(q32;q21), at the major breakpoint region (MBR) or minor cluster region (MCR) involving the bcl-2 oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to assess the significance of the molecular response rate measured by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) evidence of translocation among patients with Stage I to III follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated with central lymphatic irradiation (CLI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-three patients with Stage I-III follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were treated with CLI on a prospective protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples were obtained before CLI for PCR analysis of t(14;18)(q32; q21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PCR-positive patients were followed by PCR analysis at regular intervals during and after CLI, and the results were correlated with clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The following pretreatment factors were also investigated for their relationship to relapse and molecular response: gender, age, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) and beta-2 microglobulin (beta2M) levels, Ann Arbor stage, and International Prognostic Index (IPI) for malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The subjects were 19 men and 14 women, with a median age of 52 years (range 30-69), who started CLI between January 1993 and February 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 44 months (range 12-67), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 2 patients were still alive at the last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients were Stage IA, 8 were Stage IIA, 19 were Stage IIIA, and 2 were Stage IIIB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0002943'>abnormal LDH levels</z:mp> (&gt; 618 U/dL) and 7 patients had abnormal beta2M levels (&gt; 2 mg/dL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had IPI = 0, 16 had IPI = 1, and 8 had IPI = 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients achieved complete response (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients have relapsed to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The median overall time to relapse was 54 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The actuarial proportion of patients free from relapse at 3 years was 87% (95% confidence interval [CI] 69-95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A total of 287 PCR results were available, 64 from bone marrow and 223 from peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment PCR data were available for 27 patients, of whom 21 were positive and 3 were unambiguously negative (in blood and bone marrow for both MBR and MCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>For the 19 PCR positive patients for whom we had post-treatment results, there was a clear and steady decreasing trend toward loss of PCR positivity (49% positive for bone marrow and 32% positive for peripheral blood at 3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>There was a clear trend for increasing PCR positivity with increasing IPI: 10% for IPI = 0, 31% for IPI = 1, and 63% for IPI = 2 at 3 years for blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The same trend was also observed for bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The IPI was the only statistically significant predictor for relapse with a relapse-free survival of 91% at 3 years for IPI &lt; 2 and 75% for IPI = 2 (p = 0.024, log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Molecular response to CLI occurs gradually over years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>High IPI is a negative predictor for molecular response and relapse-free survival </plain></SENT>
