<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, distributions of lymphocyte cell membrane markers for T cells and B cells were determined in ten of 11 cases of nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lymphocyte suspensions in five cases contained monoclonal immunoglobulins and in three cases neoplastic cells showed a lack of surface membrane immunoglobulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two cases, the distribution of lymphocyte surface markers could not be distinguished from cells of benign lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Combined data from intracytoplasmic immunoglobulin studies and lymphocyte surface marker assays indicated that eight of ten cases are of B cell lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the detection of intracellular immunoglobulin is not helpful in differentiating benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> from nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but is complementary to lymphocyte surface marker assays in the determination of the origin of neoplastic cells in lymphoreticular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
