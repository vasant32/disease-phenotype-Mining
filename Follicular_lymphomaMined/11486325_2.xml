<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intrasplenic venous blood flow was in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> direction at the hilum of the spleen but in a reversed direction at the periphery of the spleen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This type of reversed intrasplenic flow pattern results in portosystemic shunting and might be detected more frequently when careful color Doppler mapping of the entire splenic parenchyma is performed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001409'>portal hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of this phenomenon, however, is still unclear </plain></SENT>
