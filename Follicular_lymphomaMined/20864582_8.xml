<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this article, we report our clinical experience in 142 consecutive patients who received <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-131 rituximab radioimmunotherapy for low-grade, predominantly follicular, relapsed NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Objective response rates of 67%, with complete response (CR) in 50% and median overall survival of 32 months, matched the response rates in a phase 2 clinical trial of (131)I-rituximab radioimmunotherapy and compares favorably with those reported for (131)I-tositumomab or (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival was 18 months overall and 32 months in CR or CR-unconfirmed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our patients comprised 107 (75%) follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 21 (15%) small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 6 (4%) mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue/marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 8 (6%) mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, with median follow-up of 32 months and 8-year overall survival of 48% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was limited to hematologic grade 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, occurring in 10% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in 6% </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Radioimmunotherapy with (131)I-rituximab in routine clinical outpatient practice provides cost-effective, safe treatment of relapsed/refractory indolent NHL, with half of patients achieving durable, complete remission with potential for repeat radioimmunotherapy on relapse </plain></SENT>
