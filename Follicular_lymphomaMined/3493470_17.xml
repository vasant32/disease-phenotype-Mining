<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cell surface markers of 75 cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were studied on cryostat sections using a panel of monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine cases (65.3%) were found to express a B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp>, 23 cases (30.7%) a T-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp>, 1 case (1.3%) a histiocytic phenotype and 2 cases (2.7%) no demonstrable surface markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> accounted for only 10.7% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> expressed IgM-lambda or IgM-IgD-lambda, but a few failed to express surface immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 23 cases of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 22 were of peripheral T-cell type; most were of helper-cell (T4) phenotype and a significant number expressed J5 (CALLA) and I2 (HLA-DR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present study shows that the percentage of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Chinese is higher than in Caucasians, but lower than in Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, when the age-adjusted incidence of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is considered, the incidence rates of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Hong Kong Chinese and Japanese in areas non-endemic for adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0005517'>T-cell lymphoma/leukemia</z:hpo> are similar; the incidence in Americans is similar or slightly lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The major difference between the races is that B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, particularly the follicular type, is much rarer in Asians than Americans </plain></SENT>
