<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incidence of B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (B-NHL) at nodal and extranodal sites is fairly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) occur predominantly at nodal sites and rarely in the gastrointestinal tract, while marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>) of the mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue (MALT) type predominate in the digestive organs and especially in the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a 72-year-old female patient admitted for gastroscopy because of epigastric pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The antral biopsies showed dense lymphocytic infiltrates, partially forming follicles with widened marginal zones and monocytoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple lymphoepithelial lesions (LEL) were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> of the MALT type was suspected morphologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the lymphatic infiltrates to be CD20, bcl-2, bcl-6 and CD10 positive, and negative for CD43, CD5 and cyclin D1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PCR-based analysis showed a JH/bcl-2 rearrangement, corresponding to the translocation t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An extranodal FL mimicking <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present case is remarkable, as it demonstrates that the detection of LEL and monocytoid B-cells, although suggestive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>, is not entirely specific and can also be observed in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pathologists should be aware of this diagnostic pitfall in classifying gastric B-NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In equivocal cases, a careful morphological examination, supported by specific immunohistochemical and molecular findings, should lead to the correct diagnosis </plain></SENT>
