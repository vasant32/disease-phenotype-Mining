<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the usefulness of ready made macroarrays as routine diagnostic tools in haematopathology, lymph node biopsies were analysed using a cDNA macroarray containing genes involved in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, including caspases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine biopsy specimens were analysed using total frozen tissues: four samples of B cell follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, two of B cell diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and three of non-neoplastic lymph nodes from benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0002840'>lymphadenitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine cell populations were sorted from fresh tissues: malignant B cells from two patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and two with diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, reactive B cells from two benign lymph nodes, reactive T cells from one benign lymph node, and virgin (mantle zone) B cells and germinal centre B cells from benign tonsils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) on paraffin wax sections was performed for the localisation of caspases 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the clustered array data, sorted cells from samples sharing common histological lesions were grouped together, whereas the array/histology correlation was less satisfactory for tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression profiles of both the array and IHC methods correlated for most caspases and samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Variations in array profiles of sorted cell populations can be associated with specific histological features, suggesting a possible diagnostic application of ready made <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> macroarrays in haematopathology </plain></SENT>
