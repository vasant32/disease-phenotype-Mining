<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rituximab (RTX), a monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 protein, is a drug commonly used in the treatment of B-cell-derived lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> and of antibody-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to cell- and complement-mediated B-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, RTX is thought to inhibit B-cell survival and proliferation through negative regulation of canonical signaling pathways involving Akt, ERK, and mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, surprisingly, although B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling has been considered critical for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and more recently, for neoplastic B cells, the hypothesis that RTX could target BCR has never been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines as models, as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells, we show here, for the first time, that pretreatment with RTX results in a time-dependent inhibition of the BCR-signaling cascade involving Lyn, Syk, PLC gamma 2, Akt, and ERK, and calcium mobilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effect of RTX correlates with decrease of raft-associated cholesterol, complete inhibition of BCR relocalization into <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> raft microdomains, and down-regulation of BCR immunoglobulin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, RTX-mediated alteration of BCR expression, dynamics, and signaling might contribute to the immunosuppressive activity of the drug </plain></SENT>
