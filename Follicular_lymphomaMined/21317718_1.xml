<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rarely, histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> (HS) occurs secondary to or concurrent with FL, although the biological relationship between these 2 morphologically and immunophenotypically distinct entities in the same individual has not been well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a unique case showing the sequential occurrence of first, HS and then <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> in a patient with a remote history of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this case, HS developed 17 years after the diagnosis of FL and was shown to partly retain the immunophenotypic features characteristic of FL, while showing the morphologic and immunophenotypic profiles diagnostic of HS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> occurred 18.5 years after FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both HS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> harbored the IGH/BCL2 fusion gene, a hallmark of FL, per interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin gene rearrangement studies showed a clonal rearrangement of the IGH gene in both HS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> with identical amplicons, suggesting a shared origin of the neoplastic clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data support the hypothesis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_85'>transdifferentiation</z:mpath> or transevolution in a mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, and, in addition, suggest the possibility of a divergent (bilineal) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> of FL in a single individual </plain></SENT>
