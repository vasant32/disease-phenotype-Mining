<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now report that it exists in 2 forms with different N-glycosylation patterns in the mu-constant region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One glycoform is similar to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells in bearing mature complex <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> common to most cell-surface <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other is an immature mannosylated form more characteristic of mu chains in the endoplasmic reticulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unmutated CLL (U-CLL) expresses a higher proportion of mannosylated surface mu chains than mutated CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> B cells express only the mature glycoform but can express the immature form after persistent engagement of sIgM, suggesting that glycan modification is a consequence of antigen exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CLL cells express variable proportions of the mannosylated form and can revert to the mature form after incubation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both glycoforms are able to signal after sIgM engagement in vitro, leading to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings support the concept that CLL cells are continuously exposed to antigen in vivo, driving the N-glycosylation pattern of expressed sIgM toward a mannosylated form, especially in U-CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, this is reminiscent of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, where mannosylated Ig is expressed constitutively via N-glycosylation sites in the variable region, suggesting a functional asset for this glycoform </plain></SENT>
