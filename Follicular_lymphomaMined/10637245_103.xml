<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A multicenter phase II study was conducted to assess the toxicity and the overall response rates (RR) and complete response (CR) rates to rituximab (chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1997 and January 1998, 131 patients with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> (MCL1; n = 34) and previously treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> (MCL2; n = 40), IMC (n = 28), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e> (n = 29) received rituximab 375 mg/m(2)/wk for 4 weeks via intravenous infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Restaging studies were performed 1 and 2 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An analysis of the duration of response was conducted in December 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven patients were unassessable, including one who died of splenic rupture after the first infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The RR among the 120 assessable patients was 30% (36 of 120 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The RR by histology was as follows: MCL1, 38%; MCL2, 37%; IMC, 28%; and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>, 14% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, achieved CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median duration of response in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> was 1.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immediate side effects were common and usually responded to adjustments in the infusion rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were 31 episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> after treatment; most cases were mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> and ophthalmologic side effects occurred in 10 and nine patients, respectively, including one case of severe loss of visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Single-agent rituximab has moderate activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> and IMC but only limited activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The duration of response in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> was similar to that previously reported in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Its use in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy to increase the CR rate is warranted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> and IMC </plain></SENT>
