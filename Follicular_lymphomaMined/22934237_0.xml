<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Conventional tissue microarrays (<z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMAs</z:chebi>) consist of cores of tissue inserted into a recipient paraffin block such that a tissue section on a single glass slide can contain numerous patient samples in a spatially structured pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Scanning <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMAs</z:chebi> into digital slides for subsequent analysis by computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) algorithms <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> offers the possibility of evaluating candidate algorithms against a near-complete repertoire of variable disease <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphologies</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This parallel interrogation approach simplifies the evaluation, validation, and comparison of such candidate algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A recently developed digital tool, digital core (dCORE), and image microarray maker (iMAM) enables the capture of uniformly sized and resolution-matched images, with these representing key morphologic features and fields of view, aggregated into a single monolithic digital image file in an array format, which we define as an image microarray (IMA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further define the <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi>-IMA construct as IMA-based images derived from whole slide images of <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMAs</z:chebi> themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Here we describe the first combined use of the previously described dCORE and iMAM tools, toward the goal of generating a higher-order image construct, with multiple <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> cores from multiple distinct conventional <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMAs</z:chebi> assembled as a single digital image montage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This image construct served as the basis of the carrying out of a massively parallel image analysis exercise, based on the use of the previously described spatially invariant vector quantization (SIVQ) algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multicase, multifield <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi>-IMAs of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> were separately rendered, using the aforementioned tools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Each of these two IMAs contained a distinct spectrum of morphologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> with respect to both tingible body macrophage (TBM) appearance and apoptotic body <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SIVQ-based pattern matching, with ring vectors selected to screen for either tingible body macrophages or apoptotic bodies, was subsequently carried out on the differing <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi>-IMAs, with attainment of excellent discriminant classification between the two diagnostic classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi>-IMA construct enables and accelerates high-throughput multicase, multifield based image feature discovery and classification, thus simplifying the development, validation, and comparison of CAD algorithms in settings where the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of diagnostic feature morphologic is a significant factor </plain></SENT>
