<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to analyse the main differential features of patients with primary extranodal FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine patients with primary extranodal FL were identified from a series of 354 patients with FL diagnosed at a single institution and their main clinicobiological features were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (5·6%) had a primary extranodal non-cutaneous FL, and 19 (5·4%) a cutaneous FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BCL2(+) and CD10(+) expression and BCL2/IGHJ@ rearrangement were less frequently observed in cutaneous FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Absence of 'B'-symptoms, early stage, absence of bone marrow involvement and low-risk Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) were more frequent in extranodal FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five-year overall survival (OS) was 100%, 83% and 78% for cutaneous, non-cutaneous and nodal FL, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When stage I patients were analysed separately, no differences were seen in terms of OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, FLIPI was the most important variable to predict outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, extranodal FLs, particularly cutaneous, have particular clinico-biological features, which differentiate them from nodal cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, primary site of the disease is not the main issue to predict outcome </plain></SENT>
