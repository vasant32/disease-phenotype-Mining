<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The unique immunoglobulin idiotype (Id) expressed by each B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is a target for immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vaccination with Id induces humoral and/or cellular anti-Id immune responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical impact of these anti-Id immune responses is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We and others have previously reported that immunoglobulin G Fc receptor (FcgammaR) polymorphisms predict the clinical response of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients to passive anti-CD20 antibody infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested whether anti-Id immune responses or FcgammaR polymorphisms associate with clinical outcome of patients who received Id vaccination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 136 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who had received Id vaccination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The anti-Id immune responses were measured and FcgammaRIIIa and FcgammaRIIa polymorphisms were determined and correlated with clinical outcome for these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients who mounted humoral immune responses had a longer progression-free survival (PFS) than those who did not (8.21 v 3.38 years; P = .018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with FcgammaRIIIa 158 valine/valine (V/V) genotype also had a longer PFS than those with valine/phenylalanine (V/F) or phenylalanine/phenylalanine (F/F) genotypes (V/V, 8.21 v V/F, 3.38 years; P = .004; v F/F, 4.47 years; P = .035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model showed that V/V genotype and humoral immune responses were independent positive predictors for PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study is the first to identify the predictive value of FcgammaR polymorphism on clinical outcome in patients who received active immunotherapy with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> antigen vaccines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results imply that the antibodies induced against a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> antigen are beneficial and that FcgammaR-bearing cells mediate an antitumor effect by killing antibody-coated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
