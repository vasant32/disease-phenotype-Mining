<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, due to the small number of cases, the incidence of t(14;18) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> associated with FL remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we applied chromogenic in situ hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization for t(14;18) on paraffin-embedded tissue from four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> associated with FL cases and 11 HL cases without a history of FL for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>t(14;18) was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the three successfully-tested <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> associated with FL cases and one case without a history of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of t(14;18) was significantly high in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> associated with FL (p = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> Hodgkin's and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells having t(14;18) showed immunoreactivity for BCL2 and were negatively stained for nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), even in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, HRS cells without t(14;18) showed BCL2 and NF-κB immunoreactivity in 33% and 57% of cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was an inverse correlation between t(14;18) and NF-κB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we assume the incidence of t(14;18) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> associated with FL is higher than previously believed and BCL2 expression derived from t(14;18) may play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> associated with FL </plain></SENT>
