<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo>, defined as a body mass index (BMI) over 30 kg m(-2) at five years before diagnosis,, was associated with an increased risk of NHL (OR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The excess was most pronounced for diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.3-2.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetic variants in the leptin (LEP 19G &gt; A, LEP -2548G &gt; A) and leptin receptor genes (LEPR 223Q &gt; R), previously shown to modulate NHL risk, as well as a polymorphism in the energy regulatory gene adiponectin (APM1 276G&gt;T), were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Findings varied with leptin genotype, the risks being decreased with LEP 19AA (OR = 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-1.0) and increased with LEP -2548GA (OR = 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.7) and -2548AA (OR = 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-1.9), particularly for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These genetic findings, which were independent of BMI, were stronger for men than women </plain></SENT>
