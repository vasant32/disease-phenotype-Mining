<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cells from spleens and lymph nodes infiltrated with neoplastic well-differentiated lymphocytes (WDLT) were investigated for the presence of receptors for unsensitized sheep red blood cells, complement (IgM EAC), and antigen-antibody complexes, as well as for the presence of surface immunoglobulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the cells were examined by scanning electron microscopy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The surface markers and ultrastructure of WDLT cells were compared with those of cells obtained from peripheral blood of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Like the CLL populations, most WDLT samples showed a low percentage of unsensitized sheep red blood cell-binding cells and a concomitantly high percentage of IgM EAC-binding cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a substantial number of WDLT cells in several instances showed a lower binding affinity for IgM EAC than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes, as demonstrated by the poor attachment of the IgM EAC reagent to the WDLT cells in suspension and to frozen tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Weak IgM EAC binding capacity was demonstrated in the CLL cells as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>WDLT and CLL cells bound the IgG EA complex only when certain sensitive techniques were applied (pelleting) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A variable percentage of cells with surface immunoglobulins was found among WDLT and DLL populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, accurate counting of surface immunoglobulin-bearing neoplastic cells was very difficult in most cases due to the extremely faint surface fluorescence as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> did not reveal specific changes in WDLT or CLL cells that would permit their identification as neoplastic lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No major differences were found between WDLT and CLL cells and no correlation could be established between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> appearances and surface markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As previously observed with other cell populations, the conditions under which the cells were manipulated before fixation (in particular the environmental temperature) seemed to play a major role in the final <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> appearance of both WDLT and CLL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results of our studies indicate that WDLT cells represent a population of B-cells whose surface properties are very similar to those of circulating CLL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The poor capacity of WDLT cells and CLL cells to bind IGM EAC or to stain with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>-conjugated antihuman immunoglobulin suggests low density or poor affinity of the surface receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In this regard, these neoplastic cells are different from those of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, also of B-cell origin </plain></SENT>
