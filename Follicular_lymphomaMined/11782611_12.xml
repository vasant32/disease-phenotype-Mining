<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although the gastrointestinal tract is the most common site of extranodal non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), primary small intestine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> remain relatively rare, especially localized low-grade follicular B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> do occur at this site, most are high grade and require aggressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report three cases of small intestinal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosed on endoscopic biopsy and review the clinical history, pathologic features, and treatment outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY: A review of the medical records and pathology from three cases of small intestine follicular NHL was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pathology specimens were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues processed for routine microscopic examination, immunohistochemical staining, and molecular analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histologic and immunophenotypical studies were diagnostic of grade 1 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Revised European-American <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> classification/World Health Organization classification) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases expressed bcl-2 protein, and polymerase chain reaction analysis supported the diagnosis in two cases with adequate DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With 23.3 months' median follow-up, one untreated and one treated patient were alive without symptoms; a third untreated patient died of a nonlymphoma cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Isolated indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the small intestine are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Accurate pathologic staging and histologic classification are paramount in delineating treatment options </plain></SENT>
