<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>p63 is a p53-related gene mapping to 3q28 that codes for multiple <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts with (TA-p63) or without (DeltaN-p63) transactivating effects on genes that promote cell differentiation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analysed p63 alterations by immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time RT-PCR and FISH in a series of 45 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> showed immunoreactivity for the p40 antibody, which recognizes only the truncated isoforms of p63, or DeltaN-p63 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity for the 4A4 antibody, which recognizes both the transactivating and the truncated p63 isoforms, was found in 5 +/- 5.5%, 6.85 +/- 4.88% and 33.2 +/- 22.31% of grade I, II and III FL cells, respectively (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases but one had TA-p63 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels higher than non-neoplastic lymphocytes, and that TA-p63 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression correlated significantly (r = 0.9194, p &lt; 0.0001) with the prevalence of p63 immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FISH extra signals for the p63 gene were found in seven (23.3%) of the 30 cases analysed (0/6 grade I, 2/15 grade II and 5/9 grade III; p = 0.01937) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further hybridizations showed a pattern highly suggestive of chromosome 3 polysomy in six cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of these cases also bore extra copies of the p63 and bcl-6 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Co-localization of p63 and IgH signals was found in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No association between the prevalence of p63 immunoreactivity and extra p63 gene signals was detectable when the cases were dichotomized according to a p63 immunoreactivity threshold of 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that TA-p63 is overexpressed in high-grade FL, possibly independent of the occurrence of gene abnormalities, and that it may be involved in the highly complex mechanism of regulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of FL cells </plain></SENT>
