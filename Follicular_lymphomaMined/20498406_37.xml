<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Rearrangement of MYC occurs in a proportion of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), where they may be associated with an adverse clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of MYC translocations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and their prognostic impact in the era of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> plus rituximab (CHOP-R) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred three patients with previously untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, with no evidence of underlying follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, were investigated using immunohistochemistry and interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization for MYC, BCL6, and t(14;18)/BCL2 rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients (median age, 71.1 years; range, 23 to 96 years) were treated when CHOP-R was standard therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and observed for a maximum of 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (OS) at 3 years was 49% (95% CI, 42% to 56%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MYC rearrangements were demonstrated in 35 (14%) of 245 biopsies with data available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 26 (74%) also had a t(14;18), 10 (26%) were BCL6 and MYC rearranged, and seven had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only age, International Prognostic Index, and MYC rearrangement retained prognostic significance in the final model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>OS was significantly worse for patients with rearrangement of MYC (survival probability at 2 years = 0.35 in v 0.61 in the nonrearranged group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of a MYC rearrangement is a strongly adverse prognostic factor in CHOP-R-treated patients and can be used in combination with patients' age and IPI to accurately predict clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, rearrangement of MYC is rarely found as the sole genetic abnormality and the poor prognosis of these patients is likely to reflect a synergistic effect alongside deregulation of BCL6 or BCL2 </plain></SENT>
