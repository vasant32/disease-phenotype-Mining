<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and non-Hodgkin's B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> occasionally occur in the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify whether these different diseases share a common precursor cell, we analyzed the immunoglobulin rearrangements in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells of the classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that developed in the same patient 2 years apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of rearranged immunoglobulin genes was carried out on single Reed-Sternberg cells and on whole tissue DNA extracted from the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PCR products were sequenced and compared with each other and with germ line immunoglobulin variable segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain transcripts were analyzed by radioactive in-situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The same monoclonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangement was found in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The variable region of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes of the Reed-Sternberg and of the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were differently mutated, but six <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> were shared by both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the coding capacity of the immunoglobulin genes was preserved in both neoplastic cell populations, immunoglobulin heavy- (mu) and light- (kappa) chain expression was restricted to the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, except for small amounts of kappa light-chain <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in some Reed-Sternberg cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The neoplastic cells of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that occurred in this patient derived from a common precursor B cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Its differentiation stage could be identified as that of a germinal center B cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, transforming events can be more important than the cell of origin in determining a disease entity </plain></SENT>
