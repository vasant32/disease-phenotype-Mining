<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of radioimmunotherapy (RIT) in recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed 9 patients, 7 with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), 1 with mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>), and 1 with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated with 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan 6 to 140 months after HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent 111In-ibritumomab scintigraphy and were treated 1 week later with standard 14.8 MBq/kg (n = 4) or 11.1 MBq/kg (n = 4) 90Y-ibritumomab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient who had allo-HSCT had reduced activity (70%) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 7 FL patients, we observed complete response (CR) in 2 patients and partial response (PR) in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient with CR relapsed after 15 months; the other persisted 43.5 months after RIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 5 patients with PR, 3 relapsed between 13 and 17 months; 1 persisted until unrelated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 11.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fifth patient with PR received adoptive immunotherapy and improved to metabolic (FDG-PET) CR that persists 45.5 and 41 months after 90Y-ibritumomab and immunotherapy, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> progressed or experienced stabilization (5 months), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six patients had grade 1 to 3 bone marrow (BM) toxicity and recovered within 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients having 90Y-ibritumomab 6, 14, and 24 months after HSCT experienced grade 4 BM toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One of them (RIT 24 months after HSCT) recovered after 3 months, another delayed after 9 months, and the third patient only partially recovered, eventually developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, and was allografted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Radioimmunotherapy after HSCT is an effective rescue therapy in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, BM toxicity may be important; 3 of 8 patients treated with standard 90Y-ibritumomab activity experienced grade 4 BM toxicity, with incomplete recovery 3 months after RIT in 2 patients, both treated early (6 and 14 months) after HSCT </plain></SENT>
