<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results concerning the microenvironmental organization of reactive lymphoid follicles confirmed that the distribution of CD21+ and CD23+ dendritic reticulum cells, vimentin+ fibroblastic reticulum cells, and CD68+ tingible-body macrophages is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> with reference to their immunostaining patterns and topographic localization within the germinal center and mantle zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a close microenvironmental similarity between the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of supposed germinal center or mantle zone origin and their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterparts was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study of the microenvironment of the B-zone small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases, showing the same distribution patterns for the nonlymphoid cells as seen in mantle zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, corroborated the supposed follicular origin of this unusual variant of small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study shows that monoclonal antibodies recognizing CD21, CD23, and CD68 antigens may be valuable additions to vimentin, S-100 protein, laminin, and type IV collagen antibodies for investigating the microenvironmental organization of lymphoid tissues in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic conditions </plain></SENT>
