<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The BIOMED-2 multiplex PCR protocol is a commonly used procedure for assessing B cell clonality in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnostics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> poses a special challenge for PCR-based analyses because of high prevalence of somatic hypermutations in the rearranged immunoglobulin (IG) domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate the BIOMED-2 protocol performance in detection of B cell clonality in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: FFPE samples from 118 patients diagnosed with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the period 1998-2008 were used in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clonality of IG heavy (IGH) and light chains (IGK, IGL) was assessed using a PCR procedure that was optimised for FFPE tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The highest clonal detection rates were 67.8% with the IGH Vн-FR2-Jн assay and 66.1% with the IGK Vκ-Jκ assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clonality was detected in 94.9% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FFPE follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> assays were combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FFPE samples stored for 1-5 years did not perform significantly differently from those stored for 6-11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement of clonality was tested for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lowest score (Cohen's κ value = 0.56) was observed for the IGK Vκ-Jκ clonality assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An improved PCR protocol for detection of clonality in FFPE samples using BIOMED-2 IG primers is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For best performance, a combination of IGH and IGK analyses is recommended </plain></SENT>
