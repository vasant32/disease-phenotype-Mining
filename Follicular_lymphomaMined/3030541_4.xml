<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an effort to obtain low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines for in vitro study, we used Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as a transforming agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T-cells were removed prior to EBV transformation by rosetting with sheep erythrocytes, followed by treatment with anti-T11 monoclonal antibody plus complement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The resulting cell population was cocultured with EBV prepared from tissue culture supernatants of marmoset cell line B95-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Identical immunoglobulin gene rearrangements of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and EBV-transformed cells were the criteria used to determine that the transformed cells were of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA was prepared from both biopsy tissue and EBV cell lines and digested with restriction endonucleases, and Southern blots were prepared by standard methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>B-cells isolated from biopsies of four low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of follicular, small cleaved cell type and one of follicular, mixed cell type were transformed by EBV into rapidly growing in vitro tissue culture lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two of the five transformed cell lines had immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain gene rearrangements which were present in cells from the original <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biopsy, indicating that these EBV-transformed cell lines are of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> origin </plain></SENT>
