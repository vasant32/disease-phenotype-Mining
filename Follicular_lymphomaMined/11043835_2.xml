<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2 proto-oncogene is involved in the development of human follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and also in a number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> such as <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> of prostate, breast, lung and GIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to analyze the role of Bcl-2 expression in cervical intraepithelial squamous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> (CIN) and cervical invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Special attention was given to the association of Bcl-2 expression with the grade of the lesion, proliferative activity (expression of nuclear antigen of proliferative cells - PCNA) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850011,C0850009" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">human papillomavirus</z:e> (HPV) DNA positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined tissue samples obtained from 86 women with varying degrees of cervical disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 and PCNA were investigated using immunohistochemical staining and detection of HPV DNA was performed by hybridization in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased Bcl-2 expression was observed in advanced degrees of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found a strong association between the presence of Bcl-2 in pathological epithelium with both the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and the proliferative activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also observed a significant correlation between the amount of Bcl-2 positive lymphocytes infiltrating the lesions and the degree of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We, therefore, suggest that Bcl-2 expression in these lymphocytes may influence the antiviral or antitumor immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand we did not detect any significant correlation between the Bcl-2 oncoprotein and the presence of HPV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that Bcl-2 may play an important role in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302592" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
