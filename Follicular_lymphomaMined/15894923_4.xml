<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Germinal centers within the lymph node follicles are T-cell-dependent, antigen-driven B-cell proliferations that develop from the rapid clonal expansion of a few <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The end results of this B-cell expansion are memory B cells or plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two morphologic forms of plasma cell can be recognized in the germinal center: classic plasma cells, characterized morphologically by peripherally clumped arrangement of nuclear chromatin, and cells with a nuclear <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> more resembling that of the centrocytes, which the authors have termed "centrocytoid plasma cells." In this study the authors examined the distribution and immunohistochemical characteristics of these two populations of germinal center plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The centrocytoid plasma cells were arranged in a band stretching from the junction of the dark and light zone to the periphery of the germinal centers, while the classic plasma cells were mainly present at the germinal center periphery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both marked with CD38, CD138, and VS38c, recognized markers for plasma cells; however, EMA and CD31 were present only in the classic form of plasma cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proliferation marker Ki67 was present in less than 1% of the cells labeling with CD138 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Others have demonstrated Ki67 in 50% of the cells labeled with Blimp-1, which is consistent with Blimp-1 appearing earlier than CD138 in ontogeny </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD10 is co-expressed with CD138 in about 10% of cells and CD45 with CD138 in about 5% of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Their topographic features, together with the progressive acquisition of plasma cell markers, suggest that the centrocytoid plasma cells may be the precursors of the classic plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of note, both the forms of plasma cell were absent in follicles of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which supports the concept that in this disease, lymphocytes fail to differentiate and mature beyond the centrocyte stage </plain></SENT>
