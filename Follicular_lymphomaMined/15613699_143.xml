<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with indolent and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">Bortezomib</z:chebi> was given at a dose of 1.5 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were required to have received no more than three prior chemotherapy regimens, with at least 1 month since the prior treatment, 3 months from prior rituximab, and 7 days from prior <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>; absolute neutrophil count more than 1,500/microL (500/microL if documented bone marrow involvement); and platelet count more than 50,000/microL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were registered, of whom 24 were assessable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 11 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, three had small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), and two had marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 58%, with one complete remission (CR), one unconfirmed CR (CRu), and four partial remissions (PR) among patients with follicular non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> responses were durable, lasting from 3 to 24+ months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> achieved a CRu, four achieved a PR, and four had stable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> maintained his remission for 19 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both patients with marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> achieved PR lasting 8+ and 11+ months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e> or CLL have yet to respond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall, the drug was well tolerated, with only one grade 4 toxicity (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The most common grade 3 toxicities were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> (n = 14) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> was well tolerated and has significant single-agent activity in patients with certain subtypes of NHL </plain></SENT>
