<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A dendritic staining pattern within germinal centers was present in 25 of 26 routinely processed lymph nodes with reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, dendritic staining with anti-NGFR was present within neoplastic follicles in only three of 28 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Staining of benign, residual germinal centers with anti-NGFR was present in mantle zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a possible role for the NGFR in the maturation and/or activation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> DRCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The loss of NGFR expression in most follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> indicates that DRCs are altered as part of the neoplastic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The possibility that DRCs may play a role in the pathogenesis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is suggested </plain></SENT>
