<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most are diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with frequent dissemination and a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the adult testis has not been well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, a small number of primary testicular follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> have recently been described in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These showed stage 1E disease, a lack of BCL2 gene rearrangement and Bcl-2 protein expression, and a good clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe 5 cases of primary follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the testis and epididymis in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These presented as unilateral testicular masses 12 to 40 mm in diameter and were characterized histologically by small neoplastic follicles in a sclerotic background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neoplastic cells expressed CD10 and Bcl-6, but not Bcl-2 and lacked t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IGH-BCL2 and BCL6 gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four of the five patients were 35 years old or younger, and 4 presented with stage 1EA disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although follow-up is 12 months or less in 2 of the 5 patients, to date each has followed an indolent clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These features are different from those of most adult nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> but are very similar to those of the pediatric primary testicular follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Together, the pediatric and adult cases represent a discrete clinicopathologic entity of t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IGH-BCL2-negative primary follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the testis and epididymis, which typically present as clinically indolent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e> in young males and should be distinguished from the diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> more frequently seen in the testes of older adults </plain></SENT>
