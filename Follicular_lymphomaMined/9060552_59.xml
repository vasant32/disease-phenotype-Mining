<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate prospectively in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and a low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden three therapeutic options: delay of any treatment until clinically meaningful progression, immediate treatment with an oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agent</z:chebi>, or treatment with a biologic response modifier, interferon alfa-2b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Newly diagnosed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients with a low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden (n = 193) were randomly assigned to one of three arms: arm 1, no initial treatment (n = 66); arm 2, prednimustine 200 mg/m2/d for 5 days per month for 18 months (n = 64); or arm 3, interferon alfa 5 MU/d for 3 months then 5 MU three times per week for 15 months (n = 63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical characteristics were similar in the three arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall response rates with prednimustine and interferon alfa were 78% and 70%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall response to therapy, when deferred, was similar at 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up duration of 45 months after randomization, the median freedom-from-treatment (FFT) interval was 24 months in arm 1 and the interval of freedom from treatment failure (FFTF) was 40 months in arm 2 and 35 months in arm 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival time was not reached and the overall survival rate at 5 years was 78% in arm 1, 70% in arm 2, and 84% in arm 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, deferred treatment does not adversely influence survival at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients who progressed within 1 year had a significantly shorter survival duration (median, 48 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Delayed treatment is feasible in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and a low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For patients with early progression, more intensive therapy should be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For others, because delay of treatment until significant clinical progression does not seem to hamper the prognosis or subsequent response to treatment, the long-term toxicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> can be reduced </plain></SENT>
