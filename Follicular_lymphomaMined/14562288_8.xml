<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The histological transformation from a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) to a diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLBL) occurs in 22% to 30% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify specific chromosomal gains/losses associated with transformation of FL to DLBL, in addition to the well-known mechanisms like p53 mutation and protein expression and c-myc translocation and up-regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to meet 2 important conditions for such a comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, we demonstrate that the FL and the DLBL were clonally related, based on identical immunoglobulin gene rearrangements in 5 of the 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Second, we used laser microdissection microscopy to isolate only the neoplastic cells from the initial FL samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that no single chromosomal abnormality seems to be responsible for the transformation of FL to DLBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>P53 protein overexpression was found in 4 and c-myc translocation in 3 of the 6 transformed DLBLs, but not in the initial FL samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional chromosomal abnormalities were detected by comparative genomic hybridization in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 cases when the DLBL was compared with the FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 5 cases with transformation of grade 1 or 2 FL to DLBL, gains at chromosomes 7 (5 of 5 cases), 10p1 (3 of 5 cases), 12 (3 of 5 cases), and 20p13 (2 of 5 cases) and loss at 9q (4 of 5 cases) were the most frequently found abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A gain on chromosome 7p, in combination with a loss on 9q, was found in 4 of the 5 DLBL that transformed from FL grade 1 or 2 </plain></SENT>
