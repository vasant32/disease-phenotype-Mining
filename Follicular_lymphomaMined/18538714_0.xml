<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 71-year-old woman presenting with composite <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (CL) composed of a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and a B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CL is a rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo>, characterized by two distinct morphological and immunophenotypical patterns in the same anatomical site, most frequently of biclonal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This entity must be distinguished from transformation of low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> into high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with differentiation such as follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with marginal differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this context, molecular analysis including immunoglobulin rearrangement, sequencing and FISH analyses is determinant and can be improved by tissue microdissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Routinely, CL must not be misdiagnosed because of its prognosis and treatment implication </plain></SENT>
