<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is expressed on follicular dendritic cells (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi>), and the ICAM-1/LFA-1 pathway is essential for affinity selection of activated B-cells in germinal centers (GC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of ICAM-1 has been studied by immunostaining methods in GC, but not in neoplastic follicles (NF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors studied the expression of ICAM-1 by the avidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-peroxidase complex (ABC) method with frozen sections in GC of reactive nodes (n = 22) and NF of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (n = 19), in comparison with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: GC stained uniformly for ICAM-1, with staining intensity varying little from node to node, and follicular borders were well demarcated from the surroundings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endothelial cells within GC did not stain whereas those outside stained strongly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, NF stained variably from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, and in any given <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Characteristically, follicular borders were not demarcated, and stained areas were difficult to define due to the lack of demarcation, with the exception of large cell type with diffuse areas (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endothelium of intrafollicular vessels stained prominently (12 of 19), and appeared to contribute to the staining intensity of the follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> staining revealed a meshwork pattern in GC which was similar to that of ICAM-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> mesh-work pattern was present in 15 tumors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pattern was remarkably uniform with sharply defined borders, which contrasted starkly to the variable staining and lack of follicular borders in the ICAM-1 stain of the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The staining pattern of follicles for ICAM-1 was similar to that for <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> in reactive nodes, but distinct from the latter in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An appropriate expression of ICAM-1 appears to be essential for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GC, as the alteration of the expression coincides with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> of GC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The altered expression of ICAM-1 may be useful in distinguishing NF from reactive GC </plain></SENT>
