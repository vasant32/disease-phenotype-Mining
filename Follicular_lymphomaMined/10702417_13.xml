<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Clonal evolution</z:e> and histological transformation of FL is frequently associated with the accumulation of secondary genetic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that the BCL-6 gene can be altered by chromosomal rearrangements and by mutations clustering in its 5' noncoding region in a significant fraction of FL and diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the role of the BCL-6 gene alterations in the histological transformation and clonal progression of FL, we analyzed serial biopsy specimens from 12 patients with FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two cases of FL showed no histological alteration in the second biopsy, and 10 cases of FL showed morphological transformation to DLCL in the second biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis was used to detect rearrangement of the BCL-6 gene, polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism and sequence analysis were performed for identification of mutations in the 5' noncoding region of the BCL-6 gene, and immunohistochemical analysis was applied to reveal the BCL-6 protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No BCL-6 gene rearrangement was detected in any of the samples, but a total of 58 mutations were found in the 5' noncoding region of the BCL-6 gene in seven cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In five cases, both the FL and the clonally related FL or DLCL, and in two cases only the DLCL samples were mutated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mutations were identical in multiple biopsy specimens of FL that did not show morphological transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In six patients where FL cells underwent morphological transformation, considerable intraclonal sequence <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was observed, indicating an ongoing type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on the pattern of shared and nonshared mutations, the genealogical relationship of neoplastic clones could be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these cases, the histological transformation of FL was associated with the emergence of a subpopulation marked by new sites of mutations in the BCL-6 5' noncoding sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In three of these six cases, the histological transformation is also associated with the reduced expression of the BCL-6 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that mutation of the 5' noncoding region of the BCL-6 gene developed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> of FL, and at different time points in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> evolution different clonotypes dominate </plain></SENT>
