<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to determine the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHOP) chemotherapy followed by tositumomab/<z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> I-131 tositumomab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1999 to 2000, the Southwest <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group (SWOG) conducted a phase II trial (S9911) to test a novel new regimen consisting of six cycles of CHOP chemotherapy followed 4 to 8 weeks later by tositumomab/<z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> I-131 tositumomab in 90 eligible patients with previously untreated, advanced-stage FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response rate was 91%, including a 69% complete remission (CR) rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up time of 5.1 years, the estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 87%, and the progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 67% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 5-year estimates of OS and PFS were each 23% better (absolute difference) than the corresponding figures for patients treated on previous SWOG protocols with CHOP alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An analysis according to the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index showed that 21% of patients had high-risk features, 44% had intermediate-risk features, and 34% had low-risk features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High-risk patients had worse OS than lower risk patients (P = .05), but differences in PFS were not statistically significant (P = .21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serial monitoring of the t(14;18) translocation in bone marrow by polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that 32 of 38 informative patients obtained molecular CRs, including seven patients (18%) after CHOP and 24 additional patients (63%) after tositumomab/<z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> I-131 tositumomab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(The timing of conversion of one patient was unclear.) CONCLUSION: A prospective, phase III, randomized Intergroup Trial is currently underway comparing the efficacy of the promising CHOP + tositumomab/<z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> I-131 tositumomab regimen with the efficacy of CHOP + rituximab </plain></SENT>
