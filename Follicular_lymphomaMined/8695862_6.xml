<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Deletion of the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q) is one of the most common chromosomal alterations in human B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conventional cytogenetic banding analysis and loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) studies have detected several common regions of deletion ranging across the entire long arm (6q), with no defined recurrent breakpoint yet identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe here a strategy combining chromosome microdissection and fluorescence in situ hybridization (Micro-FISH) to determine a minimal region of deletion along chromosome 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven clinical cases and one cell line of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> containing a t(14;18) and one case of diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, also with a t(14;18), were used for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> nine cases had previously defined abnormalities of chromosome 6 determined by cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of chromosome dissection were unexpected and in contrast to the suggestion of disparate breakpoints by conventional chromosome banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specifically, Micro-FISH analysis provided evidence for a common breakpoint at 6q11 in seven of nine cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After Micro-FISH analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the presumed simple deletions of chromosome 6 were carefully reanalyzed and shown to actually represent either nonreciprocal translocations (three cases), interstitial deletions (five cases), or isochromosome (one case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The recurrent proximal breakpoint (6q11) was detected in seven of nine cases, with the minimal region of deletion encompassing 6q11 to 6q21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By analogy to other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> systems, the identification of recurring breakpoints within 6q11 may suggest that a gene(s) important to the genesis or progression of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> can be localized to this band region </plain></SENT>
