<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for the translocation products suffers from low analytic specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a result, either nested PCR or probe hybridization is required to aid in the identification of the specific translocation products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These added procedures are undesirable in clinical laboratories because nested procedures increase the possibility of contamination and probe hybridization increases assay turnaround time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To simplify the BCL2-IGH assay procedure, we attempted to eliminate the nonspecific PCR products by optimizing the annealing temperatures of the PCR assays using a gradient thermocycler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We showed that gradually increasing the annealing temperature from 55 degrees C to 67 degrees C significantly enhanced the intensity of the specific PCR products while eliminating the nonspecific ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We compared the simplified procedure with a PCR-probe hybridization method on 68 patient specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The simplified procedure had increased analytic and diagnostic specificities with comparable sensitivities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With significantly improved analytic specificity, one round of PCR is sufficient to detect the BCL2-IGH gene rearrangements without further confirmation </plain></SENT>
