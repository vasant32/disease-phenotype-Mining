<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its indolent nature even in advanced stages and the failure of conservative or aggressive treatments to achieve a cure have questioned the need for immediate treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who had minimal or no treatment were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median age was 44 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Staging was: I (4), III (6) and IV (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight were confirmed to have follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of whom six did not receive treatment at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four of these patients remain in remission after 14 to 30 years of follow-up and the other two have relapsed after 10 and 13 years of follow-up, respectively </plain></SENT>
