<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 28 FL-GI patients, 135 FL-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> patients and 70 MALT-GI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In FL-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> the clinical stage III-IV was 83%, while in FL-GIs clinical stage I-II was 68% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In MALT-GIs clinical stage I-II was 87% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall survival was significantly better in MALT-GI patients than in FL-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> FL-GI patients were alive at the time of evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regarding the histological grade (WHO), grade 1 was 81% in FL-GI, whereas in FL-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> grade 2 was 28% and grade 3 was 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index was low in 61% of FL-GIs, while in FL-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> it was equally distributed to low, intermediate and high, suggesting that the prognosis is better in FL-GIs than in FL-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinicopathological studies revealed the FL-GI has intermediate characteristics between FL-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> and MALT-GI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We recommend a 'watch-and-wait' policy or chemotherapy with rituximab for the therapy of FL-GIs because the lesions are often located in broader areas from the lower duodenum to the small intestine </plain></SENT>
