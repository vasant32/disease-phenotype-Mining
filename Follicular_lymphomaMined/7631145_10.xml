<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A biopsy specimen from a patient with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was divided into two fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from one fragment and a 1.2 kb region of the functional heavy chain (IgH) gene was amplified, cloned and sequenced (eight clones) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From the other fragment a cell line (HF-1) was started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The IgH gene region was amplified from the cell line, and sequenced without cloning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The nine sequences obtained could be arranged into a genealogical tree where the individual sequences differed from the deduced ancestor by 16-29 single nucleotide changes, some also by an insertion and/or a deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is apparent that the sequence alterations were caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> during the growth of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The comparison of the sequences with two published (allelic) germline sequences of the human JH region showed approximately 20% non-homology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The differences included five additional multinucleotide insertion/deletion changes, the longest of them a 101-nucleotide insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two long insertions were homologous to the adjacent germline sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose that most of the changes observed, including long deletions and insertions, represent or are linked to somatic hypermutation events of the Ig gene type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although in a few cases large deletions and insertions (&gt; 2 bp) have been found in mutated immunoglobulin genes, our results, for the first time, firmly link these deletions/insertions to somatic hypermutations; their frequency was found to be 2.2% of the observed mutational events in the non-translated gene regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>HF-1 is the first follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line successfully established from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> known to have hypermutated its Ig genes during the malignant growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is a candidate cell line to be studied for its ability to generate mutations of B cell type in cell cultures </plain></SENT>
