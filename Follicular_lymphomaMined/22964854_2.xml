<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The morphological differentiation between germinal center-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (GC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and high-grade (grade 3) FL could be challenging; the accurate sub-classification of large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is mandatory in order to select the most appropriate among the new-targeted therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent expression profiling studies reported microRNAs (miRNAs) (and miR-17-92 cluster, in particular) as useful tools in differentiating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, these preliminary results are based on cell line-derived data or did not consider grade 3 FL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate this point, 36 cases of GC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and 18 cases of grade 3 non-transforming FL were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> diagnoses were based on the World Health Organization criteria and were confirmed by clinical, histological, and immunohistochemical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six members of the miR-17-92 cluster (ie, miR-18b, miR-19b, miR-20a, miR-92, miR-93, and miR-106a) and two control miRNAs (ie, miR-150 and miR-210) were quantified by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the considered miR-17-92 cluster miRNAs were significantly overexpressed in GC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, being miR-20a and miR-106a the most dysregulated (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) analysis was used to find the optimal cut-off in distinguishing the two histotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ROC estimated thresholds for miR-18b, miR-19b, miR-20a, miR-92, and miR-106a displayed a sensitivity level higher than 0.80 in achieving the GC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The classification tree built on the six thresholds allowed the correct identification of 35/36 GC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (97.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Profiling the miR-17-92 cluster is a promising investigative method for differentiating GC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> from high-grade FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Subject to the validation of these findings in further larger studies; miR-17-92 cluster could represent a reliable, standardizable diagnostic tool for the sub-classification of large B-cell lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
