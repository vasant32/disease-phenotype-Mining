<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathological data of 101 PGI-NHL patients admitted in our hospital in the past 15 years were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that 101 patients with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26345">PGI</z:chebi>-NHL accounted for 14.49% of NHL in the same period, there were 64 males, 37 females, the range of ages was from 18 to 87 years old, median age was 61 years old; in disease distribution, the stomach <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26345">PGI</z:chebi>-NHL accounted for 58.42%, intestine <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26345">PGI</z:chebi>-NHL accounted for 39.60%, multiple GI involvements (MGI) accounted for 1.98%; in pathological type, diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) accounted for 66.34%, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> accounted for 17.82%, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) accounted for 3.96%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002242'>enteropathy</z:hpo>-associated T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (EATL) accounted for 7.92%, extra-nodal nasal type NK/T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> accounted for 1.98%, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) accounted for 0.99%, small lymphocyte <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>) accounted for 0.99% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty-nine out of 101 patients were followed up (49 cases live, 40 cases dead), data of the 12 patients were lost; the median survival time was 29 months (1 - 173) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The three-year OS and five-year OS were 58.4% and 52.6% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis revealed that the factors affecting OS included sex (P = 0.004), lesion site (P = 0.002), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size (P = 0.011), clinical Lugano staging for gastrointestinal non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (P = 0.003), IPI score (P = 0.000), pathological <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> (P = 0.001), and pathological type (P = 0.006), their differences were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that clinical Lugano staging for gastrointestinal non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, IPI score, pathological type were independent prognostic risk factors affecting OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that clinical Lugano staging for gastrointestinal non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, IPI score and pathological type are independent risk factors affecting OS </plain></SENT>
