<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">Gemcitabine</z:chebi> is an analogue of deoxycytidine with activity against several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to elucidate the mechanisms by which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells become resistant to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi>, we developed the resistant subline RL-G from the human follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line RL-7 by prolonged exposure of parental cells to increasing concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In vitro, the IC50 increased from 0.015 microM in parental RL-7 cells to 25 microM in the resistant variant, RL-G </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Xenografts of both cell lines developed in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice were treated with repeated injections of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Under conditions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi> treatment which totally inhibited the development of RL-7 tumors, RL-G derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> grew similarly to those of untreated animals, demonstrating the in vivo resistance of RL-G cells to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HPLC experiments showed that RL-G cells accumulated and incorporated less <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi> metabolites into DNA and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> than RL-7 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">Gemcitabine</z:chebi> induced an S-phase arrest in RL-7 cells but not in RL-G cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi> induced a higher degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in RL-7 than in RL-G cells, with poly-(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase cleavage in RL-7 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No modifications of Bcl-2 nor of Bax expression were observed in RL-7 or RL-G cells exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These alterations were associated with the absence of the deoxycytidine kinase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression observed by quantitative RT-PCR in RL-G cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PCR amplification of d√©soxycytidine kinase gene exons showed a partial deletion of the dCK gene in RL-G cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that partial deletion of the dCK gene observed after selection in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi> is involved with resistance to this agent both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
