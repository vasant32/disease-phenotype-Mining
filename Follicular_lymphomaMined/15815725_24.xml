<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bcl2, Bcl6 and CD10 are phenotypic markers of FL while the Bcl2 t(14;18) and Bcl6 t(3q27) gene translocations are common genetic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, to date, there has been no integrated analysis based on phenotype, grade and genotype from large numbers of FL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We graded 261 cases of FL and determined their phenotypes and gene alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to the antigen markers and gene alterations of 147 cases, we classified FL into typical and the others types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The typical group, which includes 69% cases of FL, is characterized by low histological grade (grade 1, 2), coexpression of BCL2 and CD10 and Bcl2 gene translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rest comprises a small part of low-grade FL without Bcl2 gene translocation and high-grade (grade 3a, 3b) FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These FLs include some <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disease entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They are characterized by high histological grade (87%), no definite expression of BCL2 or CD10 and several kinds of gene aberrances including Bcl2 translocation, Bcl6 translocation, Bcl2 amplification or other unknown gene abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that typical FL presents a homogeneous disease entity whereas the rest comprises <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> diseases entities </plain></SENT>
