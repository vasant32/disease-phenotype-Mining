<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The randomly selected D gene segment of a given VDJ complex can potentially be found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three possible reading frames (RFs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the distribution of D gene RF in 'immature' and 'mature' B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (BCLD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the clonotypic VDJ junctional sequences of our previously reported cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), as well as bcl-2/IgH junctions with recognized D elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A marked under-representation of RF1 was observed, with almost equal usage of RF2 and RF3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A literature search for VDJ published sequences in various BCLD identified a similar pattern of D gene RF usage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM), with marked predilection for RFs 2 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (B-CLL), the pattern of D-RF was 25% for RF1, 46% for RF2 and 29% for RF3, while in B cell precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (precursor-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three RFs were used with similar frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The marked under-representation of RF1 in FL and MM clonogenic rearranged D genes suggests selection on the basis of antigenic properties, possibly due to constraints in forming a flexible loop within CDR3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the more even distribution of D-RF usage in B-CLL and precursor-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> suggests that, for these disorders, transformation of a immature type B cell repertoire has occurred </plain></SENT>
