<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: High-resolution (1)H NMR spectra was obtained from fresh samples of lymph node biopsies obtained consecutively at one center (14 FL and 17 DLBCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Spectra were processed using pattern-recognition methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Discriminant models were able to differentiate between the two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types with a 86% sensitivity and a 76% specificity; the metabolites that most contributed to the discrimination were a relative increase of alanine in the case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and a relative increase of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Metabolic models had a significant but weak correlation with Ki67 expression (r(2)=0.42; p=0.002) CONCLUSIONS: We have proved that it is possible to differentiate between FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> based on their NMR metabolic profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This approach may potentially be applicable as a noninvasive tool for diagnostic and treatment follow-up in the clinical setting using conventional magnetic resonance systems </plain></SENT>
