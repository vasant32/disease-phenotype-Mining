<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective case series of 13 patients who underwent CyberKnife radiosurgery was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen eyes of 13 patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The tissue location of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was orbit (7 eyes), conjunctiva (3 eyes), choroid (2 eyes), and retina (2 eyes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> type was classified as extranodal marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 7 eyes (50%), diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 3 eyes (21%), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 2 eyes (14%), and benign reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> in 2 eyes (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean treatment dose was 1718 centigrays (cGy) (range, 1350-2250 cGy) given over a mean of 5 days (range, 3-5 days) with a mean dose rate of 320 cGy per fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resolution without local recurrence over a mean follow-up of 23 months was documented in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Radiation-associated adverse effects included mild dry eye in 2 patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> in 1 patient with conjunctival <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no radiation <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1275499" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papillopathy</z:e>, and visual acuity was preserved or improved in 13 eyes and decreased in 1 eye due to the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CyberKnife radiosurgery is a well-tolerated technique for the treatment of intraocular and periocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, allowing for local resolution of the lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An important benefit is that treatment was completed over 5 days </plain></SENT>
