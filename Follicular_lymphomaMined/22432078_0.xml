<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of B-non Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHLs) is based on clinical, morphological and immunohistochemi-cal features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in up to 10-15% of cases, analysis of immunoglobulin heavy (IGH) or light (IGK/IGL) chains genes is required to discriminate between malignant and reactive lymphoid proliferations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the feasibility and efficiency of IGK analysis in the routine diagnostic of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (B-LD) when applied to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clonality patterns were studied in 59 B-LD using the BIOMED-2 protocol for IGK assays, after failure of the IGH assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PCR products were evaluated by both heterodu-plex and GeneScan analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IGK analysis was technically successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, it supported the histopa-thological suspicion in 52/59 cases (88%), the sensitivity and specificity being 83% and 80%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, positive and negative predictive values were 95% and 50%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, among various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes, marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> most frequently required IGK analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, IGK study according to the BIOMED-2 protocol resulted feasible and extremely useful in supporting challenging diagnosis of B-LD even if applied on FFPE samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, when NHL is suspected, negative results at IGH analysis should not be considered as conclusive and further investigation of IGK is appropriate </plain></SENT>
