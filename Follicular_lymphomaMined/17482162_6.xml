<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The main differential diagnosis for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL, or in situ localization of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) is <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this differentiation is quite challenging when the initial presentation of FL is in one lymph node and such a lymph node is only partially involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In other words, only a few lymphomatous follicles are present in an otherwise nodal reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The use of FISH on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue as an adjunct to routine histomorphological and immunohistochemical evaluation is valuable for reaching an initial diagnosis of in situ follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in a lymph node which shows predominantly reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this report, we describe our experience in rendering such an initial diagnosis of in situ FL in an apparently healthy individual who has a single persistently enlarged lymph node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The recognition of in situ FL is of utmost importance because it is associated with localized early stage disease (stage I), which according to standard regimens is amenable to local radiation therapy with a good chance for inducing remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such case reported in the English literature using innovative FISH technology on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue in conjunction with other routine histological modalities to produce an initial diagnosis of in situ follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
