<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported a positive association among body mass index, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the leptin and leptin receptor genes that are involved in body weight regulation, and non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms in the ghrelin (GHRL) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) genes were examined in the same population-based case-control study of NHL to further explore the role of genes involved in energy homeostasis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in susceptibility to NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ghrelin is an orexigenic hormone that induces NPY release and inhibits proinflammatory cytokines via its antagonistic relationship with leptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NPY is a potent appetite stimulator controlled by ghrelin and leptin and also acts as a mediator of immune function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA from 458 cases and 812 controls was genotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among genotyped GHRL SNPs, the variant allele for GHRL -4427G&gt;A was inversely associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL [odds ratios (OR), 0.78; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.59-1.0] and more specifically with diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL; homozygous variant: OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.13-0.74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another SNP, GHRL 5179A&gt;G, decreased the risk of DLCL (homozygous variant: OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.10-1.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NPY -485T&gt;C, 1258G&gt;A, and 5671C&gt;T were in total linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0.99) and the homozygous variants were associated with an increased risk of NHL in NPY SNPs -485T&gt;C (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.5), 1258G&gt;A (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.5), and 5671C&gt;T (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3-2.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When stratified by subtype, the variant allele for NPY 1128T&gt;C was positively associated with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1-4.9) as were homozygous variants for NPY SNPs -485T&gt;C (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.4), 1258G&gt;A (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.5), and 5671C&gt;T (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-3.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results add further support for the hypothesis that SNPs in energy-regulating genes affect risk of NHL </plain></SENT>
