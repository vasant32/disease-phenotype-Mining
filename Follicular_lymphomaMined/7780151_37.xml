<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical usefulness of histologic grading in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is controversial and is further compromised by the subjective nature and poor reproducibility of most systems in current use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we decided to objectively evaluate the importance of cellular proliferation in FL, along with the current grading systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 106 patients with FL who were uniformly staged and aggressively treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A proliferative index (PI) was determined quantitatively using an automated image analyzer and a new Ki-67 antibody that stains archival paraffin tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cases were also subclassified according to the Berard, Rappaport, Luke-Collins, and Jaffe methods, and survival analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with a low PI (&lt; 40%) had a significantly longer overall survival (OS) than those with a high PI (&gt; or = 40%), but the PI did not predict failure-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean PI correlated well with the subgroups in each of the various classifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four of the classification methods were predictive of OS, but only the Berard method appeared to predict <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> and suggest that a proportion of patients with FL may be curable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, histologic classification was the only independent predictor of OS (Berard method: relative risk, 3.1) and the International Prognostic Index was the only independent predictor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> (relative risk, 2.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the Berard method for grading of FL is clinically useful and, along with the International Prognostic Index, should be included in future clinical studies of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The measurement of cellular proliferation does not appear to add additional useful information in FL </plain></SENT>
