<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Primary follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the testis in childhood is rare with only 6 cases previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present 3 additional cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We extensively analyzed primary follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the testis in 3 boys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were obtained by reviewing patient charts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients were 4, 5 and 11 years old, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients presented with painless unilateral testicular enlargement and 1 presented with unilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0003623'>hydrocele</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Laboratory findings were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Radical orchiectomy was done in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The excised testes were partially or completely replaced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases the features were those of follicular, large cell-type malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases were CD20 and CDw75 positive, focally CD23 positive and bcl-2 negative, while in 2 they were CD10 positive and bcl-6 positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surface Ig was absent in the 2 cases studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Karyotyping in 1 case showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Staging revealed no evidence of extratesticular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent combination chemotherapy and were in complete remission 7 to 59 months after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We present 3 cases of pediatric primary follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the testis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Pathological findings and clinical features were similar to those in the 6 previously reported cases and suggest that primary pediatric testicular follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> may represent unique subset of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with a particularly good prognosis </plain></SENT>
