<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ancillary studies often are required for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is characterized by a monoclonal B-cell proliferation with coexpression of CD19/CD10 and a t(14;18)(q32;q21) reciprocal translocation, resulting in the immunoglobulin heavy chain/BCL-2 fusion gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These features also can be found, with much lower frequency, in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) of follicle center cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The objective of the current study was to compare the accuracy in detecting FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> of follicle center cell origin by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) versus flow cytometry immunophenotyping (FCM) on FNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Concurrent testing by FISH for t(14;18)(q32;q21) and FCM was performed on 84 FNAs, including 40 FLs and 44 non-FLs (de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e>, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLLs</z:e>/CLLs], small B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasias</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The final diagnosis was rendered based on the combined information from cytomorphology, FCM, FISH, immunocytochemical staining for Ki-67, monoclonality for kappa and lambda light chains, and, if available, corresponding tissue biopsy, cytogenetic analysis, and polymerase chain reaction analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 40 FLs, FISH produced positive results for the t(14;18) translocation in 85.0%, negative results in 7.5%, and insufficient results in 7.5%; whereas, with FCM, 75% of cases exhibited a CD19-positive (CD19+)/CD10+ population (28 monoclonal, 2 nonclonal), 12.5% of cases exhibited a CD19+/CD10-negative population (3 monoclonal, 2 nonclonal), and 12.5% of cases were insufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of nonclonal results from FCM and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the insufficient results from FCM analysis exhibited unequivocal t(14;18) translocation by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the three negative results and the three insufficient results from FISH were monoclonal and CD19+/CD10+ on FCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results from FISH and FCM were concordant in 75% cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of 44 non-FLs, FISH produced positive results for the t(14;18) translocation in 5 DLBCLs and 2 SLLs/CLLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The latter showed single fusion signals just above the cutoff level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases in the non-FL group that failed to show clonality or had insufficient results from FCM were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Among 17 DLBCLs, FISH detected a t(14;18) translocation in 29.4%, whereas FCM demonstrated a CD19+/CD10+ population in 23.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: I-FISH for the t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation provided high overall accuracy in detecting FLs on FNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This test can be used for diagnosing or monitoring FL on FNAs when cellularity is limited or when FCM results are noncontributory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>For detecting a follicle center cell origin in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e>, I-FISH for the t(14;18) translocation appeared to be slightly more sensitive than FCM for the CD19+/CD10+ immunophenotype </plain></SENT>
