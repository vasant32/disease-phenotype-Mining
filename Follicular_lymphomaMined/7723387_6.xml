<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients entered the program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> fulfilled at least one of the following criteria at diagnosis: a bulky <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> &gt; 7 cm; three or more <z:mp ids='MP_0000702'>adenopathies</z:mp> &gt; 3 cm; massive pleural or peritoneal effusion; massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>; B symptoms; platelet count &lt; 100 x 10(9)/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients had bone marrow involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients received ACVBP, and eight CVP as front-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one (62%) patients achieved MD status, 18 reached intensification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 4 years, the time to treatment failure is 55 +/- 9%, and the probability of persisting remission is 75 +/- 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparison by intention to treat of the 26 patients who received ACVBP as front-line therapy to 14 historical high-risk LGFL similarly treated in our institution without intensification, showed better results for the intensified group (P = 0.04 for both probability of persisting remission and time to treatment failure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that early intensification using marrow purged with mafosfamide is a therapeutic option which may bring benefit to patients with high-risk LGFL </plain></SENT>
