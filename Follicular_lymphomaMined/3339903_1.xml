<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first was documented in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cells analyzed, while the second was present in 20% of the metaphases from the first biopsy and in 100% from the second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the t(2;8) translocation arose as a secondary karyotypic change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, although immunological characterization of the neoplastic cells disclosed a monoclonal B cell population that expressed immunoglobulin kappa light chains, as usually found in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with t(2;8) translocation, Southern blot analysis provided evidence of rearrangement in only one kappa chain allele </plain></SENT>
