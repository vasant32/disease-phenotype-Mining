<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effects of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) on the proliferative response of human B cells to the low molecular weight B cell growth factor (BCGF) have been investigated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found that TGF-beta, at picomolar concentrations, strongly inhibited the BCGF-induced proliferation of anti-mu chain or Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I-activated human B cells and also of a BCGF-dependent cell line derived from a human lymphocytic nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This inhibitory effect was detected in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and serum-free culture conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The suppression was greatly reduced when TGF-beta was added to the culture one day after BCGF and could be reverted by removing TGF-beta from the culture medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since TGF-beta has been detected in supernatants from activated T cells, this factor may represent an important regulatory molecule in the feedback control of B cell activation </plain></SENT>
