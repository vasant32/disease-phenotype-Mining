<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The nuclear enzyme poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase (PADPRP) is thought to play a role in DNA recombination, replication, and repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In view of the implication of these processes in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp>, and based on preliminary evidence which indicated the presence of an extraneous polymorphic restriction fragment for murine PADPRP loci in strains of mice susceptible to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo>, we investigated correlations between the restriction fragment length polymorphism of the PADPRP gene(s) and human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No increase in the frequency of polymorphisms on chromosome 1 (containing the active gene) or on chromosome 14 (a pseudogene) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of PADPRP sequences on chromosome 13 (either a processed pseudogene or a gene with extensive identity to PADPRP) revealed that of 19 DNA samples derived from endemic Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> contained at least one copy of a rare allele (B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simple two-allele (A/B) polymorphisms in this PADPRP-like locus were identified by digestion with a number of restriction enzymes including HindIII, PstI, KpnI, and MspI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These restriction fragment length polymorphisms always segregated together, suggesting that they identify a deletion within or close to the PADPRP sequences on chromosome 13, which we mapped precisely to 13q33-qter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based upon family studies the A and B alleles were shown to be transferred in a Mendelian codominant fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, this probe was used as a linkage marker to study the frequency of this deletion in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> including B-cell follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, small cell <z:mp ids='MP_0008714'>lung carcinomas</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinomas</z:hpo>, and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In noncancer control populations, the frequency of this deletion was 3-fold higher among Blacks as compared to Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When DNA from various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> was compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> DNA from racially appropriate noncancer controls, the frequency of this deletion was still 2- to 3-fold higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Matched samples provided instances of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific loss of heterozygosity but also revealed that the predominant source of this deletion is the germ line, suggesting that the chromosome 13 region neighboring the PADPRP locus may harbor a gene whose loss may predispose individuals to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
