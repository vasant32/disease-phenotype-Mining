<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that the 12q12-14 region was mainly amplified in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> cases but not in their FL counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined the DNA copy number and protein expression profiles for CDK2, CDK4 and GADD153, three genes that map to 12q12-14, in a set of 44 paired FL/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> samples from 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The concordant amplification of these genes occurred in seven of 22 (32%) of FL cases, compared with 15 of 22 (68%) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the protein level, 15 of 22 of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> samples (68%) showed strong staining for the CDK2 protein, compared with five of 21 of FL samples (24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> samples (16/22, 72%) expressed the CDK4 protein, whereas the majority of the FL samples (12/21, 57%) showed no expression of this protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Except for one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> case, no expression of the GADD153 protein could be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The deregulation of the CDK2 and CDK4 genes at the genetic and protein levels suggest a functional role for these genes in the transformation process and could potentially provide targets for prognostic tests or therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
