<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>De novo <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> are found inserted in most breakpoints and have been thus far interpreted as nontemplated N region additions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we have analyzed both direct (BCL-2/J(H)) and reciprocal (D(H)/BCL-2) breakpoints derived from 40 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, we found that more than 30% of the breakpoint junctions contain a novel type of templated nucleotide insertions, consisting of short copies of the surrounding BCL-2, D(H), and J(H) sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The features of these templated <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi>, including multiplicity of copies for 1 template and the occurrence of mismatches in the copies, suggest the presence of a short-patch DNA synthesis, templated and error-prone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, our analysis clearly shows that t(14;18) occurs during a very restricted window of B-cell differentiation and involves 2 distinct mechanisms: V(D)J recombination, mediating the breaks on chromosome 14 during an attempted secondary D(H) to J(H) rearrangement, and an additional unidentified mechanism creating the initial breaks on chromosome 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Altogether, these data suggest that the t(14;18) translocation is a more complex process than previously thought, involving the interaction and/or subversion of V(D)J recombination with multiple enzymatic machineries </plain></SENT>
