<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Understanding the relationship between neoplastic cells and the immune microenvironment should facilitate the design of improved immunotherapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we identify impaired T-cell immunologic synapse formation as an active immunosuppressive mechanism in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found a significant reduction in formation of the F-actin immune synapse in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-infiltrating T cells (P &lt; .01) from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients compared with age-matched healthy donor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood T cells exhibited this defect only in patients with leukemic-phase disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we demonstrate that this T-cell defect is induced after short-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell contact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 24-hour coculture with FL cells, previously healthy T cells showed suppressed recruitment of critical signaling proteins to the synapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrate repair of this defect after treatment of both FL cells and T cells with the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tissue microarray analysis identified reduced expression of the T-cell synapse signature proteins, including the cytolytic effector molecule Rab27A associated with poor prognosis, in addition to <z:mp ids='MP_0005018'>reduced T-cell numbers</z:mp> and activity with disease transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results highlight the importance of identifying biomarkers and immunotherapeutic treatments for repairing T-cell responses in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
