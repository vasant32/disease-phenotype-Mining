<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously described the vaccination of 4 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> using dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-derived Id protein and now report on 35 patients treated using this approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 10 initial patients with measurable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 8 mounted T-cell proliferative anti-Id responses, and 4 had clinical responses--2 complete responses (CRs) (progression-free [PF] for 44 and 57 months after vaccination), 1 partial response (PR) (PF for 12 months), and 1 molecular response (PF for 75+ months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, 25 additional patients were vaccinated after first chemotherapy, and 15 of 23 (65%) who completed the vaccination schedule mounted T-cell or humoral anti-Id responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Induction of high-titer immunoglobulin G anti-Id antibodies required coupling of Id to the immunogenic carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Id-KLH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These antibodies could bind to and induce tyrosine phosphorylation in autologous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 18 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumor</z:e> at the time of vaccination, 4 (22%) had <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp>, and 16 of 23 patients (70%) remain without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> at a median of 43 months after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six patients with disease progression after primary DC vaccination received booster injections of Id-KLH protein, and <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> was observed in 3 of them (2 CRs and 1 PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that Id-pulsed DC vaccination can induce T-cell and humoral anti-Id immune responses and durable <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequent boosting with Id-KLH can lead to <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> despite apparent resistance to the primary DC vaccine </plain></SENT>
