<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the diagnostic value of BIOMED-2 IGK assays and investigated the cause of IGH PCR failure in 77 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the full set of BIOMED-2 reactions, clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements were detected in 74 (96%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clonality detection rate was 86% by two IGK reactions but only 68% by five IGH reactions (P &lt; 0·001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of the clonal PCR products showed significantly fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in the rearranged IGKV (9/27 cases, 33%, mean mutation rate 0·5%) than IGHV (17/17 cases, 100%, rate 11·0%) (P &lt; 0·01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> IGHV-IGHJ PCR failures occurred in cases with at least one mutation at the corresponding IGHV primer binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>t(14:18)(q32:q21)/IGH-BCL2 was detected in 50 of 71 (70%) cases and the presence of the translocation was not associated with the poor performance of IGH assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that BIOMED-2 IGK assays are significantly more sensitive than IGH assays in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> due to the fact that the rearranged IGKV is less frequently targeted by somatic hypermutation than IGHV, and therefore, are essential in routine clonality analysis of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
