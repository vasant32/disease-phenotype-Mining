<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2 gene is rearranged in most cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the breakpoint clusters into two specific regions: mbr and mcr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rearrangements to immunoglobulin heavy chain genes (IgH) result in a deregulation of the gene and increased transcription of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for the bcl-2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (CLL) expression of bcl-2 protein is increased but rearrangement of the gene can be found only in a minority of cases: commonly a variant translocation with a breakpoint region located 5' of the bcl-2 gene (vcr) with preferential rearrangement to immunoglobulin light chain genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have analysed breakpoints in mbr and vcr in malignant cells from 96 patients with B-CLL, 45 with hairy cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (HCL) and 41 with high- and low-grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vcr rearrangements were observed in nine patients (12%) with B-CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients had co-migration of rearranged bcl-2 bands to kappa genes and two patients to IgH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic abnormalities involving 18q21, the site of the bcl-2 gene, was found in two cases only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In several cases with bcl-2 gene rearrangement chromosomal aberrations not including 18q21 were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In six patients (two B-CLL, one follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytoma</z:e> and two high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>), breakpoints in both vcr and mbr were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In HCL a rearrangement in the vcr region was found in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 protein immunostaining of B-CLL showed intense bcl-2 expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases and no correlation was found between gene rearrangement and protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our study confirms that breakpoints in the bcl-2 gene commonly cluster to the vcr region in B-CLL, but in most cases over-expression of bcl-2 protein has to be explained by other mechanisms than bcl-2 gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We also report that simultaneous breakpoints in mbr and vcr is a recurrent phenomenon in B-CLL and in other high- and low-grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
