<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In four out of 18 metaphases both copies of chromosome 7 were situated close to one another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, two signals for chromosome 1 were seen in 94% of interphases, consistent with observations on metaphases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest chromosome-specific somatic pairing, the functional significance of which is at present unknown, and reinforce previous evidence suggesting that care should be taken in the interpretation of interphase signal numbers using centromeric probes in neoplastic as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> material </plain></SENT>
