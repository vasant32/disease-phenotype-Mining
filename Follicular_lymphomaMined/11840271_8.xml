<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>T(14;18) chromosomal translocation is assumed to result from illegitimate rearrangement between the BCL2 proto-oncogene and the IGH locus during the D(H) to J(H) joining phase of V(D)J recombination in early B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the breakpoint junctions suggests that translocation derives from the fusion between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> V(D)J recombination intermediates at the IGH locus and non-V(D)J-mediated broken-ends at the BCL2 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>So far, BCL2 broken-ends have only been observed fused to coding-ends, raising questions concerning the molecular constraints of the illegitimate joining process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a combination of genome walking and long-range PCR assays, we describe in this report that in 4.5% (2/44) of the t(14;18), one of the BCL2 broken-ends is fused to a signal-end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The formation of these J(H)RSS/BCL2 junctions provides direct evidence that BCL2 broken-ends are capable of joining to both products of V(D)J recombination, suggesting their presence in the RAG-mediated post-cleavage complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, junctions generated by this alternative end-joining do not involve deletion of the chromosome 14 intervening sequences generally lost in the standard translocation, providing a unique opportunity to investigate the rearrangement status of this region in the translocated IGH allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both cases, a DJ(H) rearrangement could be detected 5' of the J(H)-RSS/BCL2 junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings, together with the previously reported bias towards the most external D(H) and J(H) segments in standard breakpoints, strongly suggest that t(14;18) preferentially occurs during an attempted secondary D(H) to J(H) rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This unusual and restricted window of differentiation opens intriguing questions concerning the etiology of the translocation </plain></SENT>
