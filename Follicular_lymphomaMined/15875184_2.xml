<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The relative incidence of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) compared with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL) is low in Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may be due to a lower incidence of t(14;18)-mediated disease, a rapid transformation of FL to DLCL, or a lower incidence of FL-prone genetic polymorphisms (e.g., bcl-6 G397C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a conventional and long-distance polymerase chain reaction technique, we showed that 93% (43/46) of Chinese FL cases are t(14;18) related and are molecularly indistinguishable from Caucasian cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The translocation was uncommonly found in Chinese DLCL cases (8/58, 14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the incidence of bcl-6 hypermutation in FL and DLCL cases appeared to be comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data do not suggest a high incidence of transformation from FL to DLCL in Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequencing study also did not show an increased incidence of G397C polymorphism (heterozygote+homozygotes) in FL compared to a population with Chinese background or DLCL cases (25+5% vs 30+4% vs 22+3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reasons for the lower incidence of FL in Chinese remain unanswered </plain></SENT>
