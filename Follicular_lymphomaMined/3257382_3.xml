<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An unusual malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with a partly nodular growth pattern was studied by morphologic, immunohistochemical, and DNA hybridization techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The nodular aggregates were composed of small and large, atypical lymphoid cells, and many histiocytic elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On electron microscopy, both follicular dendritic reticulum cells and interdigitating reticulum cells were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry, using a broad panel of monoclonal antibodies, revealed a marked <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> of dendritic reticulum cells in the nodular aggregates, and showed the atypical lymphoid cells to belong to the helper/inducer T-cell subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The T-lineage of this nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was confirmed by demonstration of a clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor beta-chain genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that a nodular growth pattern caused by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> of follicular dendritic reticulum cells may occasionally be found in malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the peripheral T-cell type </plain></SENT>
