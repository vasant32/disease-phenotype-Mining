<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gene expression profiles of 20 paired lymph node biopsies, derived from the same patient pre- and post-transformation, were analysed using the Lymphochip cDNA microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TP53 mutation analysis was performed and copy number alterations at the c-REL and CDNK2A examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed on an independent panel of paired transformation paraffin-embedded samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was predominantly of the germinal centre B-like phenotype both at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite this homogeneity, transformation proceeded by at least two pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One mechanism was characterised by high proliferation, as assessed by the co-ordinately expressed genes of the proliferation signature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This group was associated with the presence of recurrent oncogenic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the remaining cases, proliferation was not increased and transformation proceeded by alternative routes as yet undetermined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Genes involved in cellular proliferation prevailed amongst those that were significantly increased upon transformation and T cell and follicular dendritic-associated genes predominated amongst those that decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>t-FL is a germinal centre B (GCB)-like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> that evolves by two pathways, one that is similar in proliferation rate to the antecedent FL and the other that has a higher proliferation rate and is characterised by the presence of recognised oncogenic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
