<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate the expression of members of the toll-like receptor (TLR) family in human B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High-density, resting, and low-density activated tonsillar B cells expressed TLR9 and TLR10 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts at the highest levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression was higher in activated B cells than in resting cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of a range of resting and activated human leukocyte populations revealed that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of TLR10 was restricted to B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of resting B cells with anti-mu and anti-CD40 antibodies or with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I bacteria (SAC) increased expression of TLR9 and TLR10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TLR1 and TLR4 expression were not significantly induced by B-cell activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a CpG oligonucleotide, a TLR9 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, also stimulated TLR9 expression in B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exposure to anti-mu antibodies augmented TLR9 expression, concomitantly and dramatically increasing the responsiveness of B cells to CpG oligonucleotides in terms of proliferation and chemokine (CC chemokine ligand 3 [CCL3] and CCL22) production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed cell lines and other cell lines representative of mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> (Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>) expressed TLR9 and/or TLR10, whereas pre-B cell lines were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results show that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic human B lymphocytes express a distinct TLR repertoire including TLR9 and TLR10 and that expression is increased upon engagement of the antigen receptor complex or TLR9 itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Regulated expression of selected TLRs in B cells is likely to play an important role in linking innate and adaptive immune responses in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathologic conditions </plain></SENT>
