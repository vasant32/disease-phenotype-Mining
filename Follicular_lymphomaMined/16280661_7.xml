<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A panel of antibodies and probes was assembled, including antibodies to ALK1, bcl-6, CDs 1alpha, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 15, 20, 23, 30, 43, 56, 68, 79alpha, and 99, cyclin D1, EMA, kappa, lambda, LMP1, PAX5, TdT, Vs38C and ZAP70, plus EBER <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> probe by in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 447 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases, subtyped according to the WHO classification, were assembled in triplicate into 11 tissue microarrays and examined with the panel of markers described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 447 cases, 385 (82.6%) were confirmed to be non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) and 62 (13.9%) were Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of classic type (CHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the NHL cases, 68.6% were B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 30.6% T/NK-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> accounted for only three cases (0.8%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 263 B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, 105 (39.9%) expressed immunoglobulin light chain, including 52 kappa and 53 lambda, detectable in paraffin sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> was similar to many Western countries and Asia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequency of FL was, however, much lower than the usual pattern in Western countries, although NK/T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were more common (30.6%), similar to other countries in Asia, including Japan and Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With regard to markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e>, 8 of 385 (2.1%) NHL cases gave positive findings by both in situ hybridization (EBER <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>) and immunohistochemistry (LMP-1), whereas 24 (6.2%) expressed only the EBER and 12 (3.1%) expressed only LMP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>EBV positivity was found in 24 of 119 (20.2%) T and NK cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, in 20 of 263 (7.6%) B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, and in 37 of 62 (59.7%) CHLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In CHLs there was complete concordance of results by both in situ hybridization (EBER <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>) and immunohistochemistry (LMP-1) procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>ZAP70 was detected in most T cell-lineage disorders (61.4%) and also in a subset of B small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, ZAP-70 was expressed in a minority of other types of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including precursor B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (25%), diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (26.7%), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (15.2%), and lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (9.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis represents an effective method for assessing ZAP-70 expression and reveals that a variety of B-cell malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> express ZAP-70, albeit at low frequency </plain></SENT>
