<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Those related to the germinal centre with nodular pattern may be: follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (LFC) or extranodal marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (LMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They are difficult to tell apart, and from reactive processes like cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> and cutis <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytomas</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to check the incidence and the value of both histology and immunohistochemistry in differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty six patients with cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were selected within the period 1995-2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The biopsies were studied with hematoxilin eosin and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty two out of the fifty six cutaneous lymphoid infiltrates were of T origin (57.1%) and twenty four of B origin (42.8%), ten out of this last figure (17.7%) were lymphoid processes with nodular pattern Four LFC, three LMC and three HLC were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Convergent follicles with scarce mantle and germinal centres with monomorph celullarity were observed in the LFC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the LMC, follicles with prominent mantle and nests of monocitoid cells in the mantle, interfollicular zone and in the germinal centers observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the HLC macrophages with detritus were found in the germinal centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LFC showed: CD20 (+), CD 10 (+), bcl-2 (+) or (-), and bcl-6 (+) in the follicle and in the interfollicular area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LMC showed: CD 20 (+), bcl-2 (-), CD 10 (+/-), and bcl-6 (+) in the follicle, and bcl-2 (+), CD10 (-/+) and bcl-6 (-) in the interfollicular area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The HLC results were: bcl-2 (-), bcl-6 (+) and CD 10 (-) in the follicle and bcl-2 (+), bcl-6 (-) and CD 10 (-) in the interfollicular zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that lymphoid B cell processes with nodular pattern are unusual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Histology and immunohistochemistry proved to be useful in the differential diagnosis of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and for differentiating these from <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasias</z:mp> or non tumoral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasias</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
