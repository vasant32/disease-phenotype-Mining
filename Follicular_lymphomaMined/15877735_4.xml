<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous microarray studies demonstrated RHOF upregulation in a subset of transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction evaluated RHOF expression in lymphocyte subpopulations, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant lymphoid tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cells and tissues of B-cell origin expressed higher RHOF levels than their T-cell counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neoplastic cells and tissues of B-cell origin expressed higher levels of RHOF than their benign cellular counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relatively elevated levels of RHOF were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> derived from germinal centre origin </plain></SENT>
