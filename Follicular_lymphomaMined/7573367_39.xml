<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A series of 121 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> samples, including 35 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>, 34 T-cell and 39 B-cells NHLs, 2 cases of adult T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 11 cases of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, were evaluated for CD40L expression by immunostaining of frozen tissue sections and flow cytometry with the anti-CD40L monoclonal antibody M90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD40L was constitutively expressed by neoplastic cells in 15 of 36 (42%) T-cell NHLs/adult T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, almost invariably those displaying the CD4+/CD8- phenotype, whereas no CD40L-expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells could be found in B-cell NHL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
