<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specific-pathogen-free female mice were allocated randomly into groups of approximately 100 at 6-8 weeks of age and then exposed for 20 h/day for up to 18 months to sinusoidal magnetic fields of 0, 1, 100 or 1000 microT, or 1000 microT pulsed 15 min on and 15 min off </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additional E mu-Pim1 mice were injected with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23995">ethylnitrosourea</z:chebi> (50 mg/kg body weight) as positive controls for enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e>; these yielded a cumulative incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of 60% in 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A lethal, transgene-dependent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal glomerular disease</z:e> occurred at a frequency that varied from 9% to 19% among the groups, but the increase was statistically significant only at the 1000-microT exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lymphoblastic and non-lymphoblastic (predominantly follicular) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were seen in 26 to 35% of the exposed mice, but at no significantly higher incidence than the 29% found in the sham-exposed mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hence we conclude that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-prone mice did not reveal any tumorigenic effect of long-term exposure to 50 Hz magnetic fields </plain></SENT>
