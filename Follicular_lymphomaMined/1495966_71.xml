<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The potential role antigens play in growth stimulation or in clonal selection of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study this issue, we sequenced the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes expressed by a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from multiple biopsy specimens and also cloned and sequenced the corresponding germ-line variable gene from this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparison to the germ-line gene revealed numerous nucleotide substitutions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> variable gene sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some of the substitutions may have occurred in the nonmalignant precursor B cell that gave rise to this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> because they were shared among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the variable genes, but many of the mutations accumulated as the malignant clone expanded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mutations were distributed in such a way that strongly suggested the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells had been positively selected through their antigen receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was especially evident for the mutations that developed late in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that antigen stimulation may be involved in the growth of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
