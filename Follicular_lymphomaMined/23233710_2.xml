<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Advanced follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) are considered incurable with conventional chemotherapy and there is no consensus on the best treatment approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Southwest <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group (SWOG) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> Group B compared the safety and efficacy of two immunochemotherapy regimens for FL in a phase III randomized intergroup protocol (SWOG S0016) that enrolled 554 patients with previously untreated, advanced-stage FL between March 1, 2001, and September 15, 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were eligible for the study if they had advanced-stage (bulky stage II, III, or IV) evaluable FL of any grade (1, 2, or 3) and had not received previous therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one arm of the study, patients received six cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHOP) chemotherapy at 3-week intervals with six doses of rituximab (CHOP-R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In another arm of the study, patients received six cycles of CHOP followed by consolidation with tositumomab/<z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> I-131 tositumomab radioimmunotherapy (RIT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median follow-up period of 4.9 years, the 2-year estimate of progression-free survival (PFS) was 76% on the CHOP-R arm and 80% on the CHOP-RIT arm (P = .11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 2-year estimate of overall survival (OS) was 97% on the CHOP-R arm and 93% on the CHOP-RIT arm (P = .08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was no evidence of a significant improvement in PFS comparing CHOP-RIT with CHOP-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, PFS and OS were outstanding on both arms of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Future studies are needed to determine the potential benefits of combining CHOP-R induction chemotherapy with RIT consolidation and/or extended rituximab maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
