<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Retrospective analysis of therapy results in patients with stage I-II and limited stage III nodal low-grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present retrospective study covers 65 patients treated between 1988 and 2006 at the Department of Radiation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo>, University of Cologne, Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>50 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone (EF [extended field]: n = 35, IF/REG [involved field/regional field]: n = 9, TNI/TLI [total nodal/total lymphatic]: n = 6), 15 patients additionally received chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median age was 58 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>58 patients presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e>-centrocytic or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, seven patients had centrocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Apart from overall and relapse-free survival, relapse patterns were examined and the impacts of patient characteristics and therapy modalities were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 9.1 years, overall 5-year and 10-year survival was 86% and 55%, relapse-free survival was 55% and 37%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relapses occurred in 28 patients during the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was favorably influenced by low patient age (p = 0.037), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e>-centrocytic/follicular histology (p = 0.006), and early disease stage (p = 0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Favorable prognostic factors for relapse-free survival were low patient age (p = 0.035) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e>-centrocytic/follicular histology (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy of early-stage low-grade NHL is a curative therapy option, particularly in younger patients and patients with follicular histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Relapse analysis confirmed the benefits of total nodal or total lymphatic irradiation, although the small number of patients needs to be considered </plain></SENT>
