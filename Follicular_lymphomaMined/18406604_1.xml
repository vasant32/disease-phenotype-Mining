<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent years have witnessed the development of a variety of promising immunotherapies for treating patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each B lymphocyte expresses an immunoglobulin molecule that is the product of a unique combination of gene segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> arises from one original B lymphocyte, and therefore <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the members of a given <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> population have the same unique immunoglobulin, which can serve as a target for immune therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the idiotype (Id), or unique portion, of each immunoglobulin is used as a vaccine, antibodies and T cells can be induced and each can cause rejection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> by the host </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This special opportunity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specificity is accompanied by the challenge of constructing a different vaccine for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first clinical trial of Id vaccination for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was initiated at Stanford University in 1988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> cells obtained from lymph node sampling were fused with a <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell line to generate a "hybridoma" producing large quantities of idiotype protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Purified Id protein was then chemically coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and emulsified in an "oil-in-water" type immunologic adjuvant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The initial trial included patients with low-grade, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, in first remission following chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the first 32 vaccinated patients, roughly half (14/32) developed anti-Id immune responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These were principally humoral responses rather than cellular responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up of these 32 patients has revealed that the development of an immune response is strongly correlated with prolonged freedom from disease progression interval and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further trials have confirmed significant clinical benefit following Id vaccination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There is reason for excitement about the prospects for effective vaccine therapies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> as randomized Id vaccine trials commence and newer cell-based vaccine trials enter the clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>As the clinical activity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> vaccines becomes established, it will be important to determine how to best integrate active vaccination approaches with standard therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
