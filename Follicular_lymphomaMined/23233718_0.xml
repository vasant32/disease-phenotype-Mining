<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We report on a multicenter phase II trial of (90)<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">yttrium</z:chebi>-ibritumomab-tiuxetan ((90)YIT) as first-line stand-alone therapy for patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with CD20(+) FL grade 1 to 3a in stages II, III, or IV, age 50 years old or older requiring therapy were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They received (90)YIT according to standard procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If complete response (CR) or unconfirmed complete response (CRu) without evidence for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) 6 months after application of (90)YIT was achieved, patients were observed without further intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same applied to patients with partial response (PR) or with stable disease (SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with CR but with persisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> were to receive a consolidation treatment with rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary end point was the clinical and molecular response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points were time to progression, safety, and tolerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six months after treatment with (90)YIT, 56% of the patients showed a CR or CRu and 31% achieved a PR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 30.6 months, the progression-free survival (PFS) was 26 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a trend for shorter PFS in patients with increased <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 26 patients who had CR 12 months after (90)YIT, only three had relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Median time to next treatment has not been reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The most common toxicities were transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000221'>leukocytopenia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nonhematologic toxicities never exceeded grade 2 according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v2.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: (90)YIT is well tolerated and achieves high response rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Patients with increased LDH tend to relapse earlier, and individuals in remission 1 year after (90)YIT appear to have long- lasting responses </plain></SENT>
