<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic evidence of an association between tobacco smoking and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has been conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may reflect that non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> comprises several distinct disease entities with different etiologies, as some studies have indicated an association between smoking and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between cigarette smoking and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> risk, overall and by subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: As part of a nationwide Danish-Swedish population-based case-control study, we interviewed 3,055 incident non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients and 3,187 population controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were uniformly classified according to the WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used unconditional logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the association between cigarette smoking and risk of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cigarette smoking was not associated with the risk of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> overall (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87-1.08) nor with the major subgroups such as diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.79-1.10), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.72-1.02), or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.85-1.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Female smokers were at a marginally increased risk of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.04-1.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Men who had ever smoked had a significantly increased risk of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.11-2.51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No dose-response association with cigarette smoking could be established for any <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found little evidence of an association between cigarette smoking and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> risk overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although increased risks of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in female smokers and of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in male smokers were suggested, no dose-response relationship was observed, leaving limited support for causality </plain></SENT>
