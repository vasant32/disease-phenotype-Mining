<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) constitutes the second most common non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the Western world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical course is variable and only in part explained by known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-intrinsic or -extrinsic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FL carries the hallmark chromosomal translocation t(14;18), deregulating the expression of Bcl-2, but this is not sufficient to explain either FL biology or clinical behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We have employed high-density genomic profiling technology using the Affymetrix 50K-XbaI oligonucleotide single nucleotide polymorphism-chip platform to interrogate the genomes of 58 fluorescence-activated cell-sorted (FACS) FL specimens for chromosomal copy number changes and 46 specimens for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We report (a) previously unknown high-frequency copy-neutral LOH (<z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp>) in FL on chromosomes 1p (approximately 50%) and 6p (approximately 30%); (b) that del6q is complex, as reported, with at least two regions of minimal common loss at 6q13-15 and 6q23-24, and that in addition, approximately 8% of FL specimens contain a homozygous deletion at 6q23.3-24.1 that spans the negative NFkappaB regulator A20 and the p53 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> effector PERP; (c) that combined analysis of chromosome 17p for LOH, copy number, and p53 mutations shows that most p53 mutations in FL do not involve del17p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, we map high-frequency LOH with and without copy loss on chromosomes 9p, 10q, and 16p and genomic gains on 2p15-16 and 8q24.22-24.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive description of the pathologic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the FL genome uncovers novel genetic lesions and should aid with identification of genes relevant to FL biology and clinical behavior </plain></SENT>
