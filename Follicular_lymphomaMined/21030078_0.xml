<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The promoter and coding region of the DCK gene were analyzed in 74 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) patients receiving a therapeutic regimen that included fludarabine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DCK <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was quantified in a cohort of healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four previously described genotypic variants, -360C&gt;G, -201C&gt;T (rs2306744), C28624T (rs11544786) and c.91+37G&gt;C (rs9997790), as well as the new variant, -12C&gt;G, were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Variant C28624T showed a lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> (P=0.04), but a higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical significance was found in bivariate logistic regression between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> and infectious episodes in the induction period (odds ratio 3.85, P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
