<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, due to their cardiac toxicity potential, curative and palliative treatment is often limited in patients with preexisting cardiac dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Liposomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> formulations have been described to be less cardiotoxic than conventional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we analyzed the efficacy and toxicity of pegylated liposomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> (PLD) as constituent of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHOP) regimen replacing conventional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> in 21 patients with impaired cardiac left ventricular ejection fraction or preexisting cardiac risk factors and established diagnosis of diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 15), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 3), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 1), and T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall and complete response rate were 85% and 40%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival and overall survival after 2 years were 58% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One lethal event of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred during the first cycle in a patient with transposition of the big arteries, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral valve regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 20 patients, no deterioration of myocardial function was observed in echocardiography performed before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven cases of grade III-IV hematological toxicity were observed as well as four episodes of neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> leading to hospitalization </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, 25% of patients developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549410" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hand-foot syndrome</z:e> (HFS) leading to discontinuation of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the incidence of HFS increased considerably when PLD doses of 15 mg/m(2)/week were exceeded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that replacing conventional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> with PLD in polychemotherapy regimens such as CHOP is an efficient alternative in the treatment of patients with preexisting cardiac dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, we recommend that PLD dose should not exceed 15 mg/m(2)/week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The rationale for the use of non-pegylated liposomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> formulations should be evaluated in further studies </plain></SENT>
