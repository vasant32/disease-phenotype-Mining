<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols have been developed to detect the t(14;18) translocation, which juxtaposes the bcl-2 proto-oncogene to the Ig heavy-chain (IgH) gene in 85% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and monoclonal rearrangements of the IgH gene in B-cell NHL that lack bcl-2 rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used PCR to amplify bcl-2 and IgH rearrangements in DNA from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> and analyzed the products in parallel by gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry, which detected PCR products incorporating fluoresceinated oligonucleotide primers by sequence-specific capture to oligonucleotide-coated magnetic beads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, flow cytometry was superior to electrophoresis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4883">ethidium-bromide</z:chebi>-stained <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gels for detection of products of nested PCR to detect intergenic rearrangements involving bcl-2 and single primer-pair amplification of clonal rearrangement of IgH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis detected bcl-2 translocations in 12 of 13 CD10+ B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and clonal IgH rearrangements in 14 of 17 monoclonal B-cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, analysis by gel electrophoresis detected bcl-2 translocations in only 10 of 13 CD10+ and clonal IgH gene rearrangements in only 9 of 17 monoclonal B-cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis was more sensitive than gel electrophoresis and could detect a 16-fold greater dilution of a bcl-2-amplified product than gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, flow cytometry could detect an amplification product when template DNA was diluted 10,000-fold, whereas gel electrophoresis only detected amplification products when template was subjected to dilution between 100- and 1,000-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This shows the utility of flow cytometry for the analysis of DNA amplification products incorporating <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51217">fluorochrome</z:chebi>-labeled primers as a rapid, objective alternative to conventional strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because current-generation clinical laboratories emphasize automation, flow cytometric analysis of PCR-amplified products shows increased analytic sensitivity and offers a vehicle for automation of DNA amplification tests </plain></SENT>
