<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify whether p53 mutation could be involved in the pathogenesis of various subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we investigated 62 Japanese cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHLs) for p53 gene mutations and their relationship with the expression of p53 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in exons 5-9 of the p53 gene were screened for using the non-isotopic RNase cleavage assay (NIRCA) and confirmed by direct sequencing, followed by immunohistochemical analysis for p53 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Missense and/or nonsense mutations of p53 were detected in 3 (10.7%) of 28 diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DLBLs) and 2 (15.4%) of 13 T-cell NHLs (15.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A single missense mutation at codon 157 (Val to Phe) in exon 5 and at codon 273 (Arg to Pro) in exon 8 was found respectively in 2 DLBLs and in one peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (unspecified) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these 3 cases harbouring a missense mutation, overexpression of p53 protein was observed in more than 80% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Double transversion mutations comprising of a missense mutation at codon 167 (Gln to His) in exon 5 and a nonsense mutation at codon 183 (Ser to stop codon) in exon 5 were detected in one DLBL that had apparently transformed from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in one advanced adult T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ATL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these two cases harbouring p53 nonsense mutation, no cells positive for p53 protein immunostaining were detected, as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> without p53 mutation </plain></SENT>
