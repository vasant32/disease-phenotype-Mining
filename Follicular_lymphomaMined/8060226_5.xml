<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There are conflicting data regarding the detection of t(14;18) in reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> (RLH) by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although most studies have not detected t(14;18), several groups have definitively shown that a very low number of cells with this translocation (one in 10(5) to 10(6)) are present in a significant proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Review of the methods from these series reveals that modifications of the PCR assay (ie, enhanced sensitivity steps such as seminesting, lengthy autoradiographic exposure times, multiple aliquot reactions of single samples, and/or high concentrations of template DNA) are probably necessary to detect t(14;18) in RLH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated a diverse set of 111 RLH (85 lymph nodes, 22 tonsils, and four other sites) from patients of different age groups (age range, 9 months to 80 years) to determine if a standard PCR assay would amplify t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 61 (55%) specimens had a prominent follicular hyperplastic component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> served as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction was performed as a single-run, two-primer-based assay for major breakpoint region bcl-2 translocations (5' major breakpoint region primer and 3' immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene-joining region consensus primer) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two different types of thermocyclers were employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A metal block thermocycler was used with 35 cycles of amplification on 500 ng to 1 micrograms of genomic DNA, and a separate air thermocycler was used with 45 cycles of amplification on 50 ng of genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Product detection was carried out through <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4883">ethidium bromide</z:chebi> staining and UV gel illumination, along with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42098">digoxigenin</z:chebi>-alkaline phosphatase-based, internal major breakpoint region oligonucleotide probe system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found no amplified t(14;18) products in any RLH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 36 (63%) of 57 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed t(14;18) (published range for detection of major breakpoint region translocations by PCR, 31% to 74%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the assay's sensitivity, estimated through dilution studies, was to one in 10(4) to 10(5) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although theoretically possible, our data suggest that there is practically no risk of amplifying a t(14;18) from RLH when utilizing a standard PCR assay </plain></SENT>
