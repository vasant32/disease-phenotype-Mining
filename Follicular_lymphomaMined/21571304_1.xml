<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relevance of TILs in the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small-cell lung cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e>), however, still remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the outcomes of stage 1A <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e> with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> infiltrating lymphocytes to evaluate the effects of TILs on recurrence and survival patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2000 to 2009, 273 anatomic segmentectomies and lobectomies were performed on stage 1A <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified into TIL- and TIL+ cohorts based on pathologic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further investigation was conducted on the effects of TILs in patients with and without angiolymphatic invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Variables analyzed include overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and type of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall 5-y survival was not affected by TIL status (65% versus 60%, P = 0.469) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five-year recurrence-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) was significantly increased in the TIL+ group versus the TIL- group (87% versus 73%, P = 0.011), most significantly in women (P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of angiolymphatic invasion (ALI) was associated with decreased 5-y <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> versus patients without ALI (61% versus 85%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in the ALI negative group, TIL+ patients experienced a significantly increased 5-y recurrence-free survival versus TIL- patients (93% versus 80%, P = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High levels of intratumoral TILs are associated with improved recurrence-free survival in stage 1A <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e> patients as well as a reduced likelihood of systemic recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When angiolymphatic invasion is not present, the beneficial effects of TILs become even more profound </plain></SENT>
