<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There has been no previous systematic study of the distribution of the major subtypes of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) across geographic regions, although there have been isolated reports of such differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: As part of a clinical evaluation of the International <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Study Group (ILSG) classification of NHL, we classified 1378 NHLs from eight different geographic sites (Omaha, NE, USA; Vancouver, BC, Canada; Capetown, South Africa; London, England; Würzburg/Göttingen, Germany; Lyon, France; Locarno/Bellinzona, Switzerland; and Hong Kong) using the ILSG classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Substantial differences were found in the distribution of the major subtypes of NHL across geographic regions (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A greater percentage of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was seen in North America, London and Capetown (31% versus 14% at other sites) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was more common in London, Capetown and Hong Kong (9%) than elsewhere (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Locarno/Bellinzona, higher percentages of mediastinal large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (9% versus 2% elsewhere) and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (14% versus 6% elsewhere) were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiocentric nasal T-/NK-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was only seen in Hong Kong (8%) and Lyon (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence that the distribution of NHL subtypes differs by geographic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that geographical differences in etiologic or host factors may be responsible for the observed differences in the distribution of cases across NHL subtypes </plain></SENT>
