<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cloning of the breakpoints of these translocations has facilitated the identification of a number of BCL6 partners including immunoglobulin genes and more than 20 non-immunoglobulin genes on almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> human chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fusion of BCL6 with these genes leads to deregulated BCL6 expression because of substitution of its promoter with that of the translocation partner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite the promiscuous nature of BCL6 translocations, intrachromosomal rearrangements of the BCL6 gene have not been well recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we present evidence for intrachromosomal rearrangements, because of interstitial deletions and inversions, involving region 3q27 as an overlooked mechanism of BCL6 deregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These rearrangements accounted for 3/20 (15%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BCL6 translocations occurring in B-NHL, including follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, diagnosed at our institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to confirming previously described partner loci on chromosome 3, we also identified a novel BCL6 partner locus (3p24) that to our knowledge has not been reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data should help facilitate the identification of new BCL6 partner genes, which may enhance our understanding of the clinical and biological role of BCL6 in B-NHL pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
