<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined 81 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> for evidence of the t(14;18) translocation, using the polymerase chain reaction assay on lysates of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven of 74 amplifiable cases (9%) were positive for the translocation, which involves the bcl-2 oncogene and the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two of these cases were sequenced and the breakpoints had the same pattern found in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The nuclei from one of the cases were sorted into large and small subpopulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18) signal was more intense in the large nucleus subpopulation, which contained a greater proportion of Reed-Sternberg-like nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with the hypothesis that Reed-Sternberg cells carry the translocation, but they do not exclude the possibility that the translocation is found in cells representing the reactive component of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results also demonstrate that routinely processed material is suitable for polymerase chain reaction-based analysis of translocations, although the sensitivity is reduced 10- to 100-fold, compared with fresh tissue </plain></SENT>
