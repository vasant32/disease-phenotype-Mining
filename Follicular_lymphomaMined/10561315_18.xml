<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred eighty-four patients with Ann Arbor stage III-IV follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> treated in two phase III trials from 1986 to 1995 were screened for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> histologic slides were reviewed by two hematopathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The influence of the initial parameters on survival was defined by univariate (log-rank test) and multivariate (Cox model) analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The poor prognostic factors for OS (age &gt; 60 years, "B" symptom(s), &gt; or = two extranodal sites, stage IV disease, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> bulk &gt; 7 cm, at least three nodal sites &gt; 3 cm, liver involvement, serous effusion-compression or orbital/epidural involvement, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate &gt; 30 mm/h) that were significant in univariate analysis were subjected to multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three factors remained significant: B symptom(s) (risk ratio = 1.80), age greater than 60 years (risk ratio = 1.60), and at least three nodal sites greater than 3 cm (risk ratio = 1.71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the IPI was applied to these patients, the score was 1, 2, 3, and 4-5 in 49%, 39%, 11%, and 2%, respectively, and it was significant for progression-free survival (P =.002) and OS (P =.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Three prognostic factors for poor OS were identified: B symptoms, age greater than 60 years, and at least three nodal sites greater than 3 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The IPI was prognostic for OS, but in this population, a very low number of patients belonged to the high-risk groups </plain></SENT>
