<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Translocations involving immunoglobulin (IG) loci are the hallmarks of several subtypes of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Common to these translocations is that cellular proto-oncogenes come under the influence of IG regulatory elements leading to deregulated expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In case of a breakpoint in the IGH switch region, oncogene activation can take place on both derivative chromosomes, which means that in principle one translocation can result in concurrent activation of two genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), we identified a case of leukemic B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in a child with an IGH break and unknown partner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequent long-distance inverse PCR revealed fusion of IGH Sl in 14q32 and the 50 region of CBFA2T3 in 16q24.3, suggesting presence of the t(14;16)(q32;q24.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Candidate oncogenes targeted through this translocation are CBFA2T3 and ACSF3, which could be activated on der(16) and der(14), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FISH screening of a population-based cohort of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> from a prospective trial for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in childhood (BFM-NHL) identified additionally a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Grade 3/diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with IGH-CBFA2T3/ACSF3 juxtaposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> shared expression of CD10 and CD20 in the absence of TdT, suggesting a germinal center (GC) B-cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that the CBFA2T3/ACSF3 locus is a novel recurrent oncogenic target of IGH translocations, which might contribute to the pathogenesis of pediatric GC-derived B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
