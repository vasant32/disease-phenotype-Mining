<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fifty cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (15 nodular and 35 diffuse) were studied to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and ease of several different immunoperoxidase methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The methods included a rapid, simple one-step immunoperoxidase procedure on frozen sections compared with indirect immunoperoxidase technics on paraffin sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frozen-section immunoperoxidase technic stained 15 of 15 nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 24 of 35 diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> for monoclonal light chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of the diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that did not stain for light chains were morphologically and immunohistochemically consistent with T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The indirect method on B-5 and formalin-fixed tissues only rarely displayed monoclonal staining for nonplasmacytoid small cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> but did stain some large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and a majority of plasmacytoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> for monoclonal light chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frozen section technic presented in this report is sufficiently sensitive and reliable to detect immunoglobulins in any morphologic subtype of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, whereas paraffin-embedded tissues have only limited application </plain></SENT>
