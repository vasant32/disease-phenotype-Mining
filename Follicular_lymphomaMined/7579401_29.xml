<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 67 cases of FL, VH region genes were expressed in a pattern similar to that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells, with a predominance of the large VH3 gene family being used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, of the 17 cases of DLC, there was an extremely biased use of VH genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these DLC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, 88% expressed genes from the small VH4 gene family; and even among these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, there was a limited use of genes, with 11 cases producing Igs derived from the VH4.21 germline gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although most of the VH genes expressed by DLC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells contained mutations with respect to their germline counterparts, almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these mutations occurred before the clonal expansion of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This contrasts with our previous findings of ongoing mutations in FL and represents a fundamental difference between these two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This preferential gene use implies an important role for the VH4 gene family, and specifically for VH4.21, in the genesis of DLC </plain></SENT>
