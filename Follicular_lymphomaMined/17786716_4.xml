<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The male to female ratio was 1:1.7 and median patient age was 57 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The parotid gland (n = 22) was involved most frequently, followed by the submandibular gland (n = 5) and minor salivary gland (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four (80%) cases demonstrated Stage IE, whereas only six (20%) had Stage IIE-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the 30 cases had "B" symptoms or a poor performance status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall survival of 31 cases was 96% and 5-year failure-free survival was 77% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histologically, 15 cases were mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, seven were follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), and six were diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) + MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and only two were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> without a MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is the most frequent type of primary salivary gland <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, FL comprised 20% of primary salivary gland <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of the primary salivary gland <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> appear to arise from MALT type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When appropriate therapy for histologic subtype is used, outcome of the primary salivary gland B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> appears excellent whether histologically indolent or aggressive </plain></SENT>
