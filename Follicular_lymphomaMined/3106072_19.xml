<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our mouse cDNA clone detects 7.9 and 6.3-kb bcl-2 RNAs in mouse B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, but only in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> consisting of pre-B and follicular center mature B cells, not in pro-B cell or <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>plasma cell tumors</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, this gene appears to be a B cell differentiation marker that is expressed only in committed B cells, but is shut off in end stage plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This pattern of expression is unique among oncogenes, and we suggest that it may be responsible for the high frequency of translocations at this locus in the common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> of human mature B cells, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
