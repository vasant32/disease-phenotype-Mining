<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Historically, the median overall survival for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) has been considered to be 9-10 years, and no treatment had ever prolonged this time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies conducted more than 20 years ago demonstrated that treating patients with asymptomatic FL at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease did not increase their survival, and that almost 20% of these patients did not need any treatment in the first 10 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on these facts, most clinical practice guidelines recommend active surveillance policies for patients with asymptomatic FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The introduction of antiCD-20 monoclonal antibodies, over the last 15 years, has significantly increased the median survival rate to above 14 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This improvement was achieved before the combination of rituximab and chemotherapy regimens became extensively used in patients with symptomatic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this increase in survival may currently be more significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At present, several clinical trials have evaluated low-toxicity therapies that prolong progression-free periods, among which rituximab monotherapy, radioimmunotherapy or the combination of rituximab with bendamustine are the most relevant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, these clinical trials have included only patients with symptomatic FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of a recently reported clinical trial show that treatment with single-agent rituximab prolongs progression-free survival rates, time to new treatment and the quality of life of asymptomatic patients, as compared with the active surveillance strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Longer follow-up of these results and data regarding overall survival are awaited before this treatment can be recommended as the standard initial therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: There are different therapeutic possibilities for asymptomatic FL patients, but no data are currently available to indicate which option is the best </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients need to understand the risks and benefits of observation versus treatment before a final decision can be made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For patients who want active treatment the administration of four weekly rituximab doses should be considered </plain></SENT>
