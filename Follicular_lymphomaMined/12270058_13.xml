<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunotherapy with the humanised monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab represents a new therapeutic option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to determine the effectiveness and safety of rituximab in the consolidation setting of first-line treated patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus the goal was first to reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> burden using the CHOP regimen as induction treatment followed by consolidation with rituximab administered on a standard 4 wk schedule at a dosage of 375 mg m-2 body surface area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between August 1998 and April 2001, 41 patients were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were evaluable with regard to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> response and toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall remission rate in the intent-to-treat analysis was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On subgroup analysis, 20 [83% (95% CI: 63-95%)] of the 24 patients with grade 1 or 2 histology entered complete remission (CR), in 10 cases (42%) after additional rituximab therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rituximab thus led to CR in 10/14 patients [71% (95% CI: 42-92%)] who had merely achieved partial remission (PR) with CHOP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 16 evaluable patients with grade 3 histology (excluding one patient achieving CR on CHOP who refused further treatment with rituximab), 15 [94% (95% CI: 63-97%)] achieved CR, 13 (81%) of these while still receiving CHOP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two of the three patients achieving only PR on CHOP entered CR following rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients (83%) continued to be in remission during a median follow-up period of 24.3 (9-40) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the use of rituximab for consolidation after CHOP may improve CHOP-induced remission and thus increase the CR rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it was accompanied by a reduced rate of infusion-related side-effects </plain></SENT>
