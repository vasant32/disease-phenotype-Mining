<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the potential for long-term survival for patients who relapsed after primary radiation therapy (RT) for early-stage low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and to assess the relative importance of prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: Records were reviewed for 79 patients with stage I (n = 32) and II (n = 47) follicular small cleaved cell (fsc, n = 48) and follicular mixed small cleaved cell and large-cell (fmx, n = 31) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who relapsed after radical RT at Stanford University </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most patients had received doses of 35 to 45 Gy to involved (n = 30) or extended fields (n = 39) or total/subtotal lymphoid irradiation (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median time to relapse was 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most relapses were detected on history (30%) or physical examination (66%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positive relapse investigations included lymphangiogram (n = 19), chest radiograph (n = 5), and bone marrow biopsy (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Known extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relapsed disease</z:e> was: stage I, n = 30; stage II, n = 26; stage III, n = 10; and stage IV, n = 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were managed with "watchful waiting" (37%), further RT (39%), chemotherapy [CT, (17%)], or RT + CT (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival rates after relapse at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years were 56%, 35%, 17%, and 17% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 5.3 years after relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median survival for relapse stage I, II, III, and IV was 10.2, 5.5, 3.0, and 1.1 years respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival rates at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years after relapse were 44%, 22%, 22%, and 22% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with reduced survival were increasing age, increasing relapse stage, symptoms, histologic transformation and &gt; or = 3 relapse sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Survival was the same for initial management with "watchful waiting" or RT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Approximately 20% of patients experienced prolonged survival after relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Younger, asymptomatic patients with stage I-II <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relapsed disease</z:e> had the best outcome but results were inferior to those for newly diagnosed stage I-II disease </plain></SENT>
