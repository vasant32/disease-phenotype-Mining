<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>71 patients (177 symptomatic sites) received LD-IF-RT consisting of 39 males and 32 females with a median age of 69 years (range 43-93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients included were those with small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (n=23), marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, nodal type (n=18), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=17), and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bulky disease (5 cm) was present in 73% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A median of two prior chemotherapy regimens (range 0-10) preceded LD-IF-RT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median time since diagnosis was 31 months (range 1-216 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Time to (local) progression was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences in response rates were compared using the chi2-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results showed that overall response rate was 87%; complete remission (CR) was reached in 34 patients (48%) and a partial remission (PR) in 28 patients (39%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stable disease (SD) was maintained in nine patients (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median time to progression (TP) was 12 months and the median time to local progression (TLP) was 22 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 34 CR patients showed a median TP of 16 months and a median TLP of 23 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>None of the factors studied (age, sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtype, radiotherapy regimen, number of prior regimens or time since diagnosis, number of positive sites or largest <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diameter) were found to relate to response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> 70% of patients were without in-field progression after LD-IF-RT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It appears that LD-IF-RT is a valuable asset in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relapsed disease</z:e> in both indolent and aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and should be considered to palliate symptoms in patients with recurrent and/or chemotherapy refractory disease </plain></SENT>
