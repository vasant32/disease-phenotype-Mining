<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We observed a potentially misinterpretable polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification product generated with standard primers used to detect the major breakpoint region (mbr) of chromosomal translocation t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This unexpected phenomenon was initially detected during attempts to transform follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in vitro with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additional studies were performed using the EBV-producing cell line MCUV5, cell lines from EBV-transformed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-lymphocytes, and an excised lymph node from a patient with documented EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These samples consistently produced a 167-base pair product, which was indistinguishable from a t(14;18) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> product when viewed on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4883">ethidium bromide</z:chebi>-stained gels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Through DNA sequencing and gene bank analysis, the product was identified as a portion of the EBV genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A mbr-specific 20-base oligonucleotide probe was able to discriminate between true translocations and the EBV-related amplifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results underscore the importance of employing a specific detection system, and comprehensively screening primers when working with PCR </plain></SENT>
