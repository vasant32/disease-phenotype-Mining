<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated serum CD44, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 levels in 100 patients with newly diagnosed indolent NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median pre-treatment values of the markers were as follows: CD44 540 ng/mL (range 156-1201), ICAM-1 311 ng/mL (range 102-1222) and VCAM-1 1165 ng/mL (range 248-4779) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, elevated sCD44, sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 were significantly associated with worse overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a subset analysis of patients with stage IV disease, the effects of sCD44 and sICAM-1 on OS persisted (p&lt;0.05), as did the effect of sCD44 on PFS (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis that included conventional prognostic factors and the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) model, sICAM-1 demonstrated prognostic value for OS and PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that serum CD44, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 can potentially be prognostic in patients with indolent NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Though the FLIPI model remains the gold standard for prognosis, these quantitative serologic markers may be useful as adjunct tools in assessing disease risk </plain></SENT>
