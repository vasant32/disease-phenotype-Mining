<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of a t(1;14)(q21;q32) in a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) with an unusual BCL2 aberration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and Southern blot analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells identified the translocation breakpoint within the 5' switch region of IGHG (Sgamma) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We cloned the chimeric breakpoint region approximately 1.5 kbp downstream from the HindIII site of 5'Sgamma2 on chromosome 14q32 and identified a 360-bp novel segment with homology to the CpG island clone 11h8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two BAC clones containing this sequence were isolated and mapped to 1q21 by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BAC 342/P13 contained sequences homologous to Fcgamma receptors 2A, 3A, 2B, 3B, and a heat shock protein gene HSP70B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The translocation brought the Sgamma2 region of a productive IGH allele 20 approximately 30 kbp upstream of FCGR2B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a result of the translocation, the b2 isoform of FCGR2B was overexpressed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Screening of a panel of 76 B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with 1q21-23 cytogenetic aberrations by Southern blot analysis using breakpoint probes identified an additional FL with a t(14;18)(q32;q21) and a breakpoint in the FCGR2B region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that FCGR2B may be deregulated by 1q21 aberration in BCL2 rearranged FLs and possibly play a role in their progression </plain></SENT>
