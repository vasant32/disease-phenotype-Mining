<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analysed the complete open reading frame (ORF) of the bcl-2 gene for the presence of mutations in 24 bcl-2/IgH-positive diagnostic FL samples by the single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A prior analysis on many of these FL samples had revealed a consistent pattern of somatic hypermutation in IgH genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abnormally migrating bands on SSCP gels were identified only in 4/24 samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This result provides strong support for the notion that in FL the translocated bcl-2 coding region is not targeted by somatic hypermutation </plain></SENT>
