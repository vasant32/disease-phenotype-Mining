<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18) is the most common genetic alteration in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and is detectable in a subset of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), resulting in over-expression of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the t(14;18)-induced over-expression of BCL-2 is an important step in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e>, this aberration alone is not sufficient to produce malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further analysis of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> is needed to identify additional genes that might be involved in the genesis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of four t(14;18)-positive cell lines and two t(11;14)-positive mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines using cDNA microarrays containing 4364 genes, and compared them to the genetic profile of phenotypically purified B-cells obtained from hyperplastic tonsils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 137 genes were differentially expressed by approximately twofold or more in the t(14;18) cell lines relative to tonsillar B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>68 genes were up-regulated, 69 genes were down-regulated, and approximately 20% of the differentially regulated genes had no known function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The up-regulated genes included a number of genes involved in the promotion of cellular proliferation and survival, as well as cell metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Down-regulated genes included mediators of cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and negative regulators of cell activation and growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hierarchical clustering analysis separated the t(14;18) and mantle-cell lines into distinct groups based on their gene expression profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We confirmed the differential expression of approximately 80% of selected up- and down-regulated genes identified by microarray analysis by quantitative real-time fluorescence reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis and/or immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates the utility of cDNA microarray analysis for the assessment of global transcriptional changes that characterize t(14;18)-positive cell lines, and also for the identification of novel genes that could potentially contribute to the genesis and progression of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with this translocation </plain></SENT>
