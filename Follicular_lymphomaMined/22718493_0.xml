<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether polymorphisms in complement genes are associated with event-free survival (EFS) in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) and diffuse large B-cell (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We genotyped 167 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 30 complement pathway genes in a prospective cohort study of newly diagnosed FL (N = 107) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (N = 82) patients enrolled at the Mayo Clinic from 2002 to 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for individual SNPs with EFS, adjusting for FLIPI or IPI and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For gene-level analyses, we used a principal components based gene-level test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In gene-level analyses for FL EFS, CFH (P = 0.009), CD55 (P = 0.006), CFHR5 (P = 0.01), C9 (P = 0.02), CFHR1 (P = 0.03), and CD46 (P = 0.03) were significant at P &lt; 0.05, and these genes remained noteworthy after accounting for multiple testing (q &lt; 0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SNPs in CFH, CFHR1, and CFHR5 showed stronger associations among patients receiving any rituximab, while SNPs from CD55 and CD46 showed stronger associations among patients who were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, only CLU (P = 0.001) and C7 (P = 0.03) were associated with EFS, but did not remain noteworthy after accounting for multiple testing (q&gt;0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genes from the regulators of complement activation (CFH, CD55, CFHR1, CFHR5, CD46) at 1q32-q32.1, along with C9, were associated with FL EFS after adjusting for clinical variables, and if replicated, these findings add further support for the role of host innate immunity in FL prognosis </plain></SENT>
