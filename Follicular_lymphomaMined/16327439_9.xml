<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We repeatedly observed in cases with conserved reactive follicle structures (so-called partial infiltration) an association with a limited clinical stage (I/II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed 53 lymph node biopsies of FL with conserved reactive follicle structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 44 cases (83%) of the patients with partial infiltration, a limited stage of disease (Ann Arbor stage I/II) was found, whereas only 9 of 53 cases (17%) suffered from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In those cases with at least one follicle totally spared by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 95% of the patients (38 of 40 cases) presented with a limited stage (I/II) of disease, compared with only 20% (10 of 49 cases) in a control group with full-blown infiltration (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analyzing systematically <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 321 FL cases sent to the Reference Center WÃ¼rzburg in the year 2001, reactive follicle remnants were detected in 34 of 321 (10.6%) cases with 26 of 34 (76%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> showing limited stage (I/II) disease, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 18 cases with at least one totally spared follicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results therefore show a clear association between the occurrence of preserved reactive follicles in FL and limited disease stage </plain></SENT>
