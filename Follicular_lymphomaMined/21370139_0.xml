<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The identification and study of nonrandom recurrent chromosomal translocations has substantially increased our understanding of the non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic and molecular genetic data now form an integral part of current <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> classifications (1) and provide important information for diagnosis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biology, and in some cases prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18)(q32;q21) abnormality is the most common translocation detected in B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and results in juxtaposition of the BCL-2 gene (18q21) and the JH locus of the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain gene (14q32) (2-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More specifically, in the North American population, alterations of the BCL-2 gene are detected in approx 75 to 85% of low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 20-30% of aggressive large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and rarely in other B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>) (2,6-9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a consequence of the BCL-2/JH fusion, deregulated overexpression of the antiapoptotic bcl-2 protein occurs owing to constitutive transcriptional activation of the BCL-2 gene by the Ig heavy chain gene enhancer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The unbridled expression of bcl-2 protein in <z:mp ids='MP_0002022'>lymphoid tumors</z:mp> confers resistance to programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (10,11) and is implicated in primary therapeutic failure and a less favorable prognosis (12-14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although karyotypic detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-associated translocations such as the t(14;18) has proved to be useful in disease diagnosis and subcategorization, molecular genetic approaches including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) have gained substantial popularity owing to their rapidity, relatively low cost, and increased sensitivity (6,15-22) </plain></SENT>
