<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In mutation cases, B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> accounted for 2 cases and the other one was T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven strains out of 9 kinds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines had P53 gene point mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One strain had the mutation in exon 5; 5 strains in exon 6 and 1 strain in exons 5, 6, 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a high mutation rate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and low mutation rate in NHL patients </plain></SENT>
