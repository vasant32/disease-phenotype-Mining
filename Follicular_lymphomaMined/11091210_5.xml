<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The molecular basis accounting for the peculiar clinical and biological features of hairy cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (HCL) is currently unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deregulation of cell cycle genes plays a significant role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> and there is considerable evidence suggesting that Cdk inhibitors (Ckis) function as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We and others have recently demonstrated low expression of Cki p27 in very aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether HCL cases express <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> p27 protein, as in other low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with a low proliferation index, 58 cases of HCL were characterized using a sensitive <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-streptavidin-immunoperoxidase technique and specific antibodies against p27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> HCL cases showed either no or very weak reactivity, in contrast to other types of low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> [22 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (CLL), 12 cases of gastric marginal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (MALT), 16 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and two cases of splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To investigate the possible mechanism(s) accounting for the low p27 expression observed in hairy cells, multiple approaches were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to these molecular studies, low levels of p2 7 are not as a result of (1) increased ubiquitin-mediated degradation, (2) decreased levels of p27 transcription or (3) p27 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> and/or allelic loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that low p27 protein expression in HCL may be achieved through post-transcriptional regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, our data demonstrate that p27 expression in HCL does not correlate with either cell cycle progression or proliferation index, suggesting that low levels of p27 in hairy cells may be associated with their unique stage of B-cell differentiation and/or the activation of as yet unknown pathways </plain></SENT>
