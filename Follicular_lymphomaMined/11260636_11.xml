<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, only 5 cases have been reported to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a case in a 6-year-old boy who presented with painless right scrotal enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Right radical orchiectomy revealed a follicular large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with diffuse areas confined to the testis and epididymis, clinical stage IE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical stains demonstrated that the neoplastic cells were of B-cell lineage, positive for CD10, CD20, CD79a, and BCL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Staining for CD21 accentuated networks of dendritic reticulum cells within the nodules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cells were negative for BCL-2, p53, and T-cell antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of the t(14;18) detected by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the testis in children has a different pathogenesis than follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in adults </plain></SENT>
