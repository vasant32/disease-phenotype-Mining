<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From March 2005 to August 2006, 77 prospective patients were included, 69 (90%) with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The last salvage chemotherapy regimen included rituximab for 74 patients and ASCT for 75 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before ASCT, rates of complete response/unconfirmed response (CR/CRu) and partial response were 77% and 23%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After zevaline-BEAM (Z-BEAM), time to &gt;1 × 10(9)/L neutrophils was 12 days (range, 9-35 days), and time to &gt;20 × 10(9)/L platelets was 12 days (range, 3-42 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No other significant extrahematologic toxicity was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three months after ASCT, 68 patients (88%) were in CR/CRu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 28 months, 2-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival were 63% and 97%, respectively, but EFS for first-relapsed patients was 72% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When using patients as their own controls, 2-year EFS was superior after ASCT and compared favorably with the duration of response of last chemotherapy (62% vs. 37%, P = .007) (Point 1.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Z-BEAM appears safe and needs to be further evaluated in a randomized trial </plain></SENT>
