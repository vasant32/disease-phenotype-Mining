<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The chromosomal breakpoints of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> carrying the t(14;18)(q32;q21) are known to be clustered within a 150-bp region in the major breakpoint region (mbr) of the Bcl-2 oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that nuclear proteins specifically bind to a novel target sequence within this 150-bp region and a region of Dxp genes, members of the immunoglobulin (Ig) diversity (DH) gene family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One protein, designated BCLF-1, appears to be specifically expressed in lymphoid lineage cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two other proteins, BCLF-2 and -3, bind only to the complementary single strand of the target sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The manner in which these proteins interact with the target sequence is similar to the interaction of the ReHF-1 and -2 proteins to the signal-like sequence at the chromosomal breakpoint junctions in patients with the t(8;14)(q24;q11) and t(1;14)(p32;q11) translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was further suggested that the BCLF-1 is quite similar to or identical to the ReHF-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is therefore hypothesized that these conserved target sequences found in recombination hotspot regions may define novel sequence motifs recognized by two classes of DNA binding proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One class of DNA binding proteins is specifically expressed in lymphoid cells while the other class binds to the complementary single strand DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These binding activities may play a crucial role in chromosomal translocation in lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
