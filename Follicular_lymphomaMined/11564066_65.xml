<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have shown previously that the anti-CD20 chimaeric monoclonal antibody rituximab exerts its effects on neoplastic B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines in part via complement-dependent cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, membrane expression levels of complement inhibitory proteins CD55 and CD59 play a role in determining susceptibility to lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have identified one t(14;18)-positive human B-cell non Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (Karpas 422) that is resistant to rituximab and complement and used it for subsequent studies on the possible interaction between this novel therapeutic agent and established <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have exposed Karpas to several chemotherapeutic agents (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">taxol</z:chebi>) for different time periods and subsequently exposed the cells to rituximab and human complement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combination of these drugs with rituximab induced an additive cytotoxic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, exposure to fludarabine (1 microg/ml for 48-72 h) showed a synergistic effect, with cell lysis increasing from 10% to 20% using fludarabine or rituximab and complement alone to about 70% with both cytotoxic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the mechanism for this synergistic effect showed that fludarabine downmodulates the membrane expression of CD55 (from 96% to 55% positive cells) without significantly altering CD20 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Northern analysis demonstrated that fludarabine induced a general downmodulation of steady state <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels with no change in transcription rate detected in run-off assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study of the effect of fludarabine and rituximab in six freshly isolated B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (B-CLL) samples showed that, in most cases, fludarabine has an additive cytotoxic activity with rituximab and complement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This report gives a rational support for clinical studies with combinations of drugs, including monoclonal antibodies and fludarabine </plain></SENT>
