<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The distinction between mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) and other small B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) is important because <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> has a more aggressive clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In bone marrow (BM) biopsy specimens, this distinction can be particularly difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although cyclin D1 immunostaining and molecular detection of the t(11;14) translocation are highly specific markers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, they fail to detect a proportion of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have recently described that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> typically lacks detectable expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(kip1) protein by immunostaining, which is expressed at high levels in most small B-cell NHL inversely correlated to the proliferation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined whether p27(kip1) immunostaining could be a useful adjunct for the differential diagnosis of small B-cell NHL infiltrates in the BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Trephine BM biopsy specimens of 96 patients, including well-characterized <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> (19 cases), B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (27 cases), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (18 cases), hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (22 cases), and marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (10 cases) as well as 10 reactive BM, including five with benign lymphoid aggregates were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the presence of a t(11;14) translocation involving the major translocation cluster was studied by PCR in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> revealed a strong p27(kip1) nuclear staining in the majority of neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen (78%) cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> were p27(kip1)-negative in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, whereas four cases revealed a weak nuclear positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventeen (77%) cases of hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> were also either completely negative for p27(kip1) or showed a faint positive staining in a minority of the neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nine of 19 cases (47%) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> showed a bcl1 rearrangement involving the major translocation cluster region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that p27(kip1) immunostaining is a valuable additional marker for the differential diagnosis of small B-cell NHL infiltrates in BM biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The reduction or lack of p27(kip1) protein expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, as well as in hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, might be an important event in the pathogenesis of these disorders </plain></SENT>
