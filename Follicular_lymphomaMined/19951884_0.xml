<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In this study, we sought to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of high-dose therapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (autoPBSCT) after rituximab-containing induction chemotherapy with in vivo purging for relapsed or refractory chemosensitive advanced-stage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A rituximab-containing regimen was used as induction chemotherapy and as in vivo purging before PBSC collection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients achieving partial or complete response received a regimen consisting of high-dose melphalan and total-body irradiation (TBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 18 patients with a median age of 45 years were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of previous chemotherapy regimens was 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The principal nonhematologic toxicities were grade 3 febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient experienced pneumocystis <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, 2 developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0006515'>interstitial pneumonitis</z:hpo>, and 1 experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004432'>agammaglobulinemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had complete improvement except for the patient having <z:hpo ids='HP_0004432'>agammaglobulinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Grade 4 toxicities were not observed, and there have been neither treatment-related mortality nor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary malignancy</z:e> to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 4.0 years, the 4-year estimated overall and failure-free survival rates were 100% and 88.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Consolidation of high-dose melphalan and TBI followed by autoPBSCT with in vivo purging is feasible and effective for relapsed or refractory chemosensitive FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Longer follow-up is needed to confirm the role and late toxicities </plain></SENT>
