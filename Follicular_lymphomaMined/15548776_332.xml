<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used gene-expression profiles of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-biopsy specimens obtained at diagnosis to develop a molecular predictor of the length of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Gene-expression profiling was performed on 191 biopsy specimens obtained from patients with untreated follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Supervised methods were used to discover expression patterns associated with the length of survival in a training set of 95 specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A molecular predictor of survival was constructed from these genes and validated in an independent test set of 96 specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Individual genes that predicted the length of survival were grouped into gene-expression signatures on the basis of their expression in the training set, and two such signatures were used to construct a survival predictor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two signatures allowed patients with specimens in the test set to be divided into four quartiles with widely disparate median lengths of survival (13.6, 11.1, 10.8, and 3.9 years), independently of clinical prognostic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry showed that these signatures reflected gene expression by nonmalignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-infiltrating immune cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The length of survival among patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> correlates with the molecular features of nonmalignant immune cells present in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
