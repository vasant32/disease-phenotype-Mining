<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the mechanism of the t(14;18)(q32;q21) chromosomal translocation found in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we examined the structure of both derivative (der) chromosomal breakpoints as well as their germ-line predecessors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We noted that chromosome segment 18q21 was juxtaposed with immunoglobulin heavy (H) chain gene diversity (DH) regions on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five der(18) chromosomes we examined, and we confirmed the juncture with immunoglobulin H-chain gene joining (JH) regions on the der(14) chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the t(14;18) was not fully reciprocal in that chromosome 14 DNA between the DH and JH regions was deleted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, extra <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi>, reminiscent of "N" segments, were present at the der(14) and possibly der(18) junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This indicates that despite the mature B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the t(14;18) occurs during attempted DH-JH joining, the earliest event in immunoglobulin rearrangement in a pre-B-cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our detailed analysis of the germ-line 18q21 region indicated that most breakpoints clustered within a 150-base-pair major breakpoint region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, we found no evidence for evolutionarily conserved immunoglobulin-like recombinational signals at 18q21, arguing against a role for immunoglobulin recombinase in chromosome 18 breakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Instead, a direct repeat duplication of chromosome 18 sequences was discovered at both chromosomal junctures, typical of the repair of a naturally occurring staggered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi> break </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results prompt a translocation model with illegitimate pairing of a staggered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi> break at 18q21 and an immunoglobulin endonuclease-mediated break at 14q32 and with N-segment addition, repair, and ligation to generate der(14) and der(18) chromosomes </plain></SENT>
