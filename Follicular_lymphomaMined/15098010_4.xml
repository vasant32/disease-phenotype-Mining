<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our understanding of the ontology of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (BCL) has been improved by the study of mutational status of IgV(H) and bcl6 genes, but only a few cases of cutaneous BCL have been examined for this status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed IgV(H) and bcl6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in 10 cutaneous BCL, classified as follicular (three primary and one secondary), primary marginal zone (two cases), and diffuse large BCL (three primary and one secondary) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We observed a lower rate (&lt;2%) of IgV(H) mutation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and a preferential usage of V(H)2-70 (one primary follicular and two primary diffuse large BCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fewer than expected replacement mutations in framework regions (FR) were observed in three primary follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs) and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diffuse large BCL, indicating a negative antigen selection pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ongoing mutations were observed in eight of 10 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only two primary FLs and two diffuse large BCL showed bcl6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data support the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> nature of the different cutaneous BCL, and specifically the distinction between cutaneous follicular and marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The biased usage of V(H)2-70, the low rate of replacement mutation in the FR, and the presence of ongoing mutation imply that local antigens could modulate the growth of primary cutaneous BCL </plain></SENT>
