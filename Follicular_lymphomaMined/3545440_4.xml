<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 5- and 10-year actuarial survivals for the entire group of patients are 77% and 63%, respectively, but disease-free survival is only 46% at 5 years and 22% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No significant survival differences were found with various treatment approaches, although a single relapse occurred after 3 years among patients treated with modern combination chemotherapy containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median survivals of approximately 10 years despite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> are characteristic of the majority of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the reproducibility of cytologic diagnosis among follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is known to be variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At this time, it is unclear whether intensive chemotherapy will cure a significant number of FLC patients or novel approaches are necessary as for the other follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
