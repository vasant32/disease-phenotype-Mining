<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 64 cases, 41 showed BCL2 rearrangement involving one of the three breakpoint clusters: 30 in mbr, eight in mcr, and three in vcr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A double rearrangement mbr+vcr was detected in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty cases with bcl-2 protein expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells exhibited no apparent rearrangement, suggesting the possible existence of other mechanisms activating the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, expression of the LMP1 protein, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encoded gene, whose capacity to induce BCL2 has been recently demonstrated, was only found in 2/41 cases in which BCL2 was rearranged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> is not an important mechanism in the activation of BCL2 in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
