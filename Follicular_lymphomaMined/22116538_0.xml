<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> has rarely focused on hormonal factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Higher incidence rates are observed for many <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes in men compared with women suggesting an underlying association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to investigate the association between reproductive factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Epilymph study is a multicenter case-control study carried out in six European countries from 1998 to 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Female cases of mature T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (n = 52), Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 147), and mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (n = 795), including its common subtypes, and their respective controls (n = 1,141) frequency matched by age, gender, and center were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An odds reduction of 29% (95% CI -46 to -6%) was observed for mature T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> for each child increase among parous women and of 13% (95% CI -19 to -7%) for mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>; while no association was observed for Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> subtypes, these associations were found for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (-21%, 95% CI -31 to -9%) and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>; -14%; 95% CI -23 to -3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, no associations were observed with age at first and last pregnancy, and ever use of hormonal contraceptives and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher odds ratios for a short-term use of hormonal contraceptives (&lt;5 years), but not for a long-term use, were observed for mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> compared with never use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data support the hypothesis that increased parity confers a protective effect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Less clearly, our results also indicate that hormonal contraceptives could play a role </plain></SENT>
