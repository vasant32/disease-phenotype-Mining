<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 5'-noncoding region of the BCL-6 gene is even a target for the mutation machinery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Translocations of the BCL-6 gene to heterologous promoters and mutations of its 5'-noncoding regulatory region were reported to be potential mechanisms for deregulating BCL-6 expression and for playing a role in the genesis of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In line with this hypothesis is the observation that B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo>, such as diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, also carry BCL-6 mutations, some of which are recurrently detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e> (cHD) is also derived from B cells with high loads of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> and thus a further candidate for BCL-6 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine the presence and potential role of BCL-6 mutations in cHD, the 5'-noncoding BCL-6 proportion of single Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells from 6 cases of cHD and 6 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-derived cell lines was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> B-cell-derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> cases and cell lines harbored BCL-6 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, both T-cell-derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> cases and cell lines were devoid of BCL-6 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With only one exception, there were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-specific recurrent BCL-6 mutations detected, and BCL-6 protein was absent from the HRS cells of most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, (1) somatic BCL-6 mutations are restricted to cHD cases of B-cell origin, and (2) the BCL-6 mutations represent mostly irrelevant somatic base substitutions without consequences for BCL-6 protein expression and the pathogenesis of cHD </plain></SENT>
