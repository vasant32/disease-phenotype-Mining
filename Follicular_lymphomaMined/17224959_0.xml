<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective case series examined biopsies from 16 consecutive patients with conjunctival lymphoproliferative lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The histopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic features were characterized, as well as the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> type, prognostic implications, clinical features, and treatments offered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diagnosis was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 12 cases, atypical <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> (ALH) in 1 case, and reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> (RLH) in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> consisted of 4 mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (MALTL), 1 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), 2 diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e>), 1 lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 1 T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were treated with radiation (n = 7), surgery (n = 1), and topical chemotherapy (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete remission was achieved in 8 of 9 primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two cases of recurrence to the other conjunctiva were treated with radiation and both remained disease free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> included 2 DLBCL and 1 MALTL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complete remission was seen in 2 patients after radiation plus chemotherapy, while the patient treated with chemotherapy alone was lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 1 case of ALH presented bilaterally and achieved complete remission after topical chemotherapy treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 3 RLH cases were surgically managed and 2 of the 3 recurred and were subsequently excised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Eleven <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were of B-cell lineage by immunophenotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Molecular genetic studies of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed clonal bands in 6 of 12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 1 of 3 RLH (polyclonal by immunophenotyping) and 1 ALH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>BCL2-IgH [t(14;18)] rearrangement was seen in 8 of 12 cases (1 FL, 3 DLBCLs, 4 MALTLs) by real-time quantitative PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Conjunctival <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are predominantly B-cell type with a high prevalence of MALTL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>An unexpected finding was the BCL2-IgH rearrangement seen in 4 of 5 MALTL cases in our series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The significance of this remains unclear </plain></SENT>
