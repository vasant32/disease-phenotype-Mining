<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Excision, histologic study, and culture of the lesion were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the many stained sections, only one revealed endospore-containing spherules within the caseous <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of a granuloma, and only four spherules were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On agar medium the same tissue yielded a fast-growing fungus that produced arthrospores alternating with empty cells, typical of Coccidioides immitis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The arthrospore suspension was inoculated intraperitoneally into a mouse and into a medium of human pleural fluid at 40 C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spherules containing endospores developed in the internal organs of the mouse and in the pleural fluid medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The phylogeny of C. immitis is briefly discussed </plain></SENT>
