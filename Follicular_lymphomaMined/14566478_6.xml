<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To evaluate retrospectively long-term results and patterns of recurrence in patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) Ann Arbor stage I-II and limited stage III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 58 patients, who had been treated between 1980 and 1996, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up period was 8.75 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>48 patients (83%) presented with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (stage I: 23 patients, stage II and III: 15 and ten patients, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median age was 51 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Irradiation was applied with a median total dose of 40 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>13 patients (22%) additionally received chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>End points of the investigation were remission rate, overall- and disease-free survival, and patterns of recurrence, as well as the prognostic impact of age, B-symptoms, chemotherapy, irradiation dose, treatment volume, and Ann Arbor stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 6 weeks after treatment 91% of the patients had complete, 7% partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient (2%) was classified as progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall survival rate was 86% and 69% at 5 and 10 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Corresponding disease-free survival rates were 73% and 63% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Regarding overall survival, multivariate analysis identified age (p = 0.001) as independent prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 92% were found in complete, 6% in partial remission, one patient (2%) with progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Overall survival rates at 5 und 10 years were 87% and 70%, disease-free survival rates 75% and 64%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Out-of-field recurrence rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 58 patients was 34% and the proportion of relapses at nodal or lymphatic sites outside the treated areas in relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> registered recurrences was 77% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results maintain external radiotherapy as a curative concept in the treatment of limited stage low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, especially in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Patterns of recurrence would favor total nodal irradiation (TNI) as an appropriate approach for these patients </plain></SENT>
