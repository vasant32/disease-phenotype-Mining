<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of an immunomagnetic purging method and the Isolex 300 devices were assessed for selecting CD34+ cells from leukapheresis products of 29 patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), 39 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> and 34 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean purity of the CD34+ cell population was 93.6% and the mean recovery was 67.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following enzymatic cleavage by chymopapain the expression of Thy-1 and Leu-8 was significantly reduced without affecting haematological recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The population of selected CD34+ cells of 4/8 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> became PCR-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 2.5 log reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells could be achieved in four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> as shown by a quantitative PCR assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells detectable in any of the 19 CD34+ cell preparations of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 64 patients who received 94 cycles of high-dose therapy, a mean number of 4.7x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg were autografted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The time needed for platelet reconstitution was different when a comparison was made with 156 patients, who had received unmanipulated leukapheresis products (10 v 12 d, P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences with regard to neutrophil recovery were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients had a graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two of them died (on day 78 and 88 following PBSCT), and three patients were rescued with unmanipulated back-up transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the immunomagnetic selection of CD34+ cells provides autografts with reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell content and an engraftment ability similar to that of unmanipulated autografts </plain></SENT>
