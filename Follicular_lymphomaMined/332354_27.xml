<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Rappaport classification system has established its clinical value in distinguishing relatively favorable disease (ie, nodular or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) from relatively unfavorable disease (ie, diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the problems of multiple histologies in a given patient posed by the existence of composite <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and by a spectrum of nodularity in a given node, no newer classification has yet proved superior to the Rappaport system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relative roles of radiotherapy and chemotherapy are reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary role of radiation appears to be the control of detectable disease, when adequate doses and volumes are employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary role of chemotherapy appears to be the eradication of microfoci of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Randomized studies of combined modality approaches have produced no definitive evidence of benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in stage I and II disease of unfavorable histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The addition of adjuvant radiotherapy in stage III and IV disease of unfavorable histologic types appears to produce some improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aggressive treatment regimes have yet to show any significant advantage over more conservative treatment in patients with favorable histologic types of stage IV extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This paper emphasizes the need for expert hematopathologic interpretation in every study of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
