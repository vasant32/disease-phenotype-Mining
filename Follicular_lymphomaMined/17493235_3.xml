<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to investigate the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunophenotype of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) in order to clarify whether FL presenting in inguinal nodes differs from FL biopsies from other sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 219 FLs were studied, comprising 78 biopsy specimens of inguinal lymph nodes and 141 from other sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> samples were assessed for growth pattern, grade, <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> and immunophenotype (Bcl-2, CD10, CD23, Mib-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases negative for Bcl-2 were analysed by polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In comparison with the biopsies from other regions, we found a significantly increased number of CD23+ FLs in samples of inguinal lymph nodes (38% versus 21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of CD23 was more frequently detected in grade 1 FLs than in other grades (grade 1, 37%; grade 2, 18%; grade 3, 23%; transformed, 6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other immunohistochemical parameters, however, did not differ between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is an unexpectedly high frequency of CD23 expression in FL in general, which is even more pronounced in inguinal nodes </plain></SENT>
