<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is recent evidence that the incidence of indolent non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) appears to be increased in persons with the acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study was conducted to describe the clinical, immunologic, and pathologic characteristics of indolent B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in patients infected with the human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The current report was a retrospective study of 10 cases of indolent NHL identified from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Registry at the University of Southern California School of Medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were compared with 336 consecutive patients with systemic intermediate/high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related NHL who were diagnosed and treated at a single institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The pathology of the indolent cases included follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (five patients), small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (two patients), and one case each of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), monocytoid B-cell, and marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When comparing the indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with the intermediate/high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-NHL cases, no differences were observed with regard to demographic characteristics or history of prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">opportunistic infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HIV patients with indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were found to have a significantly higher median CD4+ lymphocyte count compared with patients with intermediate/high-grade NHL (531 /mm3 vs. 90 /mm3) (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow involvement was significantly more common in indolent NHL cases (50%) versus intermediate/high-grade NHL cases (17%) (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median survival for patients with indolent NHL was significantly longer compared with patients with intermediate/high-grade NHL (66.8 months vs. 7.1 months) (P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> occurring in patients infected with HIV appear to differ from intermediate/high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with regard to immune status and propensity for bone marrow involvement and prolonged survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median survival in the group of HIV-seropositive patients with indolent NHL examined in the current study was found to be comparable to that reported in HIV-negative individuals </plain></SENT>
