<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recent studies indicate that mature B lymphocytes may demonstrate significant lineage plasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We and others have reported <z:mpath ids='MPATH_85'>transdifferentiation</z:mpath> of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs) into clonally related histiocytic/dendritic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe 2 patients with FL who developed clonally related Langerhans cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first was a 52-year-old man diagnosed with FL, grade 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He received immunochemotherapy and had stable disease for 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He then developed increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, and lymph node biopsy showed Langerhans cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> with no evidence of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The second patient was a 77-year-old woman who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, an abdominal mass, and pulmonary nodules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lymph node biopsy showed both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_653'>Langerhans cell histiocytosis</z:mpath> and minimal involvement by FL, grade 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In each case, a combination of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and fluorescence in situ hybridization studies provided evidence to support a clonal relationship between the FL and Langerhans cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These cases provide striking examples of neoplastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_85'>transdifferentiation</z:mpath> and expand the spectrum of lesions clonally identical to otherwise typical FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Awareness of this phenomenon may aid in diagnosis when histologically dissimilar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> arise synchronously or metachronously in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
