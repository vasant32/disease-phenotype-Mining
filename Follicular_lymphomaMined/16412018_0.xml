<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, FL Ids are subject to hypermutation and subclones may escape antitumour cytotoxic T-cell response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the intraclonal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> diversity, we sequenced the FL heavy chain gene (consensus Id gene) and subclones of 24 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The derived <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> sequences were analysed by bioinformatics for human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-A0201-restricted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">Epitopes</z:chebi> were classified according to BIMAS and SYFPEITHI scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly in these highly mutated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi>, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> concentrated in short hotspots in the conserved framework regions (FRs), both in HLA-A0201(+) and HLA-A0201(-) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar hotspots have been observed by others in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> Ids which in contrast to FL have low mutation frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FR3 amino acids 78-88 displayed the best-score <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> in Ids containing a VH3-family segment, the most represented in FL Ids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such VH3-FR3(78-88) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> were previously demonstrated as immunogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Modifications of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> pattern in subclones of HLA-A0201(+) patients were generally absent from high-score <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, including VH3-FR3(78-88) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> (83% unmodified) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, no tendency for loss of HLA-A0201-restricted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> was evidenced and, given their limited intraclonal diversity, VH3-FR3(78-88) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> may provide a useful target for the induction of cytotoxic response in Id-vaccinated FL patients </plain></SENT>
