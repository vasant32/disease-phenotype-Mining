<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (n = 1192) were less likely to receive rituximab if they were older, black or Asian, lacked private medical insurance, had impaired performance status, had no <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase measurements or were diagnosed with stage I disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with FL (n = 476) were less likely to receive rituximab if they were unmarried or non-Hispanic white </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Receipt of rituximab did not differ by neighborhood median income </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lower rituximab use in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> without private insurance suggests that previously identified socioeconomic disparities in survival may, in part, be explained by receipt of rituximab </plain></SENT>
