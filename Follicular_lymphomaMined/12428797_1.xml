<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are few data addressing whether the immunophenotypes of SBCNs in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) are representative of those in other tissue sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the immunophenotypic features of concurrently analyzed lymph node (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>) and BM/PB specimens using multiparameter flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five SBCNs were identified: 27 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs), 16 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLLs</z:e>), and 12 mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCLs</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Major (presence vs absence) or minor (alteration of intensity) variations in expression of individual antigens between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> and BM/PB were observed in up to 25% of cases within a particular SBCN category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> FLs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLLs</z:e> maintained characteristic immunophenotypes in BM/PB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Potentially misleading variations included 1 case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> that failed to express CD5 in BM and likely would have been immunophenotypically misclassified as a marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and another <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> that expressed moderate CD23 in PB and would have required additional studies for precise classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining major and minor variations would not have affected interpretation </plain></SENT>
