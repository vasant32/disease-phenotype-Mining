<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report four such cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that were investigated by electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This extracellular material was clearly different from the sclero-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_40'>hyalinosis</z:mpath> commonly found in malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our observations revealed that the material is ultrastructurally composed of membranous structures, membrane-bound vesicles, and electron-dense bodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry confirmed its neoplastic cell origin and its identity with cell membrane antigens (Dako-LC+, anti-B antibodies positive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one case investigated using frozen sections, it showed the same immunophenotype as the neoplastic cells: SB4+ (CD19), SB2+ (CD21), TO15+ (CD22), SB3+ (CD37), IgML+, and Calla+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mechanism for accumulation of this extracellular amorphous material is probably a function of a deregulation of cell wall synthesis and an exocytosis of cell membranes </plain></SENT>
