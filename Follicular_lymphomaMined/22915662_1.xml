<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The optimal management of stage I follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, according to consensus guidelines, is based on uncontrolled experiences of select institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diverse treatment approaches are used despite guidelines that recommend radiation therapy (XRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed outcomes of patients with stage I follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> enrolled onto the National LymphoCare database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 471 patients with stage I follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 206 patients underwent rigorous staging as defined by both a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy and an imaging study (a computed tomography [CT] scan of the whole body, a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography [PET]/CT scan, or both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rigorously staged patients had superior progression-free survival (PFS) compared with nonrigorously staged patients (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatments given to rigorously staged patients were rituximab/chemotherapy (R-chemo; 28%), XRT (27%), observation (17%), systemic therapy + XRT (13%), rituximab monotherapy (12%), and other (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 57 months for PFS, there were 44 progression events (in 21% of patients) for rigorously staged patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For these patients, PFS was significantly improved with either R-chemo or systemic therapy + XRT compared with patients receiving XRT alone after adjustment for histology, LDH, and the presence of B symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this largest, prospectively enrolled group of patients with stage I follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, variable treatment approaches resulted in similar excellent outcomes, which challenges the paradigm that XRT should be standard for this presentation </plain></SENT>
