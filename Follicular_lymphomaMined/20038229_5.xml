<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Associations of NHL and NHL subtypes with polymorphisms and haplotypes in CCR5, CCR2, CCL5, CXCL12, and CX(3)CR(1) were explored in a pooled analysis of three case-control studies (San Francisco Bay Area, California; United Kingdom; total: cases N = 1610, controls N = 1992) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adjusted unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate relative risks among HIV-negative non-Hispanic Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CCR5 Delta32 deletion reduced the risk of NHL (odds ratio = 0.56, 95% confidence interval = 0.38-0.83) in men but not women with similar effects observed for diffuse large-cell and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NHL risk also was reduced in men with the CCR2/CCR5 haplotype characterized by the CCR5 Delta32 deletion </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results should be interpreted conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Continued investigation is warranted to confirm these findings </plain></SENT>
