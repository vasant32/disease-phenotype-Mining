<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The caryotype was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and no contamination with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) could be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These cells did not respond to recombinant gamma interferon or to recombinant human interleukin 2 (IL-2), although they displayed a weak density of IL-2 receptor sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were both responsive to and dependent on BCGF for their multiplication in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the putative receptor for this growth factor (CD23) was detected on these cells and the BCGF-dependent proliferation could be blocked by a monoclonal anti-CD23 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-derived cell line like this provides an interesting model for studying the mechanisms regulating B cell growth and the early events leading to the process of B cell immortalization </plain></SENT>
