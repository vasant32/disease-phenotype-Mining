<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is the most common subtype of indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rituximab is widely used alone or in combination therapy for the treatment of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite its well-established clinical efficacy, a subpopulation of patients does not respond to rituximab and most patients will relapse after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of action and resistance to rituximab are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To study these mechanisms we developed an in vivo model of FL resistant to rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This model was developed using the human RL line, isolated from a patient with FL, grown as xenotransplants in severe combined immunodeficient mice, exposed weekly to rituximab in vivo, followed by serial reimplantation and reexposure to rituximab, until a resistant phenotype was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RL-derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> unexposed to rituximab were grown as controls and compared with the resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the expression of CD46 and CD55 antigens were not differently expressed in the resistant cells, the complement inhibitor CD59 was overexpressed in a subpopulation and CD20 was found to be expressed at a lower level in a minority of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bcl-X(L) and YY1 were also found more highly expressed in rituximab-resistant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This model provides insight on potential in vivo resistance mechanisms to rituximab and could help contribute to the development of novel therapies in rituximab-refractory diseases </plain></SENT>
