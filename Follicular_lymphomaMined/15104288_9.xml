<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore conducted a case-control study (372 cases, 500 controls) to evaluate links with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> risk in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The risk was evaluated in terms of odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) adjusted for age and sex in an unconditional logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical risk change with the Arg/Gln (adjusted OR 0.89; 0.65-1.23, P = 0.492) or the Gln/Gln (0.57; 0.27-1.17, P = 0.127) compared with the Arg/Arg of the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were unchanged in analyses according to histological subtype (diffuse large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, and others) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that XRCC1 Gln399Arg polymorphism plays a limited role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further study on the interaction between the polymorphism and environmental exposure is required </plain></SENT>
