<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the oncogene rearrangements involving BCL2 and MYC in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells of a patient with an aggressive prolymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> that had an abnormal karyotype including a t(14;18) translocation and a chromosome 17q+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis showed that BCL2 was rearranged in the major breakpoint cluster region and had joined into the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene as in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cloning and sequence analysis of the rearranged MYC gene revealed that MYC was truncated at the Pvu II site at the end of the first exon of MYC and had joined into the regulatory elements of a gene that we called BCL3 (B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The BCL3 locus was mapped to chromosome 17 band q22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found BCL3 transcribed as a message of 1.7 kilobases in many hematopoietic cell lines representing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hematopoietic lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells, the truncated MYC gene was highly expressed under the influence of BCL3 regulatory elements, leading to an aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> that presumably had been derived from an indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> carrying a rearranged BCL2 gene </plain></SENT>
