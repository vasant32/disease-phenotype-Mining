<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> was defined as disappearance of t(14;18) (q32;q21) amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-five patients with Stage I to III follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were randomized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLI consisted of the mantle, abdomen, and pelvic radiation fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ATT alternated among CHOD-Bleo, ESHAP, and NOPP for 12 courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples were obtained before treatment for PCR analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PCR-positive patients were followed by PCR analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The random-effects logistic model was fitted to the data from the posttreatment PCRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The factors included in the model were treatment arm, type of PCR (BM vs. PB), and time to PCR sample procurement from the date of registration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 71 months, the 5-year relapse-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) rates were 45% and 54% for CLI and ATT, respectively (p = 0.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The probability of attaining an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> increased with time after registration (p = 0.007), was lower for BM compared with PB (p = 0.012), and was higher for ATT than for CLI (p = 0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ATT regimen achieved a higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> than CLI, although both arms had similar 5-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
