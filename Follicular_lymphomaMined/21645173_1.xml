<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of eight doses of rituximab monotherapy, 52 patients with relapsed or refractory indolent B-NHL were enrolled in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty of 45 eligible patients (89%) had follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 24 (53%) were at intermediate or high risk group according to the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 1 (range 1-7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the median follow-up of 12.2 months, the overall response rate (ORR), complete response rate (%CR), and median progression-free survival (PFS) were 69% (95% confidence interval [CI] 53%-82%), 47% (95% CI 32%-62%), and 15.6 months (95% CI 10.6- months), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 33 patients pretreated with rituximab, the ORR, %CR, and median PFS were inferior compared with values for the 12 patients who had not received rituximab previously (64%vs 83% for ORR; 39%vs 67% for %CR; and 13.8 vs 17.5 months for median PFS, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> mild-to-moderate infusion-related toxicities were reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Grade 3/4 non-hematologic adverse events occurred in six of the 52 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed Grade 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and a decrease (&gt;50%) in serum immunoglobulin was observed in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, rituximab monotherapy with eight weekly infusions is effective in relapsed patients with indolent B-NHL, with acceptable toxicities, including in patients pretreated with rituximab; however, careful monitoring is recommended for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004313'>hypogammaglobulinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
