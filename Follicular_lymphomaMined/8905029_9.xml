<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A wait-and-see policy (WS) does not appear to modify the long-term prognosis of advanced-stage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL), while irradiation of limited stages sometimes causes complications and does not avert distant relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consequently, we decided to test WS in a selected subset of the localized FL, i.e., patients in complete remission (CR) after the initial lymph node biopsy (stage I0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-three previously untreated patients were diagnosed with stage I0 FL and 26 of them were included in the WS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their median age was 60.3 years; 19 were male and 24 female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> histological slides were reviewed and confirmed the diagnosis of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 6.3 years (y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen of the 26 untreated patients are still relapse-free, while six relapsed locally only (median: 4.2 years after diagnosis), and reattained CR with radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven patients relapsed at distant sites (median: 1 year after diagnosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No localized relapses were observed in the treated group, but there were 7 distant relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of WS in stage I0 FL did not appear to modify the prognosis of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we observed two distinct patterns of relapse (local and distant) that are difficult to differentiate at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
