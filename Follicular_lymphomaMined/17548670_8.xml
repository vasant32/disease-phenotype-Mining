<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) comprises a group of <z:mp ids='MP_0002022'>lymphoid tumors</z:mp> that have in common somatic translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>H2AFX encodes a key <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> involved in the detection of the DNA double-stranded breaks that can lead to translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>H2afx is a dosage-dependent gene that protects against B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in mice, making its human orthologue an ideal candidate gene for susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We did a population-based genetic association study of H2AFX variants in 487 NHL cases and 531 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complete resequencing of the human H2AFX gene in 95 NHL cases was done to establish the spectrum of variation in affected individuals; this was followed by both direct and indirect tests for association at the level of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and as haplotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Homozygosity for the AA genotype of a SNP 417 bp upstream of the translational start of H2AFX is strongly associated [odds ratio (OR), 0.54; P = 0.001] with protection from NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We find a strong association of this SNP with the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtype of NHL (AA genotype: OR, 0.40; P = 0.004) and with mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (AA genotype: OR, 0.20; P = 0.01) that remains significant after adjustment for the false discovery rate, but not with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data support the hypothesis that genetic variation in the H2AFX gene influences genetic susceptibility or resistance to some subtypes of NHL by contributing to the maintenance of genome stability </plain></SENT>
