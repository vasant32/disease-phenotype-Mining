<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Increasing incidence of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> have been associated repeatedly with farming occupation and particular attention focused on the role of <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> exposure to potentially explain part of this trend </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A genetic hallmark of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is the presence of recurrent chromosomal translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, the t(14;18), which deregulates BCL2 expression and inhibits <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, is the most frequent in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and has been detected consistently in peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As BCL2-IGH translocation represents an early step of the malignant process, we evaluated the occurrence and molecular characteristics of BCL2-IGH translocation in 56 individuals occupationally exposed to pesticides in open field farming They were selected from a representative cohort of farmers with a well-defined assessment of <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> exposure taking into account potential confounding factors, smoking, sunlight, and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that occupational exposure to pesticides would increase BCL2-IGH prevalence together with the frequency of BCL2-IGH-bearing cells especially during the high <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> use period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Distribution of BCL2 or IGH breakpoint positions seemed to be independent of <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> exposure and was similar to those found in other healthy populations or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, these results provide additional evidence that BCL2-IGH translocation measurements could be a measure of acquired genetic instability in relation to genotoxic exposure in a gene directly relevant in term of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
