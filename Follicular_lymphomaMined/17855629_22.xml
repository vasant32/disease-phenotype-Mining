<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have documented that, in malignant B cells, rituximab elicits a complex and not yet totally understood signaling network contributing to its antitumor effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this context, we investigated the role of protein kinase C zeta (PKCzeta), an atypical PKC isoform, in the cellular response to rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells displayed an increase in PKCzeta expression and activity levels, compared with nonmalignant B cells, and that this enzyme was a critical regulator of the classical MAPK module by stimulating Raf-1 kinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PKCzeta appeared to be a significant contributor of abnormal mTOR regulation in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells through a MAPK-dependent mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rituximab was found to inhibit the PKCzeta/MAPK/mTOR module in these cells but not in other B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the expression of a constitutively active form of PKCzeta resulted in an efficient protection of these cells toward rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Altogether, our study describes a new regulatory component of mTOR pathway in follicular cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and demonstrates that PKCzeta is a target for rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, PKCzeta could represent an important parameter for rituximab efficacy and a promising target for future targeted therapy in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
