<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies have shown that the Igh 3' enhancers deregulate the Bcl2 expression in vitro </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of the Igh 3' enhancers in Bcl2 deregulation, we used gene targeting to generate knock-in mice in which four DNase I-hypersensitive regions from the murine Igh 3' region were integrated 3' of the Bcl2 locus </plain></SENT>
