<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The transcription factor PU.1 has been shown to be crucial for the early stages of B cell development but its function at later stages of B cell development is less well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We observed previously that PU.1 is expressed uniformly throughout the mature pre-plasma cell B cell population, the only exception being a subpopulation of germinal centre (GC) cells which showed exceptionally high expression of PU.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This suggested that PU.1 may also have a role in GC B cell biology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis and to screen for possible genes regulated by PU.1, we first evaluated semi-quantitatively the possible co-expression of PU.1 with proteins known to be upregulated or downregulated during GC B cell development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> lymphoid tissues and 255 B cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of putative GC B cell origin were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PU.1 expression was positively associated with CD10 (p &lt; 0.0001), CD20 (p = 0.043), CD22 (p = 0.005), CD79a (p = 0.024) and Bcl-6 (p &lt; 0.0001) and negatively associated with cytoplasmic immunoglobulin light-chain expression (p = 0.036) in diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Identical or nearly identical associations were found in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since CD20 is known to be partly regulated by PU.1 and putative PU.1-binding sites have been described in the regulatory regions of the CD22, CD79a and CD10 genes, we looked for putative PU.1 binding sites in the BCL6 promotor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four such putative PU.1 binding sites were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further analysis by gel-shift electromobility essay showed that PU.1 protein binds to three of the four putative binding sites in the BCL6 promotor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PU.1 and Bcl-6 were also found to be upregulated in centroblasts in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GC, but jointly downregulated in a subpopulation of centrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the contention that PU.1 may also have an important role in GC B cell development </plain></SENT>
