<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy and toxicity of external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to sites of bulky <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> in patients with chemotherapy-refractory low-grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) immediately before receiving Bexxar (tositumomab and (131)I) vs. in patients receiving Bexxar alone for nonbulky disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nineteen patients with chemotherapy-refractory NHL were treated with Bexxar at our institution (University of Florida, Gainesville, FL) from 2005 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients had Grade 1-2 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients received a median of 20 Gy in 10 fractions to the areas of clinical involvement, immediately followed by Bexxar (EBRT + Bexxar); 9 patients received Bexxar alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sizes before EBRT + Bexxar and Bexxar alone were 4.8 cm and 3.3 cm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 5 patients with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> diameter &gt;5 cm were treated with EBRT + Bexxar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A univariate analysis of prognostic factors for progression-free survival (PFS) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median follow-up was 2.3 years for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and 3.1 years for 12 patients alive at last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, 79% had a partial or complete response; 4 of the 8 responders in the EBRT + Bexxar group achieved a durable response of over 2 years, including 3 of the 5 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> &gt;5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three of 9 patients treated with Bexxar alone achieved a durable response over 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Actuarial estimates of 3-year overall survival and PFS for EBRT + Bexxar and Bexxar alone were 69% and 38% and 62% and 33%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median time to recurrence after EBRT + Bexxar and Bexxar alone was 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Having fewer than 4 involved lymph-node regions was associated with superior PFS at 3 years (63% vs. 18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no Grade 4 or 5 complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adding EBRT immediately before Bexxar produced PFS equivalent to that with Bexxar alone, despite bulkier disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Hematologic toxicity was not worsened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>EBRT combined with Bexxar adds a safe and effective therapeutic treatment for managing recurrent low-grade follicular NHL </plain></SENT>
