<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The classification of primary cutaneous large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (PCLBCL) is based on standard <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, immunohistochemistry, and clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are two major subtypes in the current WHO-EORTC classification: follicle center <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, leg-type (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>-LT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goals of this study were to examine a series of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> to determine (1) whether the immunohistochemical paradigm of germinal center B-cell and non-germinal center B-cell types of systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> could be applied to PCLBCL; (2) whether application of the newly described germinal center B-cell marker, human germinal center-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (HGAL) also discriminates between these types as a further support for germinal center B-cell origin for primary cutaneous center <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; and (3) whether any of these biologic markers were of prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To this end, 32 cases of diffuse PCLBCL (22 primary cutaneous follicular center <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 10 DLBCL-LT) were classified based on the WHO-EORTC criteria and studied for expression of CD20, BCL2, BCL6, CD10, MUM-1, and HGAL by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were correlated with clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HGAL and BCL6 expression and germinal center B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> were associated with primary cutaneous follicular center <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combination of HGAL and BCL6 positivity had the highest sensitivity (88%) and specificity (100%) for predicting subtype compared to either marker alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both HGAL and BCL6 were associated with the germinal center B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The correlation of HGAL expression with the germinal center B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> demonstrates the role of this marker in the classification of cutaneous large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BCL6 expression was the only immunohistochemical marker associated with overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Characterizing PCLBCLs with markers of B-cell maturation stage is a useful framework for studying, classifying, and clinically stratifying these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
