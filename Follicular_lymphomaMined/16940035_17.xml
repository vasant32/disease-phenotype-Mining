<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to analyze incidence and risk factors for HT in a large series of FL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 276 patients (median age: 54 years; M139/F137) diagnosed with FL (42% grade 1, 51% 2, 7% 3) in a single institution were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial treatment consisted of combined chemotherapy in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 11.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Main clinic and biological variables were assessed for HT and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 30 of 276 patients (11%) presented HT after a median follow-up of 6.5 years, with a risk of 15% and 22% at 10 and at 15 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> HT corresponded to diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 histology, nodal areas &gt;4, increased LDH and beta(2)-microglobulin, and high-risk IPI and FLIPI were associated with HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, grade 3 histology and FLIPI retained prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only FLIPI predicted HT in grade 1-2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>28 patients received salvage treatment for HT, with a CR rate of 52% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Median survival from transformation was 1.2 years, with 6/13 CR patients being alive &gt;5 years after HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FLIPI and histology were the most important variables predicting HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Upon HT, only patients achieving CR reached prolonged survival, thus emphasizing the need for effective therapies once this event occurs </plain></SENT>
