<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-one patients with previously untreated follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> received rituximab for 4 consecutive weeks, followed by 3 cycles of rituximab combined with either CHOP (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>; 88%) or CVP (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>/ <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>; 12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To complete treatment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients received 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan 4-6 weeks after the final dose of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy endpoint was the clinical complete response (CR) rate after completion of therapy; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were followed for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After completion of short-course rituximab/chemotherapy, 95% had objective responses, with a 30% clinical CR rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical CR rate increased to 72% following 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 67 months, the estimated 5-year PFS and OS rates are 64% and 96%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reversible grade 3/4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> occurred in 39% and 36% of the patients, respectively, following 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan; nonhematologic toxicity was uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan was well tolerated after short-course rituximab/chemotherapy and resulted in a high CR rate and a long PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Definitive demonstration of improved efficacy versus rituximab/chemotherapy alone will require a randomized phase III trial </plain></SENT>
