<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Miyagi Study is an epidemiological study of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, including immunological and genetic analyses, constructed by a population-based registration system covering Miyagi prefecture, Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 1,552 newly diagnosed cases in Miyagi between 2002 and 2008 were enrolled in this study; 75% were B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 19% were T-cell and natural killer-cell (T/NK-cell) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and 5% were Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most frequent subtype of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, followed by follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (51%, 24% and 8%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> accounts for 18.2% of newly diagnosed cases in Miyagi; unexpectedly, its frequency is similar to that reported in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The common subtypes of T/NK-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, angioimmunoblastic T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and adult T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (30%, 15% and 14%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most of the data are similar to those reported in Asian countries, except for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed the CD20 expression in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> by flow cytometry for the cell membrane expression and by immunohistochemistry for the cytoplasmic expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cell membrane expression of CD20 protein may determine the susceptibility of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> to anti-CD20 antibody therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lack of CD20 expression was confirmed by both methods in 4 cases of 585 newly diagnosed cases (0.7%) and in 5 of 67 recurrent cases (7.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 23 cases (6.5%) showed the discrepancy of CD20 expression between both methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Miyagi Study has revealed the latest epidemiological features of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Japan </plain></SENT>
