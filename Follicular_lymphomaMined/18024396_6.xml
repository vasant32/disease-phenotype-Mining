<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although serum beta2 microglobulin (beta2 M) is an easy parameter to measure, and over-expressed in a large number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative diseases</z:e>, its prognostic value has been largely underestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the influence of beta2M levels on overall survival (OS) of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: The prognostic role of beta2M was evaluated in 236 patients with FL identified from the databases of the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio dei Linfomi (GISL) and treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based regimens from 1993 to 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Elevated serum beta2M levels were found in 82 patients (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to multivariate logistic regression analysis, elevated beta2M levels were associated with elevated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) (p=0.021), age (p=0.029), and number of involved nodal areas (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of elevated beta2M levels increased progressively with increasing FLIPI scores (17%, 38%, and 63% in the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five-year OS was 61% (95% CI, 47-73%) and 89% (95% CI, 82-93%) for patients with elevated vs <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> beta2M levels respectively (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis showed that beta2M level had an independent and stable prognostic value (HR=3.0; 95%CI, 1.6-5.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis the impact of beta2M level on survival was independent of FLIPI score, with a HR of 2.94 (95% CI, 1.54-5.62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that in patients treated in the pre-rituximabera, beta2M level was an independent prognostic marker in addition to FLIPI score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We thus suggest that beta2M be routinely assessed and tested in future prognostic studies of FL patients treated with combination chemotherapy and anti-CD20 agents </plain></SENT>
