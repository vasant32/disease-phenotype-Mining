<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>During the past decade, considerable advances have been made in the sensitivity of detection of residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays are capable of detecting one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell in as many as 106 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The applicability of these techniques has been made possible by the identification and cloning of the breakpoints associated with specific chromosomal translocations associated with particular subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, best studied for the t(14;18), which occurs in most cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although we are approaching the time when PCR-based methods of detection of minimal residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> detection become a routine part of staging, both at diagnosis and after therapy, it is not yet possible to determine whether the detection of residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells by PCR is an indication to continue therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, although these techniques provide a useful adjunct to standard methods of detection and diagnosis, their role in staging of disease outcome remains investigational </plain></SENT>
