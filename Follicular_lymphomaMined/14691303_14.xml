<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previously we showed reduced protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of the SHP1 gene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines and patient specimens by Northern blot, RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, aberrant methylation in the SHP1 gene promoter was detected in many B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines as well as in patient specimens, including diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (methylation frequency 93%), MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (82%), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (75%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> (100%) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (96%) by methylation-specific PCR, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing, and restriction enzyme-mediated PCR analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The methylation frequency was significantly higher in high-grade MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases (100%) than in low-grade MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases (70%), which correlated well with the frequency of no expression of SHP1 protein in high-grade (80%) and low-grade MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (54%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It suggests that the SHP1 gene silencing with aberrant CpG methylation relates to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SHP1 protein expression was recovered in B-cell lines after the treatment of the demethylating reagent: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transfection of the intact SHP1 gene to the hematopoietic cultured cells, which show no expression of the SHP1 gene, induced growth inhibition, indicating that gene silencing of the SHP1 gene by aberrant methylation plays an important role to get the growth advantage of the malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The extraordinarily high frequency (75 to 100%) of CpG methylation of the SHP1 gene in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patient specimens indicates that the SHP1 gene silencing is one of the critical events to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> as well as important implications for the diagnostic or prognostic markers and the target of gene therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data support the possibility that the SHP1 gene is one of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes </plain></SENT>
