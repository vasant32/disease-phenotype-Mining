<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Results from studies of smoking and non-Hodgkin lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (NHL) are inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed whether this inconsistency might be due to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> nature of the disease, to different relationships in subpopulations such as gender, or to chance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined cigarette smoking status, initiation, intensity, and duration in relation to the risk of NHL, and subtypes of NHL in men and women from the American <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Society <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From 1992 to 2007, 1,926 NHL cases were identified among 152,958 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extended Cox regression was used to compute multivariable rate ratios (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The RR (95 % CI) for current smoking associated with NHL incidence in women was 1.37 (1.04-1.81) and in men was 0.88 (0.65-1.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among current smokers, there was a positive relationship between years smoked and risk of NHL in women (p-trend &lt; 0.01), but no association in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In women, the positive associations with current smoking were strongest for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (RR 2.13, 95 % CI 1.20-3.77) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocyte <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (RR 1.75, 95 % CI 1.03-2.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In men and women combined, current smoking was associated with an increased risk of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and a decreased risk of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study supports an association of current smoking with risk of NHL that varies by gender and subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future studies should focus on differences by gender and disease subtype to better clarify the smoking and NHL relationship </plain></SENT>
