<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study explored the association between dietary <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The multiethnic cohort (MEC) includes more than 215 000 Caucasians, African Americans, Native Hawaiians, Japanese Americans and Latinos, aged 45-75 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 10 years of follow-up, 939 incident NHL cases were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk was estimated using proportional hazards' models adjusted for possible confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">Vitamin D</z:chebi> intake was not associated with NHL risk in the entire cohort (P(trend) = 0.72 for men and P(trend) = 0.83 for women), but significantly lowered disease risk in African American women (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.50, 95 % CI: 0.28, 0.90, P(trend) = 0.03) and was borderline protective in African American men (HR = 0.68; 95 % CI: 0.39, 1.19; P(trend) = 0.31) when the highest to the lowest tertile was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In NHL subtype analyses, a 19, 36 and 32 % lowered risk, although not significant, was observed for diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> in women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High dietary intake of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> did not show a protective effect against NHL within the MEC except among African Americans, possibly because <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> production due to sun exposure is limited in this population </plain></SENT>
