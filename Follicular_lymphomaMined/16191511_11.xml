<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of routine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques in detecting t(14;18) in paraffin-embedded tissue samples was compared on 5 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tonsils and 28 FLs demonstrated to be t(14;18)+ by previous karyotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was technical failure in 14 (50%) of the FLs by PCR, likely due to B-5 fixation, and 4 (14%) of FLs by FISH, likely due to advanced specimen age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the remaining successful cases, 5 (36%) of 14 were positive by PCR and 24 (100%) of 24 were positive by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 5 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tonsils were negative by both methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FISH is superior to PCR for detecting t(14;18) from paraffin-embedded tissue samples because it is more sensitive and equally specific </plain></SENT>
