<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">Yttrium</z:chebi>-90((90)Y)-ibritumomab tiuxetan ((90)Y-IT, Zevalin(Â®), Y2B8) has documented efficacy for both indolent and aggressive NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients considered eligible for (90)Y-IT treatment should satisfy several screening criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A recently completed randomized study for patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has demonstrated that (90)Y-ibritumomab consolidation also produced a marked prolongation of the median time to progression from 13.5 to 37 months, while partial responders seem to derive relatively more benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other published and ongoing studies explore a similar use for patients with aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Studies are comparing the use of (90)Y-IT consolidation with the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab maintenance, which is also gaining acceptance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the documented benefit of radioimmunotherapy should be viewed in the context of the goals of treatment and the changing standards of care for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
