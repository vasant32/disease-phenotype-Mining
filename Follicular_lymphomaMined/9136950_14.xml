<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was used to analyse 34 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>27 samples showed DNA sequence copy number changes of at least one genomic region (26 samples with at least one gain and nine with at least one loss) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some chromosomes or chromosomal regions were preferentially involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most frequently gained regions were chromosome 18q (29% of samples), chromosome X (21%), chromosome 7 (18%), chromosomes 2, 6p and 8q (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two regions were preferentially lost: 6q (12%) and 17p (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these gained and lost regions have been previously reported in cytogenetic studies, confirming the accuracy of CGH in detecting genetic abnormalities in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>21% of samples displayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> profiles, probably reflecting the absence of unbalanced abnormality, which is also in agreement with the cytogenetic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we showed that CGH is an accurate, reliable and rapid method and we propose the inclusion of CGH in the evaluation of FL at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
