<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fludarabine has the highest single-agent response rates in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, fludarabine-based combination chemotherapy regimens have been associated with significant myelotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data exist suggesting that the best way to combine partially non-cross-resistant agents may be to use them sequentially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with bulky stage II, stage III, or stage IV follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (grade I or II) were entered on this protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with 3 cycles of fludarabine followed by 6-8 cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CNOP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Response was assessed after the 3(rd) cycle of fludarabine and after the 4(th), 6(th), and 8(th) cycles of CNOP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients were entered on the protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 50 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients (67%) attained a complete response (CR), and eight patients (30%) attained a partial response (PR), for an overall response rate of 97% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median relapse-free survival was 34 months, and median overall survival was not reached for the entire cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who achieved only PR progressed, more than half of those in CR remain free of progression at 39-84 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The regimen was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The sequential combination of fludarabine and CNOP appears to be active and well tolerated in patients with grade I and II follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients who achieve CR fare best, and many remain disease-free long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>While these results are encouraging, the addition of other active agents such as rituximab to this regimen may further enhance efficacy and is under investigation </plain></SENT>
