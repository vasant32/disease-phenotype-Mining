<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent reports have divided diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) into germinal centre B cell-like and activated B cell-like subgroups with implicated differences in prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To delineate the germinal centre B cell derivation group from an Asian series of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty four cases were analysed by polymerase chain reaction to detect the t(14;18) translocation and immunohistochemistry for BCL2, CD10, BCL6, and E2F1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen of 54 cases had bcl2 gene rearrangement, 36 of 52 expressed BCL2, 29 of 52 expressed BCL6, 20 of 53 expressed CD10, and 18 of 53 expressed E2F1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association between bcl2 gene rearrangement and the expression of both BCL2 and CD10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using the minimally acceptable criteria of t(14;18) rearrangement and/or CD10 expression, 26 of 54 cases were probably germinal centre derived, in agreement with other reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A higher proportion of cases had t(14;18) translocation, suggesting that they may be derived from transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>E2F1 positivity did not correlate with the known germinal centre markers, even though it has recently been suggested that it may be a new GC marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It may be possible to stratify patients for treatment using markers for specific lineages of B cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
