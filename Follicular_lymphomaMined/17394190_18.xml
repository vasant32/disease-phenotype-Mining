<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether new treatment modalities have improved the survival of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some data show that there has been no improvement in survival in the last 3 decades of the 20th century, whereas the results of recent retrospective studies suggest that evolving therapy has improved the outcome for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To evaluate the impact of evolving therapies for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, particularly the introduction of rituximab, the overall survival (OS), failure-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e>), and survival after recurrence (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SAR</z:e>) was analyzed in 438 advanced-stage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients enrolled in consecutive Gruppo Italiano Studio Linfomi (GISL) trials between 1988 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A stepwise improvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> and a significant reduction in the hazard ratio was observed with succeeding studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis showed an improvement over time for OS, with a decline in the hazard ratio particularly evident in the group treated with rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SAR</z:e> significantly improved in the group of patients treated with chemotherapy + rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters with an impact on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> and OS, the results of multivariate analysis suggest that rituximab therapy has a favorable effect on the prognosis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data show that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> and OS have significantly improved in advanced-stage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients treated on GISL protocols during the last 18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These improvements are related to evolving front-line and salvage therapies, particularly the introduction of rituximab in combination with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
