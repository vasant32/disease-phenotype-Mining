<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The surface antigens expressed by the cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) are well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most CLL are monoclonal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> characterized by the coexpression of B-cell antigens and CD5, an antigen present predominantly on T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Very little attention, however, has been paid to the quantitative characteristics of the expression of B-cell antigens in CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used flow cytometry to analyze the expression of CD20, a well-known B-cell-associated antigen, in lymphocytes from 42 cases of CLL and its tissue counterpart, small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>), and compared the results with results obtained from the analysis of 21 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 20 hyperplastic reactive nodes, and 26 samples of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intensity of CD20 expression in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e> cells was significantly lower than that of B cells in the other categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This antigen expression abnormality does not appear to be a universal phenomenon in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e>, since CD19, another pan-B antigen, was expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e> at levels higher than those in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and comparable to those in reactive lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the low CD20 expression can be used as a marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The few cases exhibiting intense CD20 expression may represent a biologically different disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e> cells faintly expressing CD20 also show concomitant low CD5 expression in a manner not observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD5-expressing B cells </plain></SENT>
