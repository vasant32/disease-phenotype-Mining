<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight relapsing follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) patients were submitted to CD34+ autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received at least two front line conventional therapies; mean time to treatment failure (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi>) was 4.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients had disseminated stage III-IV disease after a median number of 2.1 relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy and G-CSF were used as mobilization for leukapheresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CEPRATE SC concentrator (CellPro, Inc, Bothell, WA) was used to select CD34+ cells from leukapheresis products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With a mean of 1.8 leukaphereses per patient, 8.1 x 10(8) mononuclear cells (MNCs)/kg were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After the selection process, the median number of MNCs was 9.4 x 10(6)/kg; 4.3 x 10(6)/kg CD34+ cells and 17 x 10(4)/kg CFU-GM, with a purity of 83.7% and a viability of 89.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mbr bcl2/IgH PCR analysis of 5 grafts showed that initial buffy-coat, and CD34- fractions were negative in 3 cases and positive in 2 cases (from whom selected CD34+ fraction remained positive in 1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a conditioning regimen including total body irradiation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, CD34+ selected cells were reinfused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients but one had successful engraftment, median time to WBC &gt; 1 x 10(9)/l was 12 days and platelets &gt; 50 x 10(9)/l 17 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No severe infectious complications were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After transplant, with a minimum follow up of 2 years, 5 patients are still in complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three patients have relapsed after 1 year of transplant with a mean <z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi> of 15.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We conclude that PBSC CD34+ selection for ASCT was a safe technique, capable of reconstituting hemopoiesis without severe complications for high risk FL patients included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell purging need to be evaluated in a larger series </plain></SENT>
