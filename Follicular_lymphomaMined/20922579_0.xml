<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is the predominant site for primary extranodal non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL), accounting for 5-10% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> extranodal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE: A 74-year-old man underwent colonoscopy for a positive fecal occult blood test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy revealed a 3.5-cm <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> in the descending colon and was removed by snare cautery polypectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Post-polypectomy site showed a 0.3-0.5-cm mucosal defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five endoclips were applied to close the mucosal defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient remained stable during subsequent intensive monitoring and never required surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pathology of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> revealed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) involving the lamina propria of the mucosa with extension into the submucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient had no systemic symptoms, and staging for NHL with contrast computerized tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed no evidence suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Approximately 6-20% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> primary GI-NHL are in the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of GI-FL accounts for 1-3.6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> GI-NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After a search of the current literature, there have been no cases of a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> presenting solely as an isolated colon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Likewise, bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> due to polypectomy of such <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> has never been cited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Retrospectively, the diagnosis and extent of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> could have been established using endoscopic end-to-end forceps biopsy and/or endoscopic ultrasound with a radial scanning catheter probe and fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Such a diagnosis could have changed the strategy for endoscopic removal of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our case is interesting because it is the first report of a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> presenting as a single isolated colon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> involving <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> layers of the colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
