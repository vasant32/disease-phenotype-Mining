<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deviations in the flux of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> due to genetic variation could result in selective growth and genomic instability and affect susceptibility to various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, genetic polymorphisms in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> metabolic pathway were investigated using DNA from a population-based case-control study of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) conducted in the San Francisco Bay Area between 1988 and 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The polymorphisms examined and haplotypes generated included thymidylate synthase (TYMS 28-bp triple repeat [3R]--&gt;double repeat [2R], 1494del6, IVS6 -68C&gt;T, 1122A&gt;G, and 1053C&gt;T); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="12071">5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR 677C&gt;T and 1298A&gt;C); serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT1 C1420T); reduced <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> carrier (RFC G80A); and methionine synthase (MTR A2756G), making the present study the largest and most comprehensive to date to evaluate associations between genetic polymorphisms in folatemetabolizing genes and NHL risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The TYMS 6 base pair (bp)(-)6bp- (homozygous for 6bp deletion), IVS6 -68C&gt;T, and 1053C&gt;T genotypes (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in complete linkage disequilibrium) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> inversely associated with NHL (TYMS; odds ratio [OR] = 0.57; 0.34-0.94), particularly with diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL; OR = 0.29; 0.10-0.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, the MTR 2756AG/GG and the MTHFR 677TT genotypes were associated with increased risk for NHL (OR = 1.3; 0.99-1.7) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL; OR = 1.8; 0.98-3.1), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We did not observe any significant differences in genotype frequencies of the SHMT1 and RFC polymorphisms between the cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The associations of DLCL and FL with TYMS 1494del6 and MTHFR 677TT genotypes, respectively, suggest that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> metabolism may play an important role in the pathogenesis of specific subtypes of NHL </plain></SENT>
