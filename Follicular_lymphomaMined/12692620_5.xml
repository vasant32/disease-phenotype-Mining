<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The indolent non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are theoretically curable through allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The applicability of standard conditioning allo-HSCT is, however, restricted by its toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, reduced-intensity conditioning regimens have demonstrated efficacy with significantly reduced early morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the safety and efficacy of rituximab-BEAM-CAMPATH as reduced-intensity conditioning for allo-HSCT in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">Minimal residual disease</z:e> was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for bcl-2/IgH translocations, and chimerism by X,Y-FISH or PCR amplification of short tandem repeat sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 521 days (371-719), four of five patients were alive and three were in complete molecular remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients required pre-emptive treatment for CMV reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One succumbed to a perforated viscus and one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A graft-versus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> effect was demonstrable and quantitative PCR for bcl-2/IgH may allow better accuracy in scheduling post-allograft rituximab and/or donor lymphocyte infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although follow-up is short, reduced-intensity allo-HSCT with BEAM-CAMPATH conditioning appears to be safe, effective in inducing a molecular remission and is potentially curative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further recruitment and much longer follow-up will be necessary to determine if this impacts favourably upon disease-free and overall survival </plain></SENT>
