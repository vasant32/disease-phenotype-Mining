<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients &gt;60 years were assigned successively to eight treatment cycles (Dose level 1: low F, low CV [n=4]; 2A: high F, low CV [n=8]; 2B: low F, high CV [n=4]; 3: high F, high CV [n=7]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High and low levels were: F, 25 and 20mg/m(2), respectively (Days 1-5); C, 750 and 500 mg/m(2), respectively (Day 1); and V, 1.4 and 1mg/m(2), respectively (Day 1) </plain></SENT>
