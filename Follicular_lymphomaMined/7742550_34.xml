<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The LAZ3 gene encodes a novel zinc-finger protein that shares homology with several Drosophila transcription factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This gene was identified by its disruption in translocations involving chromosome 3q27 in diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess the frequency and role of this gene's involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e>, we examined a series of 170 cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of B-cell lineage for LAZ3 gene rearrangement, expression, and mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cases included 35 de novo diffuse aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DAL; 19 large-cell, 4 mixed-cell, and 12 large-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e>), 52 transformed aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> derived from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (TFL), 42 indolent follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL), 14 mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>), and 27 small noncleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (SNCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LAZ3 rearrangements were found in 10 DAL (28.6%), 9 TFL (17.3%), and 6 FL (14.3%), but not in any of the SNCL or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LAZ3 rearrangement was not exclusive of bcl-2 rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most rearrangement breakpoints mapped to a 10-kb BamHI-Xba I fragment located 5' to the LAZ3 coding sequence, consistent with previously reported breakpoint locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Northern analysis of both rearranged and nonrearranged B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases showed similar levels of a transcript of approximately 3.8 kb, indicating that LAZ3 is broadly expressed in B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and is not confined to rearranged cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether mutation of the LAZ3 gene might contribute to a potential role for this gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e>, we screened the coding sequences of 13 rearranged cases, 6 nonrearranged cases, and 13 hematopoietic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although three probable polymorphisms were identified, mutations were detected in only 2 rearranged cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only 1 of these resulted in an amino acid substitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two cell lines (SU-DHL4 and Molt-4) also contained mutations; only one resulted in an amino acid substitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude (1) that LAZ3 rearrangements occur in a significant fraction of de novo DAL as well as in a smaller subset of indolent and transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; (2) that LAZ3 message is expressed in both rearranged and nonrearranged B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; and (3) that mutation of the LAZ3 gene does not contribute to its putative oncogenic role in most 3q27 translocated B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
