<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 36-year-old man, who had been diagnosed as extended follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, presented with a polymorphous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin eruption</z:e> of the trunk, sclera <z:hpo ids='HP_0000509'>conjunctivitis</z:hpo>, and severe mucosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> of the lips and oral cavity </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, 3 courses of rituximab and CHOP therapy, which exert a partial response with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lesions, did not prove effective for oral <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030807" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pemphigus</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because it is known that PNP refractory to long-term steroid and cytoreductive therapy has a progressive character and poor prognosis, supportive care would be warranted for these patients </plain></SENT>
