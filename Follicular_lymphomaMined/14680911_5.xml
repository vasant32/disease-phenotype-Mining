<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we attempted to diagnose malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> on the basis of magnetic resonance imagings (MRIs) and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighteen lesions (in eight patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which had been proven histopathologically, were detected on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The eight patients included five patients with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, one with B-cell low-grade MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, one with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and one with Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine lesions were located in the submandibular region, three in the buccal region, two in the orbit region, two in the submental region, and one each in the palatal and tonsil regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the lesions ranged between 9 and 42.2 mm (average: 22.4 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The signal intensities (SIs) of the 18 lesions were examined on T1-weighted (T1WI), T2WI, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35778">gadopentetate</z:chebi> (Gd)-T1WI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One lesion in case 8 was excluded from DCE-MRI findings, i.e., the regions of interest could not be adequately set on DCE-MRIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The contrast index (CI) curves of the remaining 17 lesions were prepared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 18 lesions showed almost the same images on T1WI, T2WI, and Gd-T1WI, although they represented four types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The images showed homogeneous SI that was intermediate to slightly high SI on T1WI, slightly high SI on T2WI, and moderately enhanced on Gd-T1WI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the cases of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in this study showed relatively characteristic features based on MRI; however, these features might be non-specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The CI curves in this study showed a relatively rapid increase, reaching a maximum CI at 45-120 s, and a relatively rapid decrease in most lesions (14/17; 82.4%); on the other hand, the curves of 3 of the 15 lesions (17.6%) showed relatively rapid increase, sustenance of a plateau, and a gradual decrease thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These patterns of CI curves may indicate characteristic features useful for distinguishing malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> from other lesions </plain></SENT>
