<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients in the first two decades of life fared comparably with adults, but those over 60 years of age showed a poorer survival trend </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven favorable and four unfavorable histopathologic groups were found with collective median survivals of 83 and 16 months, respectively (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The favorable group included three follicular classes (cleaved, mixed, and large noncleaved) and four diffuse classes (small lymphocytic, cleaved, Burkitt non-cleaved, and convoluted lymphocytic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The unfavorable group consisted of four diffuse classes (plasmacytoid lymphocytic, mixed, and small and large non-cleaved) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The group of 88 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had significantly longer overall survival than the group of 143 patients with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in survival were noted within three grades of follicular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The favorable and unfavorable diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had collective median survivals of 82 and 16 months, respectively (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant survival differences due to pattern of nodal involvement (P = 0.01) were found in patients with mixed and large non-cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, but not in those with cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The group with large cleaved cells had significantly longer survival than those with large non-cleaved cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with mixed and large non-cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the same nodal pattern had similar survival data </plain></SENT>
