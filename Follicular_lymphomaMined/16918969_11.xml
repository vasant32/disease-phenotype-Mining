<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, cases of t(14;18)(q32;q21)-positive primary cutaneous FL (PCFL) and examples of t(14;18)(q32;q21)-negative FL at nodal and other extranodal sites, are well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that there is a subtype of FL lacking t(14;18)(q32;q21), which preferentially involves certain sites but is not restricted by anatomical location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A cohort of 47 stage 1 FL was stratified according to the presence or absence of t(14;18)(q32;q21) using conventional cytogenetics, polymerase chain reaction and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with t(14;18)(q32;q21)-positive cases, FL lacking the translocation were less likely to express CD10 or bcl-2 (P&lt;0.01), made up a significantly greater proportion of cases arising at extranodal sites (P&lt;0.001) and had a significantly better overall and disease-specific 5-year survival (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results support the concept of a subtype of FL lacking t(14;18)(q32;q21), characterized by low-intensity bcl-2 expression, a predilection for extranodal sites, particularly the skin, and a more favourable outcome than t(14;18)(q32;q21)-positive FL </plain></SENT>
