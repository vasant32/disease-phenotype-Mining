<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have compared both methods in blood and bone marrow samples of 28 patients enrolled in a clinical study on immunochemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 42% of samples, the bcl2-IgH rearrangement was detectable by nested PCR, but not by LightCycler PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nested PCR was able to reveal a significant drop in positive bone marrow or peripheral blood samples after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, with LightCycler PCR, the detected drop in t(14;18)-positive cells did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients showed positive results with nested PCR of peripheral blood or bone marrow without any associations to presence or absence of histological bone marrow (BM) infiltration by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With LightCycler PCR, the numbers of positive cells were higher in samples from patients with BM infiltration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (1.9 x 10(-2)) compared to samples from patients without involvement (4.08 x 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A similar trend was seen in samples derived from the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Positivity for t(14;18) after therapy in two patients correlated with clinical relapse 6 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data shown here demonstrate a lower sensitivity of LightCycler vs. nested PCR for detection of t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of nested PCR for t(14;18) for risk stratification after primary therapy has to be validated in larger trials </plain></SENT>
