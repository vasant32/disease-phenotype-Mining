<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> occasionally arise in the extra-nodal organs and are frequently found in the duodenum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are often localised <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> with multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> around the ampulla of Vater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To examine a IgH/bcl-2 hybrid gene and VH gene to investigate the nature of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and how they differ from nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 40 patients reported previously, 35 with duodenal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were studied in detail with respect to clinicopathological characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 37/40 patients were in clinical stage I (n = 30) or stage II (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangement was detected in 53.3% of examined cases, and rearrangement of IgH/bcl-2 gene at the major break point was detected in 27% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of 8 examined cases were VH4 (38%); 2 out of them were VH4-34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As VH4 deviation is one of the common characteristics of MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 2/3 were identical, duodenal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> have a similar aetiology to MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical course was also similar to that of MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that duodenal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> have intermediate characteristics of MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
