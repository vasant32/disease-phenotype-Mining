<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in childhood is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors present four unusual primary follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the testis in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> tissue was evaluated using light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) and bcl-2 gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Southern blot and immunohistochemical analyses were used to detect bcl-6 gene rearrangements and protein expression, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four young boys ranging in age from 3 to 10 years were diagnosed with Stage IE follicular large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Grade 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> was documented in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four cases; monoclonality was confirmed in three cases by demonstration of light chain restriction or clonal IgH gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> expressed Bcl-2 or p53 protein, and bcl-2 gene rearrangements were not found in the three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Bcl-6 protein was expressed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> studied, and a bcl-6 gene rearrangement was detected in the one case analyzed by Southern blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four boys were treated by orchiectomy and combination chemotherapy and are alive with no evidence of disease 18-44 months following their initial diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> may rarely occur as primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039590" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">testicular tumors</z:e> in prepubertal boys and, when localized, appear to be associated with a favorable prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast to follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in adults, pediatric follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the testis are usually of large cell type (Grade 3) and lack bcl-2 or p53 abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The identification, in one case, of a bcl-6 gene rearrangement suggests an alternate molecular pathogenesis for pediatric follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
