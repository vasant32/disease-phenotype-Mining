<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: To date, little is known about blood immune marker changes that may be related to the development of Non Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and treatment response with few serum biomarkers that could be useful in follow- up of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To quantify the expression of suppressor of cytokine signalling-3-(SOCS-3) gene at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level in the peripheral blood of patients with NHL and correlate with clinical pathological features and response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients with NHL and 20 healthy controls were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The SOCS-3 mRNA level in peripheral blood (PB) was detected by semi-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantification of cytokines such as interleukin 6 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (IL-6 &amp; TNF-Î±) were performed using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increased expression of SOCS-3 mRNA in peripheral blood plus increased serum levels of IL-6 and TNF alpha from NHL cases with no complete remission after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher levels of expression of SOCS-3 are associated with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005956" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disease, bone marrow</z:e> involvement, extranodal involvement, poor performance status, B cell symptoms (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, night sweats and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>) and high serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase level which are evaluated by international prognostic index (IPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete responses occur in 60% of patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> expression of SOCS-3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased expression of SOCS-3 is common in diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, CLL/small lymphocytic B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Over-expression of SOCS-3 mRNA from peripheral blood of NHL patients correlates with advanced disease and poor response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SOCS-3 mRNA expression in peripheral blood from NHL patients might be used to monitor response during treatment </plain></SENT>
