<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A subgroup is probably of follicle centre cell origin and may evolve from a pre-existing follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18) chromosomal translocation can be demonstrated in the majority of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of t(14;18) translocation in a series of de novo nodal diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We correlated this with the immunohistochemical expression of CD10, bcl2 and bcl6, markers which are usually expressed by the neoplastic cells in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also correlated these parameters with the presence or absence of p53 protein expression by the neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Nodal diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (n=34) were stained immunohistochemically with monoclonal antibodies to CD10, bcl2, bcl6 and p53 (D07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the t(14;18) translocation was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen, 24 and 29 (41%, 71%, 85%) cases exhibited positivity for CD10, bcl2 and bcl6, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 12 cases there was positivity with D07 (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By PCR, the t(14;18) translocation was identified in five cases (15%), four of which were positive for CD10 and bcl2 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were positive for bcl6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One of five cases positive for the chromosomal translocation exhibited positivity with D07 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study the t(14;18) translocation was identified in 15% of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one of which exhibited positivity for CD10, bcl2 and bcl6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These may represent cases of follicle centre cell origin which may or may not have evolved from a pre-existing follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is possible that positivity for CD10 especially may identify cases which are of follicle centre cell origin and that the absence of t(14;18) translocation in some of these cases may reflect the fact that the translocation cannot normally be demonstrated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Whether the presence or absence of the translocation and the immunophenotype are prognostically important should be investigated further </plain></SENT>
