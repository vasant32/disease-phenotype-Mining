<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="42241">ethoxy</z:chebi> oligonucleotide (oligo), 20 bases long and specific for the translation initiation site of human Bcl-2 mRNA, was incorporated into liposomes to increase its intracellular delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This oligo selectively inhibited Bcl-2 protein expression and induced growth inhibition in t(14;18)-positive transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the inhibitory effects of shorter liposomal P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="42241">ethoxy</z:chebi> oligos (7, 9, 11 or 15 mer) in order to determine the activity of different oligo chain lengths targeted to the same Bcl-2 mRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 12 microM, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the oligos inhibited the growth of a FL cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared the 7-mer oligo with the 20-mer oligo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two oligos inhibited Bcl-2 protein expression similarly: 66% and 60% for the 7- and 20-mer, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The uptake and retention of both oligos were also very similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the Bcl-2 inhibitory activity is maintained with P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="42241">ethoxy</z:chebi> antisense oligos ranging from 7 to 20 bases </plain></SENT>
