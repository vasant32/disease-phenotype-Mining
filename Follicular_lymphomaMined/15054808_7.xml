<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify this we assessed the clinical and laboratory features of 51 patients presenting with cutaneous infiltration by B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data was available for 46 patients with a median age of 68 years (range 16-89 years) and a median follow-up of 32.5 months (range 5-123 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three of 51 (65%) patients had diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), and 15/51 (29%) had marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining 3 patients had follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, CLL, and post-transplant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 33 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, follow-up was available in 29; 24/29 (83%) had primary cutaneous disease, which was unifocal in 17/24 (71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following treatment, 8/24 (33%) of the primary cases relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 8 who relapsed, 7 had received local forms of treatment only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data was available in 14/15 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>11/14 (79%) had primary cutaneous disease, which was unifocal in 8 (73%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Following treatment, 4 of these cases relapsed (36%); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had received local therapy only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is evident from this study that a significant proportion ( reverse similar 20%) of patients who present with cutaneous infiltration by B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Staging is therefore mandatory in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Approximately 1/3 patients with primary cutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> ultimately relapse, and relapse rates appear higher in those patients receiving local therapy only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Systemic or combined modality therapy may therefore be the most appropriate treatment at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This should be assessed prospectively in randomized trials </plain></SENT>
