<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lowest proliferative indices were found in small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and intermediate lymphocytic/mantle zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An intermediate proliferative index was seen in the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and diffuse small cleaved cell and diffuse mixed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A high index was seen in the diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The highest and most consistent proliferative index was seen in small noncleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases of reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> had a significantly higher proliferative index than those of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the Ki-67 antibody has great utility in providing an estimate of the proliferative rate of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies may show this information to have prognostic value independent of histologic classification </plain></SENT>
