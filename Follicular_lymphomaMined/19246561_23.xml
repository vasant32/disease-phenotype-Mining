<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although rituximab is a key molecular targeting drug for CD20-positive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, resistance to rituximab has recently been recognized as a considerable problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that a CD20-negative phenotypic change after chemotherapies with rituximab occurs in a certain number of CD20-positive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For 5 years, 124 patients with B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> were treated with rituximab-containing chemotherapies in Nagoya University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relapse or progression was confirmed in 36 patients (29.0%), and a rebiopsy was performed in 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of those 19, 5 (26.3%; diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>], 3 cases; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> transformed from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 2 cases) indicated CD20 protein-negative transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite salvage chemotherapies without rituximab, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 patients died within 1 year of the CD20-negative transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitative reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that CD20 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was significantly lower in CD20-negative cells than in CD20-positive cells obtained from the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, when CD20-negative cells were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> in vitro, the expression of CD20 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was stimulated within 3 days, resulting in the restoration of both cell surface expression of the CD20 protein and rituximab sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that some epigenetic mechanisms may be partly related to the down-regulation of CD20 expression after rituximab treatment </plain></SENT>
