<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is characterized by a highly variable clinical course ranging from early transformation and disease-related mortality to prolonged periods of disease stability or even spontaneous remissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> is likely explained by differences in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> microenvironment, including variable infiltration by monocyte-derived cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined the absolute monocyte count obtained from a standard complete blood count with differential at the time of diagnosis as a prognostic factor in a cohort of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 355) treated at a single institution between 1998 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that the absolute monocyte count at diagnosis is associated with overall survival, independent of the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the absolute monocyte count improved the ability to identify high-risk patients when used in conjunction with the FLIPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results further support the central role of non-neoplastic myeloid-lineage cells in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> biology </plain></SENT>
