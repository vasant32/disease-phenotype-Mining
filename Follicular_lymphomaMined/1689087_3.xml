<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An immunohistochemical study of 63 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> was undertaken using formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The antibodies used were against L26, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>-1, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>-2, EMA (epithelial membrane antigen), Leu-M1, Vimentin, UCHL-1, S-100, and lysozyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> could be divided into three groups: the first group was <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>-1+/L26+/vimentin-, the second <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>-1-/L26+/vimentin+, and the third <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>-1-/L26-/vimentin+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were also examined and were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> positive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>-1 and L26 and negative for vimentin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus the vimentin negativity of the first group, including 7 nodular lymphocyte-predominant cases, gives further evidence of their germinal center B-cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since vimentin is expressed mainly in the immature stage of B-lymphocytes, the second group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> may represent immature B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the third group, vimentin was present in Reed-Sternberg's (RS) and Hodgkin's (H) cells in 45 of the 48 cases (92.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In none of 48 cases were these cells positive for S-100 or lysozyme, but strong vimentin-positivity still suggested monocytic or histiocytic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of our study suggest, at least, divergent origin of RS's and H's cells </plain></SENT>
