<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A new gene, LAZ3, has been shown to be involved in NHL with 3q27 rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two patients with B-cell NHL were studied by chromosome painting and Southern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes was shown to be an easy way to detect the chromosomal abnormality even in metaphase cells with poorly defined chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The gene LAZ3 was rearranged in one patient in the 'major translocation cluster region' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The comigration of rearranged LAZ3 and of IGL bands suggests that the translocation resulted in the juxtaposition of the two genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This juxtaposition makes possible a potential deregulation of the LAZ3 gene expression, as previously shown for the MYC and BCL2 genes in Burkitt and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> translocations </plain></SENT>
