<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is the first study from India that has incorporated immunophenotypic findings while investigating the distribution of NHL subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases diagnosed as NHL between January 1995 and June 1998 in the Department of Pathology and in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Registry, Tata Memorial Hospital, Bombay, were selected for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cases were reviewed by three pathologists and diagnostic problems were discussed by a panel of pathologists with a special interest in lymph node pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of a total of 2831 cases, the diagnosis of NHL was accepted in 2773 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> formed 79.1% of the NHLs, whereas T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> formed 16.2% of the total </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was the most common subtype (34% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follicular centre-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, B-cell small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (including MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) amounted to 12.6%, 5.7%, 3.4%, and 8.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, T-cell lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, anaplastic large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of T/null-cell type, and other nodal peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> accounted for 6%, 4.3%, and 2.9% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of NHL subtypes in India shows important differences with those from the rest of the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are less common in India compared to Europe and the USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and T/NK-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of nasal and nasal types, which are common in many other Asian countries, are also less prevalent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>T-cell lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and anaplastic large T/null cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are more prevalent in India </plain></SENT>
