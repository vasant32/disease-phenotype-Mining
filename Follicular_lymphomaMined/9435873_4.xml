<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In advance of using bispecific antibodies for the treatment of B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in humans, we analysed CD3 x CD19 bispecific antibodies for their capacity to induce T cell activation in cell suspensions from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate that the lack of costimulatory molecules, such as members of the B7 family, on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells resulted in insufficient activation of autologous T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, stimulation and proliferation of T cells could be induced by addition of monospecific CD28 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we show that bispecific CD3 x CD19 antibodies can protect <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) mice from human Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV)-induced B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these in vivo studies, CD28 costimulation did not show a significant benefit, possibly because of the high-level expression of CD80 and CD86 on the surface of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice with bispecific antibodies, with or without CD28 antibodies, induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-protective effects, as determined by a rechallenging experiment in long-term-surviving animals with the autologous EBV-transformed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> B cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment of a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patient by intratumoural injection of both antibodies resulted in immunological responses with increases in the T/B ratio of peripheral blood as well as enhanced NK cell activity without toxic systemic side-effects </plain></SENT>
