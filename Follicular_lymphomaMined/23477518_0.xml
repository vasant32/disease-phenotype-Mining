<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many patients enjoy a long period of asymptomatic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0008940'>generalized lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, with slow clinical progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For stage I FL and selected cases of stage II, the administration of definitive involved field radiation usually results in long-lasting remission and is still considered the treatment of choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For advanced disease (stages III-IV), the treating physician is called to select therapy from several options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because many patients are asymptomatic and have limited disease, clinical observation has been considered appropriate for selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For patients in need of treatment, the systemic treatment has historically been based on chemotherapy; however, rituximab monotherapy or radioimmunotherapy have recently been shown to be effective enough to merit consideration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there is considerable evidence to suggest that the first-line treatment should contain rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maintenance therapy with rituximab extends remission after chemotherapy in untreated patients and in patients who have relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Newer promising treatments include anti-CD20 antibodies (or other surface antigens) engineered for greater efficacy, biological agents or vaccination therapy </plain></SENT>
