<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>First-line standard therapy in advanced, symptomatic iNHL consists of rituximab-based immunochemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The recent rediscovery of the 'old' chemotherapeutic agent bendamustine, an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agent</z:chebi> with a peculiar mechanism of action, has added a new effective and well-tolerated option to the therapeutic armamentarium in iNHL, increasing response rates and duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, patients invariably relapse and subsequent active and well-tolerated agents are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In recent years a large number of new targeted agents have been tested in preclinical and clinical experimentation in FL and indolent nonfollicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (iNFL), including the new monoclonal antibodies binding CD20 or other surface antigens, immunoconjugates and bispecific antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover novel agents directed against intracellular processes such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitors</z:chebi>, mTOR inhibitors and agents that target the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> microenvironment, notably the immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide, are under active clinical investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The development of these new drugs may change in the near future the approach to iNHL patients, leading to better tolerated and effective therapy regimens </plain></SENT>
