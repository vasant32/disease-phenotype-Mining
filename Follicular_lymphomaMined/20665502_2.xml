<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 13,203 NHL patients were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database who were diagnosed from 1992 through 2002 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 40% (n = 5266) of patients received CSF </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a multivariable Cox regression analysis adjusted for gender, histology, stage, comorbidities, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy agent, CSF use was found to be independently associated with a 53% increased risk of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (hazard ratio [HR], 1.53; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.26-1.84) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients who received both CSF and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35221">antimetabolite</z:chebi> chemotherapy were found to have a 2.5-fold increased risk of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (HR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.91-3.26) compared with patients who received neither agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current study, which to our knowledge is the first large population-based study published to date, demonstrated that the administration of CSF among elderly NHL patients receiving chemotherapy was associated with an increased risk of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, although the absolute risk was low </plain></SENT>
