<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There are different frequencies in the immunological phenotypes of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in Tohoku and Kyushu districts of Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the Tohoku district, the northern area of Honshu, B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are more preponderant than T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is just the reverse on the islands of Kyushu and Shikoku </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histologically diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of large cell type, formerly termed reticulum cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> or histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, was the most frequent (48%) among B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is characteristic of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that immunoglobulin is produced in either or both the cellular surface and cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic IgM in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells was mainly detected by an electron microscopic enzyme-labeled method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic-Ig was present both in the nuclear membrane and endoplasmic reticulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This technique is particularly useful in medium-sized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells because of the scanty cytoplasmic rim making light microscopic evaluation difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histological transition from follicular to diffuse pattern is characterized by a change of cellular arrangement from labyrinth-like cellular connections in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to more simple connections in diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The transition is also supported by the fact that a higher <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16991">deoxyribonucleic acid</z:chebi> content is observed in large cells than medium-sized cells in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The data also supports the hypothesis that a diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> evolved from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> mainly occurs in cases of large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
