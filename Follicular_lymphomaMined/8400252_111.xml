<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The majority of low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> will eventually transform to an aggressive intermediate, or high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanisms responsible for this transformation have not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied serial biopsies from 34 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that underwent histologic transformation, for abnormalities of the p53 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene by a combination of immunohistochemistry, single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP), and sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found overexpression of p53 in 10 of the 34 transformed aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 9 of which contained mutations identified by SSCP analysis and subsequent sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Matched pretransformation low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> biopsies were available for 7 of the 10 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of six studied by immunohistochemistry showed overexpression of p53 and only 1 of 4 studied by SSCP/sequencing showed the presence of mutation in the pretransformation biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, an eighth p53 positive transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> recurred with a clonally related, p53 negative low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 5 years after the patient had achieved a complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry also showed that several pretransformation biopsies from p53 positive transformed cases showed rare p53 positive cells and in one case we could document an increase in their number over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five additional low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> biopsies were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> positive for p53 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One of the three subsequently transformed within a year of the biopsy studied; the second patient had an earlier (unavailable) biopsy at a different site that showed transformed histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The third patient was treated with ProMACE-MOPP combination chemotherapy and attained a complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that (1) mutations of p53 are associated with histologic transformation in approximately 25% to 30% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and (2) p53 positive cells can be detected before histologic transformation, but do not comprise a significant percentage of the neoplastic cell population (identifiable by SSCP) until late in the disease, just before or after histologic progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Finally, the data also suggest that p53 positive low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are at risk for progression and that in this subset, aggressive therapy may be warranted </plain></SENT>
