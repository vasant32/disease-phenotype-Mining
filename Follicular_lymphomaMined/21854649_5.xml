<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to analyze subtype distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in southwest China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> diagnosed within 9 years in a single institution in Southwest China were analyzed according to the WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From January 2000 to December 2008, a total number of 6,382 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were established, of which mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> accounted for 56%, mature T- and NK-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> occupied 26%, and precursor lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were 5% and 13%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mixed cellularity (76%) was the major subtype of classical Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; and the bimodal age distribution was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The top six subtypes of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were as follows: diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, extranodal NK/T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, nasal type, extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, precursor lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> comprised about half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, and most frequently involved Waldeyer's ring, gastrointestinal tract, sinonasal region and skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> of Southwest China displayed some epidemiologic features similar to those reported in literature from western and Asian countries, as well as other regions of China, whereas some subtypes showed distinct features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The high frequency of mature T/NK cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, especially for extranodal NK/T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, nasal type, is the most outstanding characteristic of this series </plain></SENT>
