<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this prospective, single-arm, open-labelled, multicentre non-randomised phase II trial (FLUMIZ [FLUdarabine, MItoxantrone, Zevalin] trial) we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of fludarabine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> plus radioimmunotherapy in untreated patients with follicular non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with stage III or IV untreated indolent follicular NHL were enrolled between June 1, 2004, and April 15, 2006, at 13 Italian institutions, and were treated with oral fludarabine (40 mg/m2 on days 1 to 3) and intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> (10 mg/m2 on day 1) every 28 days for six cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who had at least a partial response (PR) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet counts (&gt;100x10(9)/L) and granulocyte counts (1.5x10(9)/L), and bone-marrow infiltration less than 25% 4-6 weeks after completion of the sixth cycle of chemotherapy were deemed eligible for consolidation treatment 6-10 weeks after the sixth cycle with one course of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">yttrium</z:chebi>-90 ((90)Y)-labelled ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin), which consisted of an initial infusion of intravenous rituximab (250 mg/m2) on day 1 followed by a second 250 mg/m2 infusion on day 7, 8, or 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second infusion was followed by a weight-based dose of 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan, administered as a slow intravenous push over 10 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoints were complete response (CR) and haematological toxic effects and secondary endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Responses were classified according to the International Workshop for Response Criteria for non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis was per protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This trial is registered as a European Standard Controlled Trial on the EudraCT website http://oss-sper-clin.agenziafarmaco.it, number 2004-002211-92 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: 61 patients were enrolled in the trial and received six cycles of fludarabine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi>, after which an overall response was noted in 98% (60 of 61) of patients (43 of 61 patients had CR and 17 of 61 patients had PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>57 patients (43 with CR and 14 with PR) were deemed eligible for subsequent (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 14 patients who had PR after the initial treatment, 12 obtained CR after (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>By the end of the entire treatment regimen 55 of 57 patients achieved CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 30 months (range 21-48), 3-year progression-free survival was estimated to be 76% (95% CI 72.3-82.4) and 3-year overall survival 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>36 of 57 patients had grade 3 or 4 haematological toxic effects, and blood transfusions were given to 21 of 57 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: This trial has provided evidence for the feasibility, tolerability, and efficacy of fludarabine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> plus (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan in untreated patients with follicular NHL </plain></SENT>
