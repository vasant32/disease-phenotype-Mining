<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal was to have a treatment program feasible in 75% or more of the treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The secondary objectives were to determine the toxicities, the complete and partial response rates, and the time to treatment failure (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The trial also attempted to assess the effectiveness of this treatment program in eradicating Bcl-2 rearrangements by PCR, and to assess complete remission duration in relationship to PCR results in patients who respond to this chemotherapy program </plain></SENT>
