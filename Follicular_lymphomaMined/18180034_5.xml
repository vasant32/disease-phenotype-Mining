<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test the association of SHM with transformation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), we sequenced mutational hot spots in five proto-oncogenes (BCL6, PAX5, RHOH, MYC and PIM1) in 32 low-grade FL (lgFL) with follicular histology and 26 transformed FL (tFL) with diffuse large cell histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No difference was detected in the fraction of specimens mutated (75% of lgFL and 77% of tFL) or in the mutation load (0.08 for lgFL vs. 0.06 mutations/100 bp/allele for tFL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial specimens were examined from 25 patients showing stable low-grade FL (slgFL; n=6) or a low-grade FL that later transformed into diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (tFL; n=19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>slgFL and tFL patients accumulated similar numbers of mutations in the interval between biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that mutations attributable to aberrant SHM occur with similar frequency in low-grade and transformed FL; transformation is not associated with a higher rate of aberrant SHM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the frequency of mutations attributable to aberrant SHM in tFL was significantly lower than that reported for de novo diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, suggesting differing oncogenic mechanisms in transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and de novo diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
