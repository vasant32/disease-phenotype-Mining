<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of circulating t(14;18)-positive cells in patients with long-term remission after radiation therapy for stage I and II follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Peripheral-blood mononuclear cells from 21 patients in continuous remission were examined by a two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the detection of cells carrying a t(14;18) translocation with a breakpoint within the major breakpoint region (MBR) or minor cluster region (mcr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Follow-up duration was between 25 and 160 months, with a median of 6.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (62%) showed negative results on repetitive testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells that were t(14;18)-positive were found in eight patients (38%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> carrying a breakpoint in the MBR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient relapsed in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Circulating t(14;18)-positive cells can persist in a high percentage of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients in long-term complete remission (CR) after radiation treatment for stage I and II disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The significance of minimal residual t(14;18)-positive cells with regard to the risk of relapse needs to be investigated in further prospective long-term studies </plain></SENT>
