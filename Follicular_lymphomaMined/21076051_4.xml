<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To explore the role of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> in NHL risk and the potential interaction with UVR, the authors genotyped 10 VDR polymorphisms in 2,448 NHL patients and 1,981 controls from Denmark and Sweden who were recruited in 1999-2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were computed with logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>P values were 2-sided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most VDR variants (e.g., rs731236/TaqI, rs15444410/BsmI) were not associated with overall risk of NHL, but there was some evidence of a positive association between rs4760655 and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> risk (nominal P(trend) = 0.004, corrected P(trend) = 0.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no support for an effect of interaction between VDR variants and UVR exposure on risk of overall NHL or B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there was some evidence that rs731236 altered associations between UVR and T-cell NHL risk; while increasing UVR frequency lowered T-cell NHL risk among rs731236 TT carriers, an elevated risk was observed among rs731236 CC carriers (nominal P(interaction) ≤ 0.008, corrected P(interaction) ≥ 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VDR does not appear to harbor major determinants of NHL risk, except perhaps for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in effects of UVR exposure on T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> risk by VDR rs731236 genotype merits further investigation </plain></SENT>
