<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The BCL6 gene encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor and is altered by chromosomal arrangements in its 5' noncoding region in approximately 30% of diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here that, in 22/30 (73%) DLCL and 7/15 (47%) follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), but not in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types, the BCL6 gene is also altered by multiple (1.4 x 10(-3) -1.6 x 10(-2) per bp), often biallelic, mutations clustering in its 5' noncoding region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These mutations are of somatic origin and are found in cases displaying either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or rearranged BLC6 alleles indicating their independence from chromosomal rearrangements and linkage to immunoglobulin genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These alterations identify a mechanism of genetic instability in malignant B cells and may have been selected during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> for their role in altering BCL6 expression </plain></SENT>
