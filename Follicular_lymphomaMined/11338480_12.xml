<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and gene rearrangement studies are usually sufficient to differentiate among these entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present 11 cases of floral FCL that were evaluated at our institution by flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, or both and by polymerase chain reaction-based molecular analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 4 cases, the neoplastic B cells coexpressed CD5 antigens; 3 of these 4 cases also were CD10+, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> demonstrated rearrangement within the bcl-2 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that a subset of floral FCL is CD5+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recognition of this immunophenotype is important to avoid misdiagnosis of nodular variants of small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Studies suggest that expression of CD5 by neoplastic germinal center cells might result from alterations of the follicular microenvironment and/or inappropriate B-cell responses to cytokine networks </plain></SENT>
