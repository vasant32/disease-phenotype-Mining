<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> occurred in men with a median age of 69 years (range, 37 to 87 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine of the 14 patients with follow-up died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (median survival, 12 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that were positive for CD20 and commonly showed plasmacytoid differentiation (10 of 20 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three cases were Burkitt's-like large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infiltration by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the seminiferous tubules was seen in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were negative for human herpesvirus 8 and Epstein-Barr virus by 35 cycles of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), suggesting that these viruses are not involved in the pathogenesis of primary testicular diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PCR-based studies for t(14;18) and t(11;14) translocations, commonly seen in follicular and mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, were negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nucleotide sequences of the V-D- and J segments of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH) rearrangements obtained in 12 cases after PCR amplification were analyzed and compared with known germlines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of VH-family use in testicular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> was similar to that reported for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood lymphocytes and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This contrasts with the previously published findings of preferential use of the VH3- or VH4-family by nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Comparison with the published germlines showed a low similarity index in most of the cases, suggesting the presence of extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ongoing mutation, as indicated by intraclonal variation in IgH sequence, was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sequenced cases, suggesting direct antigen stimulation, which represents another difference between primary testicular and nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that testicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> represent a subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> that differs from their nodal counterparts in several respects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Their histological and molecular features show some similarities to those seen in marginal zone (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
