<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was a Japanese man who had a history of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and received MACOP-B combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen months after the completion of the treatment, the patient developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (M2), which was regarded as a therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic study of bone marrow cells showed t(1;11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although he achieved complete remission by combination chemotherapy, a relapse of NHL and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> were revealed in the course of the consolidation chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The NHL was considered a histological conversion from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> because <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells carried t(14;18) (q32;q21) and were strongly positive for BCL2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Translocation (1;11), together with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> having t(7;11) or inv(11) involving 11p15, shows that 11p15 is a common acceptor site of these chromosome aberrations and suggests the significance of the NUP98 gene located in 11p15 in therapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
