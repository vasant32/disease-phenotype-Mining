<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, there are data suggesting that alpha interferon demonstrates synergistic antitumor activity with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> in animal models for a number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on these data, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> Group B (CALGB) undertook a phase II pilot study of the combination of interferon rIFN alpha 2b (2 x 10(6) IU/m2 s.c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>tiw) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (100 mg/m2 per day orally) with the ultimate purpose of examining this combination as long-term therapy of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in comparison to oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred five advanced stage III or IV eligible patients with pathologically diagnosed International Working Formulation B or C histology were entered on CALGB 8553 to determine toxicity and response rates to the combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both previously chemotherapy-treated patients (32) and patients without prior chemotherapy (73) were entered on study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For patients without prior chemotherapy the overall response rate to the combination regimen was 86% with 58% of chemotherapy-treated patients achieving complete response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy-treated patients had a total response rate of 62% with only 25% complete responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete responses in patients without prior chemotherapy were positively correlated with absence of B symptoms, and good performance status and negatively correlated with the histological subtype of follicular mixed small-cleaved and large cell histology (IWF C); only performance status was significantly correlated with response in patients who had previously had chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survival at 5 years is estimated to be 63% for those without chemotherapy and 39% for those previously treated with chemotherapy patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The maximum toxicities experienced during therapy with the combination regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and interferon alpha were primarily related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sixty-seven percent of patients without prior chemotherapy and 65% of patients receiving prior chemotherapy experienced severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> while severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> occurred in 6-31% of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Non-myelosuppressive toxicities were less frequently seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These response rates are similar to those achieved in a previous CALGB trial with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> as a single agent, although severe myelotoxicity was increased to approximately 60% of patients from less than 10% with the single-agent therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The combination of alpha interferon and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> administered in this fashion is safe when peripheral counts are carefully monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Randomized studies of this regimen in comparison to oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> are currently in progress </plain></SENT>
