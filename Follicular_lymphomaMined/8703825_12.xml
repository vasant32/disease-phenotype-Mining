<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a series of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> with regard to rearrangement of the BCL6 gene on chromosome band 3q27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis using probes from the major translocation cluster (MTC) region of the BCL6 revealed rearrangement in 21/197 patients (10.7%) with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> studied at presentation, and 11/25 patients (44%) first studied at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) studied at diagnosis, rearrangements of the BCL6 gene were not closely associated with a specific histopathologic subtype but distributed in subcategories in the Working Formulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was 12.1%, with significantly higher frequency in mixed and large cell subtypes, and that in diffuse aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was 14.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comigration analysis using probes from the immunoglobulin genes revealed association of the BCL6 gene with one of the three immunoglobulin loci in 9/25 cases analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A comparative study between NHL associated either with BCL2 or BCL6 rearrangement showed that advanced disease and bone marrow involvement were more frequent in BCL2(+) NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, extranodal involvement was more frequently observed in the BCL6(+) NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The survival curve of BCL6(+) NHL was characterized by a rapid decline followed by a plateau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the total of 32 BCL6(+) patients, six carried both BCL2 and BCL6 rearrangements; five of these six showed clinicopathological properties characteristic of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, suggesting that the presence of the two genetic abnormalities does not necessarily have synergistic effects on malignant phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The high level of BCL6 expression in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines carrying a BCL2 rearrangement suggests that the deregulated BCL2 gene may have an effect on the development of genetic abnormalities of the BCL6 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that BCL6 gene rearrangement is primarily involved in large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> irrespective of growth pattern of neoplastic cells, and that BCL6(+)BCL2(-) NHL could be curable with modern intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
