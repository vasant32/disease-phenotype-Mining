<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Studies of smoking and risk of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) have yielded inconsistent results, possibly due to subtype <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> and/or genetic variation impacting the metabolism of tobacco-derived carcinogens, including substrates of the N-acetyltransferase enzymes NAT1 and NAT2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a pooled analysis of 5,026 NHL cases and 4,630 controls from seven case-control studies in the international <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> epidemiology consortium to examine associations between smoking, variation in the N-acetyltransferase genes NAT1 and NAT2, and risk of NHL subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Smoking data were harmonized across studies, and genetic variants in NAT1 and NAT2 were used to infer acetylation phenotype of the NAT1 and NAT2 enzymes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) for risk of NHL and subtypes were calculated using joint fixed effects unconditional logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Current smoking was associated with a significant 30 % increased risk of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 1,176) but not NHL overall or other NHL subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association was similar among NAT2 slow (OR 1.36; 95 % CI 1.07-1.75) and intermediate/rapid (OR 1.27; 95 % CI 0.95-1.69) acetylators (p (interaction) = 0.82) and also did not differ by NAT1*10 allelotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither NAT2 phenotype nor NAT1*10 allelotype was associated with risk of NHL overall or NHL subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The current findings provide further evidence for a modest association between current smoking and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> risk and suggest that this association may not be influenced by variation in the N-acetyltransferase enzymes </plain></SENT>
