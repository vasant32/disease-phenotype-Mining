<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This report deals with an unusual case of a patient with follicular small cleaved lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who developed Merkel-cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> soon after receiving chemoimmunotherapy with a fludarabine-containing regimen and rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presentation of the Merkel-cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in this patient was atypical because of the absence of dermal involvement and the very rapid clinical progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the light of recent reports which suggest a possible link between the immunocompromised state and the development of Merkel-cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, the atypical presentation seen in this patient may indeed imply a possible link between the therapy given and the development of Merkel-cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documentation of Merkel-cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> appearing in a patient soon after treatment with fludarabine and/or rituximab </plain></SENT>
