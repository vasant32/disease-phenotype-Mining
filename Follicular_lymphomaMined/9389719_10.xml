<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This approach may potentially reduce the quality and quantity of hematopoietic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The capacity of stem cells recovered after dose intensification to support myeloablative therapy is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with previously untreated advanced follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, trilineage hematopoietic engraftment was compared in two sequential trials of induction therapy (standard dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> [CHOP] without growth factors or dose intensification CHOP supported by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF ]) followed by identical myeloablative therapy and autologous stem cell support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil, platelet, and red blood cell (RBC) engraftment were compared on days 100, 180, and 360 after stem cell reinfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite similar patient characteristics including reinfusion of comparable numbers of marrow mononuclear cells, after stem cell transplantation, a highly significant prolongation of neutrophil and platelet engraftment was seen in patients who received high dose CHOP and G-CSF in comparison to standard dose CHOP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that dose intensified chemotherapy and G-CSF recruited stem cells into a proliferative phase and that G-CSF allowed retreatment at a time when stem cells were susceptible to damage by cytotoxic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Such inadequate hematologic engraftment after myeloablative therapy might be avoided by either shortening the time that growth factor support is administered, lengthening the interval between cycles, or attempting to repetitively harvest additional stem cells either from the marrow or peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, intensification of chemotherapy with growth factor support must be used with caution if stem cells are to be used to support myeloablative therapy </plain></SENT>
