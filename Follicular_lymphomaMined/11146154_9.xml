<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an increasingly successful modality for treating a variety of malignant disorders in the clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experimental and clinical data suggest that prior exposure to cytotoxic agents that damage primitive stem cells results in <z:mp ids='MP_0001606'>impaired hematopoiesis</z:mp> after autologous HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the ability to predict for <z:mp ids='MP_0001606'>impaired hematopoiesis</z:mp>, we measured different stem/progenitor cell populations transplanted and time to engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with previously untreated, advanced-stage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were treated in sequential prospective protocols with 6-8 cycles of standard-dose (SD) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHOP), or four cycles of a higher-dose (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) CHOP and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, to induce remission prior to high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, total body irradiation, and autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cryopreserved marrow samples obtained prior to ABMT were assayed for CD34(+), CD34(+)38(-), and cobblestone area-forming cell (CAFC) frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite receiving similar numbers of nucleated cells at ABMT, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-CHOP patients took significantly longer to attain platelet engraftment than the SD-CHOP patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Marrow from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>-CHOP patients contained significantly lower CD34(+), CD34(+)38(-), and week 6-8 CAFC frequencies than marrow from SD-CHOP-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Time to platelet engraftment was plotted against progenitor/stem cell numbers transplanted for each patient and threshold values were developed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three stem/progenitor cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These values were 0.5 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg, 0.14 x 10(6) CD34(+)38(-) cells/kg, and 9500 week-6 CAFC/kg transplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Approximately 50% of patients received marrow progenitor/stem cell numbers above the threshold values and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> engrafted without delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, transplantation of stem/progenitor cell numbers below threshold values did not uniformly predict for delayed platelet engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data provide further evidence for the association of low marrow reserve at ABMT, low numbers of stem/progenitor cells transplanted, and delayed hematopoietic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, there remains a group of patients who have rapid platelet engraftment after ABMT despite low numbers of progenitor/stem cells transplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data suggest the presence of a crucial stem cell population not represented by the stem/progenitor cell populations studied in these experiments </plain></SENT>
