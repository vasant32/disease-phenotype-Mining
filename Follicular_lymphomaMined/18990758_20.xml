<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TNF signaling activates the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) canonical pathway, leading to transcriptional activation of multiple genes that influence <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that, in addition to TNF signaling, common genetic variation in genes from the NF-kappaB canonical pathway may affect risk of NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We genotyped 54 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) within TNF, lymphotoxin A LTA, and nine NF-kappaB genes from the canonical pathway (TNFRSF1A, TRADD, TRAF2, TRAF5, RIPK1, CHUK, IKBKB, NFKB1, and REL) in a clinic-based study of 441 incident cases and 475 frequency-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tagging SNPs were selected from HapMap supplemented by putative functional SNPs for LTA/TNF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used principal components and haplo.stats to model gene-level associations and logistic regression to model SNP-level associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (GG), the AA genotype for the TNF promoter polymorphism G-308A (rs1800629) was associated with increased risk of NHL [odds ratio (OR), 2.14; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.94-4.85], whereas the GA genotype was not (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.74-1.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This association was similar for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A previously reported LTA/TNF haplotype was also associated with NHL risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In gene-level analysis of the NF-kappaB pathway, only NFKB1 showed a statistically significant association with NHL (P = 0.049), and one NFKB1 tagSNP (rs4648022) was associated with NHL risk overall (ordinal OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.41-0.84; Ptrend = 0.0037) and for each of the common subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we provide additional evidence for the role of genetic variation in TNF and LTA SNPs and haplotypes with risk of NHL and also provide some of the first preliminary evidence for an association of genetic variation in NFKB1, a downstream target of TNF signaling, with risk of NHL </plain></SENT>
