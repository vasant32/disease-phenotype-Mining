<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 53-year-old man who had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> related to constitutional hMLH1 mutation and who was diagnosed as having a duodenal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> This diagnosis was supported by IgH-BCL2 rearrangement and BCL2 immunoreactivity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
