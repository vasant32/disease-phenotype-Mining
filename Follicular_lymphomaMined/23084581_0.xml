<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Relatively few cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with t(14;18) have been reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the clinicopathologic, cytogenetic, and molecular genetic features of 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> associated with t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 9 men and 3 women, with a median age of 51 years at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To date, 11 patients have required chemotherapy, 6 before coming to our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up, 5 patients have died of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Karyotypic analysis showed that 10 cases had t(14;18) in the stemline and 2 cases in the sideline; t(14;18) was the sole abnormality in the stemline in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 11 cases, other abnormalities were identified in the stemline or sidelines, most commonly <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 12 in 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 12 was associated with atypical <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunophenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 8 cases tested, 7 showed somatically mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the t(14;18) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> is associated with relatively young age at diagnosis, mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes, and a clinical course that usually requires chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cytogenetic findings, in particular, t(14;18) in the stemline in 10 cases and as the sole karyotypic abnormality in 2 cases, suggest that t(14;18) is an early pathogenetic event in this small subset of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
