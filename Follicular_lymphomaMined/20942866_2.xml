<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Untreated patients in the concurrent arm (Arm C) received six R (375 mg/m(2) ) treatments, 2 days prior to each cycle of CHOP, and patients in the sequential arm (Arm S) received 6 weekly R (375 mg/m(2) ) treatments following six cycles of CHOP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine patients were randomized but two patients were withdrawn before receiving the protocol treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five patients (94%) had follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 37 (55%) were at low risk, 23 (34%) at intermediate risk and seven (10%) at high risk according to the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that the overall response rate (ORR) in Arm C and in Arm S was 94% and 97%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median progression-free survival (PFS)/7-year PFS rate in Arm C, Arm S and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 67 assessable patients was 2.4 years/23% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9-40%), 3.8 years/41% (95% CI, 23-57%) and 2.8 years/32% (95% CI, 20-45%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the two arms (P = 0.107) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall survival (OS) of the 67 patients was 95% at 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, R-CHOP is a highly effective initial treatment for untreated indolent B-NHL in terms of ORR and OS; however, its long-term PFS is not good enough either in concurrent or sequential combination, warranting further investigations on post-remission therapy </plain></SENT>
