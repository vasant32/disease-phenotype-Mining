<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Therapeutic options for relapsed or refractory follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> include combination chemotherapy, immunotherapy and, for selected patients, autotransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the different mechanisms of action and non-overlapping toxicities, combination of rituximab with chemotherapy is a rational approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 30 patients with follicular non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with advanced-stage disease were treated with four cycles of immunochemotherapy with rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day 1, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> 2 mg i.v. on day 2 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 400 mg/m2 i.v. from days 2 to 6, repeated at 3-week intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had received multiple lines of therapy (median 3); 9 (30%) had relapses (2 after high-dose therapy with autologous transplant), and 21 (70%) were in relapse and refractory to salvage treatment (with an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-containing regimen in 19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 29 patients evaluable for response, 16 (55 %) obtained a complete response (CR) and 3 (10%) a partial response (PR), with an overall response rate of 65% (19/29); 10 patients (35%) achieved less than PR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median event-free survival was 16.1 months for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, being 22.8 months for responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 2 years from the start of therapy (range 6 months to 3.8 years), of 16 patients who achieved CR, 10 remain free of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The combination of rituximab with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> and 5-day <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> is able to produce CR in patients with advanced follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, even in patients resistant to third-generation regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The regimen designed on the basis of pharmacokinetics of the chimeric antibody seemed important for the clinical efficacy of the combination </plain></SENT>
