<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This recently standardized diagnostic procedure is very quick and can be performed in a few hours </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 6 other cases the information about the staging of B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> was superior in the frozen biopsies to the paraffin embedded preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Amongst many other features the monoclonality of B CLL/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the special features of B CLL infiltrates (RFA-1+, Leu-1+, HLA-DR+, SmIg+), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> deposits (containing follicular dendritic cells) and non-T, non-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic leukaemic blasts (terminal transferase+, HLA-DR+) as well as the sometimes conspicuous presence of infiltrating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T cells could be clearly and reproducibly demonstrated </plain></SENT>
