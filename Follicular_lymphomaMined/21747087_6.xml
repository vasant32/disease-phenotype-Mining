<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The utility of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) in assessing response at the end of induction therapy is well documented in Hodgkin's and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, but its role in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) remains undetermined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the prognostic significance of PET-CT performed after first-line therapy in patients with FL treated in the prospective Primary Rituximab and Maintenance (PRIMA) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Results of PET-CT scans performed after induction immunochemotherapy were recorded retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients went on to either observation or rituximab maintenance per protocol independent of the PET-CT result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics and outcomes were then evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 122 PET-CT scans performed at the end of the induction immunochemotherapy, 32 (26%) were reported as positive by the local investigator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Initial demographic or disease characteristics did not differ between PET-CT-positive (PET-positive) and PET-CT-negative (PET-negative) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PET status correlated with conventional response criteria (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients remaining PET positive had a significantly (P &lt; .001) inferior progression-free survival at 42 months of 32.9% (95% CI, 17.2% to 49.5%) compared with 70.7% (95% CI, 59.3% to 79.4%) in those who became PET negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PET status, but not conventional response (complete response or complete response unconfirmed v partial response) according to IWC 1999, was an independent predictive factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was also increased in PET-positive patients (hazard ratio 7.0; P = .0011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: [(18)F]FDG PET-CT status at the end of immunochemotherapy induction in patients with FL is strongly predictive of outcome and should be considered a meaningful clinical end point in future studies </plain></SENT>
