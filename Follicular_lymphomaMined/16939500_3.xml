<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Presentation lymph nodes from 82 FL patients for whom clinical information was available were immunohistochemically segregated into SOCS3-positive (n = 42) or -negative (n = 40) cohorts, and overall survival (OS) was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SOCS3-positive FL patients had a median OS of 10 years compared with 22 years in SOCS3-negative patients (P = 0.001, log rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index subgroups, SOCS3 overexpression remained an independent predictor of decreased OS (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that overexpression of SOCS3 may be an independent poor prognostic variable in patients with de novo FL </plain></SENT>
