<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Chemokines are a family of 8-10 kDa proteins with a wide range of biological activities including the regulation of leukocyte trafficking, modulation of haemopoietic cell proliferation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to extracellular matrix molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a panel of chemokine receptor-specific monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) in a multicolour flow cytometry approach we analysed the expression of the lymphocyte-associated chemokine receptors CXCR4, CXCR5, CCR5 and CCR6 in B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>; six cases), B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (B-CLL; 31 cases), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (10 cases), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, four cases), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL, three cases) and hairy cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (HCL, five cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that CXCR4, CXCR5 and CCR6 are differentially expressed in these B <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> depending on the maturational stage of the malignant B cell population investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, we found that CXCR4 is strongly expressed on immature ALL blasts whereas no surface immunoreactivity for CXCR5, CCR5 and CCR6 was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By contrast, non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHLs) corresponding to more mature peripheral B cell subsets (ie B-CLL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) exhibited high expression levels of CXCR4 and CXCR5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of terminally differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cells revealed a down-regulation of CXCR4, CXCR5 and CCR6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CCR5, which is not expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells, was also absent from the majority of NHLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, CCR5 staining was seen in three of five cases of HCL, representing the first example of cross-lineage aberrant chemokine receptor expression in malignant haemopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
