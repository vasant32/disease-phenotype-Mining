<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2 protooncogene was initially discovered at the t(14;18) chromosomal breakpoint in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that bcl-2 protein (Bcl-2) expression blocks <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and plays an important role in cell development and maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, Bcl-2 expression was immunohistochemically examined in 103 cases of gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, as well as 64 cases of non-carcinous gastric mucosa, and its correlation with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, cell proliferation and p53 immunoreactivity was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 was detected in 18.0% of differentiated-type gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (9 of 50) and 7.5% of the undifferentiated type (4 of 53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In adjacent intestinal metaplastic gastric epithelium, the incidence of Bcl-2 positivity in the incomplete type (21/23, 91.3%) was significantly higher than in the complete type (23/41, 56.1%) (P &lt; 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Double immunostaining for Bcl-2 and Ki-67 clearly revealed the majority of Bcl-2-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells to be in a nonproliferating state, although some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells expressed both proteins together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical assessment demonstrated that the average Ki-67 labeling index and apoptotic labeling index in Bcl-2-positive foci were significantly lower than in Bcl-2-negative foci (P &lt; 0.0001, P &lt; 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, a significant dissociation between Bcl-2 and p53 immunoreactivity was found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that aberrant Bcl-2 expression in gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> possibly originates from intestinal metaplastic epithelium, and suggest a possible role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development and growth </plain></SENT>
