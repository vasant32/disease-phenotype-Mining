<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was a 74-year-old Chinese woman with sequential <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> in the right and left cervical regions over a period of 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first biopsy revealed in situ follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with progressive transformation of germinal centers, and the biopsy of the second lymph node led to a diagnosis of in situ follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotype, polymerase chain reaction amplification of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene, and fluorescence in situ hybridization for t(14;18) were analyzed in each biopsy specimen, which showed both specimens to have t(14;18)(q32;q21) and revealed progression from polyclonality to monoclonality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a case of multicentric in situ follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and provide new insights into the pathogenesis of this disease </plain></SENT>
