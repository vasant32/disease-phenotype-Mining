<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes (IgH) result in a deregulation of the gene and increased transcription of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for the bcl-2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In cases of rearrangement of the light chains (variant translocations), a third breakpoint has been described at the 5' part of the bcl-2 locus (vcr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present case, we report the molecular analysis of an FL transformed into a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blastic phase</z:e> unresponsive to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular studies revealed a typical bcl-2 rearrangement at the major locus (mbr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vcr rearrangements was also observed with only a single restriction enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the same time, SSCP analysis of exon 5 of the p53 locus disclosed an abnormal conformer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing revealed a point mutation at codon 163 (A --&gt; G) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of the affected sites disclosed overexpression of p53 and bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that p53 mutation can contribute to blastic transformation in cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with double rearrangement at the bcl-2 locus (mbr/vcr) </plain></SENT>
