<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The method is based on training and testing of a quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) classifier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The novel aspects of this method are the identification of the CB object with prior information, and the introduction of the principal component analysis (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) in the spectral domain to extract color texture features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both geometric and texture features are used to achieve the classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experimental results on real follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> images demonstrate that the combined feature space improved the performance of the system significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The implemented method can identify centroblast cells (CB) from non-centroblast cells (non-CB) with a classification accuracy of 82.56% </plain></SENT>
