<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently demonstrated that highly <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>- and HLA-specific T cells can readily be generated against allogeneic HLA-A*02:01 in complex with a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> from the B cell-restricted protein CD20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that such CD20-specific T cells can easily be induced from na√Øve precursors in cord blood, demonstrating that they do not represent cross-reactive memory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cells displayed high avidity and mediated potent cytotoxic effects on cells from patients with the CD20(pos) B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the cytotoxicity was consistently lower for cells from two of the ALL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ALL cells that were less efficiently killed did not display lower surface expression of CD20 or HLA-A*02:01, or mutations in the CD20 sequence </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adoptive transfer of CD20-specific T cells to an HLA-A*02:01(pos) patient requires an HLA-A*02:01(neg) , but otherwise HLA identical, donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A search clarified that donors meeting these criteria can be readily identified even for patients with rare haplotypes </plain></SENT>
