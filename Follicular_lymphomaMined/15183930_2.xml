<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Idiotypic IgMs (Id-IgM) were isolated from two patients and used to immunise a strain of mice, deficient in mouse antibody production and engineered with yeast artificial chromosomes (YAC) containing fragments of the human immunoglobulin (Ig) micro/delta heavy chain and kappa/lambda light chain loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis showed that hybridomas prepared from spleen cells of immunised mice expressed exclusively one of the six VH genes (VH1-2) present in the YAC transgene with different D/J rearrangements, and secrete fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that recognised the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-specific IgM proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further studies of the reactivity of the monoclonal anti-human Id-IgM antibodies revealed that they are specific for the individual protein of each patient and probably react with idiotypic determinants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one case studied, the antibody recognised specifically the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell expressing the corresponding idiotypic IgM and lysed those cells in the presence of complement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is the first example of a human monoclonal antibody with such characteristics and may be of further use in the therapy of patients with B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
