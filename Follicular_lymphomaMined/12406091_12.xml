<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The chemokine/chemokine receptor pair CXCL13/CXCR5 is required for the architectural organization of B cells within lymphoid follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we showed that CXCL13 was secreted by FL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FL cells expressed CXCR5 and migrated in response to CXCL13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we observed a synergistic effect between CXCL13 and CXCL12 (SDF-1), a chemokine produced by stromal cells in lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The production of CXCL13 by FL cells and CXCL12 by stromal cells probably directs and participates in the accumulation of FL cells within specific anatomic sites </plain></SENT>
