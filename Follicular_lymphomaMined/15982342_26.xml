<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study the clinical utility of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for IGH translocations, we reviewed 1032 patients with a presumptive diagnosis of CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six (7%) patients had IGH translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pathology and clinical data were available for the 24 patients evaluated at the Mayo Clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten (42%) patients had IGH/cyclin D1 fusion and were diagnosed with mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotype was typical of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> in three of these patients and atypical for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient had biclonal disease with typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> and CLL with IGH/BCL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven (46%) patients had IGH/BCL-2 fusion including the patient with biclonal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of these patients had leukaemic phase follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and nine patients had CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median progression-free survival of patients with CLL and IGH/BCL-2 translocation was 20.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The two patients with IGH/BCL-3 fusion (one of these also had IGH/BCL-11a) had rapid disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The IGH partner gene was not identified in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that use of an IGH probe in FISH analysis of monoclonal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo> improves diagnostic precision and could have prognostic value in patients with CLL </plain></SENT>
