<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicle center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is among the most radioresponsive of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess whether this radioresponsiveness might be a result of a compromised ability of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells to accomplish the biologically-effective repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), we have measured i) the extent of the mechanical rejoining of radiation-induced DSBs in biopsy-derived follicle center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and ii) the fidelity with which nuclear protein extracts from these cells rejoin restriction enzyme-induced DSBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell suspensions derived from two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> biopsies, designated FCL1 and FCL2, as well as two established human <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo> cell lines, M059J and M059K, were exposed to 30 Gy of gamma-rays and evaluated for their ability to rejoin DSBs using a Southern transfer-pulsed-field gel electrophoresis assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fidelity of rejoining of restriction enzyme-induced DSBs was assessed using a cell-free plasmid reactivation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> suspensions rejoined DSBs relatively slowly and exhibited a similar phenotype to the known DSB-rejoining deficient M059J line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of DSB <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">mis</z:e>-rejoining in the cell-free plasmid reactivation assay was also similar in M059J and FCL2 cells and was considerably ( approximately 6-fold) higher than in M059K cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because of insufficient numbers of cells, we were unable to perform this assay with the FCL1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These limited data suggest that follicle center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells may be intrinsically deficient in performing the biologically-effective rejoining of DSBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such a deficiency might contribute to the radioresponsiveness of this disease and may be exploitable in the development of improved treatment strategies, such as radioimmunotherapy </plain></SENT>
