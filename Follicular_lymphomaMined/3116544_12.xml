<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent molecular analyses of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> carrying the t(8;14) chromosome translocation have indicated that a dichotomy exists regarding the molecular mechanisms by which the translocations occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumors</z:e> carry translocations that apparently arise due to mistakes in the immunoglobulin isotype-switching process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there is evidence that the translocations of most endemic Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> occur as a consequence of aberrant V-D-J recombination of variable, diversity, and joining gene segments, catalyzed by the recombinase enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon was first noted in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo> of the B-cell lineage and has been described in T-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each of these cases, analysis of the nucleotide sequence at chromosome breakpoints demonstrated the involvement of immunoglobulin heavy chain JH or T-cell-receptor alpha-chain J alpha gene segments in the translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We now have cloned and sequenced both the 8q- and 14q+ translocation breakpoints deriving from the t(8;14) translocation of the endemic Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line Daudi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data show that the translocation resulted from a reciprocal exchange between the DH region on chromosome 14 and sequences far 5' of the MYC protooncogene on chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Features of the nucleotide sequences surrounding the breakpoint further implicate the V-D-J joining machinery in the genesis of chromosome translocations in endemic Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and, more generally, in other lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> as well </plain></SENT>
