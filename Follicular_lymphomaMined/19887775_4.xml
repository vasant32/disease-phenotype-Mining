<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) allows physicians to stratify patients into groups with distinct prognoses, however its ability to predict the treatment efficacy has not been fully investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to validate on this respect the FLIPI system in an independent cohort and compare it with the International Prognostic Index (IPI) used for aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Records from patients referred to our unit with a diagnosis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data required for FLIPI and IPI scores were collected along with data regarding first-line chemotherapy and time to treatment failure (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi>) and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 162 patients screened, 130 were assessable for both (FLIPI and IPI) scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OS for low-risk (LR) patients identified either with IPI or FLIPI was significantly longer compared to intermediate-risk (IR) and high-risk (HR) groups, with FLIPI allowing a more even patient distribution among the risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For patients receiving first-line chemotherapy within 6 months of diagnosis, a low FLIPI score was associated with a longer <z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi> (3-year <z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi> rates: 68.0, 33.7 and 31.0% for FLIPI-defined LR, IR and HR patients, respectively, p = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data support the prognostic value of both IPI and FLIPI, with FLIPI demonstrating a more convenient patient distribution among risk classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A low FLIPI score was also associated with a longer <z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This might partially contribute to a more favourable prognosis </plain></SENT>
