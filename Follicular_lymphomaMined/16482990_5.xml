<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the diagnostic significance of the kappa/lambda ratio in germinal center (GC) B cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000872'>Hashimoto thyroiditis</z:hpo> (HT), we used 4-color flow cytometry to immunophenotype 27 samples (21 patients) of well-characterized HT B-cell clonality was analyzed further by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) and bcl-2/IgH fusion genes using DNA extracted from aspirate smears and/or paraffin-embedded tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By flow cytometric analysis, the CD10+ GC B cells had a higher mean +/- SD kappa/lambda ratio than the CD10- B cells (5.1 +/- 3.3 vs 2.0 +/- 0.8; P &lt; .0001, Student t test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 18 samples (67%), CD10+ GC B cells had a kappa/lambda ratio greater than 3.07 (the upper limit of kappa/lambda ratio reported in reactive nodes; range, 3.2-14.4 in the 18 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases tested by PCR showed no evidence of a clonal proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of 21 cases developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> during clinical follow-up of up to 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The kappa/lambda ratio of CD10+ GC B cells in HT can be skewed markedly beyond that reported in reactive lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding frequently is present in HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pathologists should be familiar with this phenomenon to prevent misdiagnosis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in patients with HT </plain></SENT>
