<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic studies were performed on lymph node biopsies from 60 patients with indolent (low grade) non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two of the 39 successfully cultured biopsies had abnormal clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 32 abnormal clones represented the following histologies: seven small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (SL), eight follicular small cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FSC), 14 follicular mixed, small cleaved, and large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FM), and three composite <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the composite <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had FSC/DSC (diffuse small cleaved cell) and the other two FM/DM (diffuse mixed, small cleaved and large cell) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven of the 32 biopsies were immunologically typed, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were B cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clones <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> exhibited more structural than numerical abnormalities, and there was no difference in the modal chromosome number of the abnormal clones found in each histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biopsies with no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells were more frequently found in the SL histology (71%) than in the two follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> groups (54%-55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A translocation of the 14q32 segment was the most common abnormality found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three histologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> a t(14;18)(q32;q21) was seen in 52% (13 of 25) of these patients, this translocation was not observed in the SL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall 84% (21 of 25) of the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients had abnormalities of 14q32 and/or 18q21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other specific abnormalities included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008626" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anomalies of chromosome</z:e> #3 in FM, an abnormal 10q in FSC and FM <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and a high incidence of +18 and chromosome #1 abnormalities in patients with t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presence of specific chromosome abnormalities in the indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients suggests a relationship between certain karyotypic features and histology </plain></SENT>
