<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with complete remission (CR) rate, length of survival, and time to treatment failure (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi>) after relapse are not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed such factors by multivariate analysis in a retrospective review of 95 patients with relapsed LGFL treated with investigational chemotherapy regimens at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CR rate after therapy was 22%; the likelihood of achieving CR was inversely associated with the number of previous treatment failures (P less than 0.001) and serum LDH level (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both the presence of constitutional symptoms and a history of more than two previous treatment failures were associated with shortened survival and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> level was also significantly associated with survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prognostic models for survival and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi> were derived to define patient groups with different projected outcomes after therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relapsed disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of this study can be used to select patients for new investigational treatments and to evaluate the outcome of such therapies </plain></SENT>
