<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This, like similar chemotherapeutic regimens, induces response rates of 60% to 80%, with a median response duration of under 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against CD20, is active in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previously untreated patients with stages III to IV follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were randomly assigned to receive either 8 cycles of CVP plus rituximab (R-CVP; n = 162) or CVP (n = 159) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall and complete response rates were 81% and 41% in the R-CVP arm versus 57% and 10% in the CVP arm, respectively (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 30 months, patients treated with R-CVP had a very significantly prolonged time to progression (median 32 months versus 15 months for CVP; P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median time to treatment failure was 27 months in patients receiving R-CVP and 7 months in the CVP arm (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rituximab did not add significantly to the toxicity of CVP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The addition of rituximab to the CVP regimen significantly improves the clinical outcome in patients with previously untreated advanced follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, without increased toxicity </plain></SENT>
