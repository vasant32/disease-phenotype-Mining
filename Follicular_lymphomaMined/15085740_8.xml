<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) can be graded on fine needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> (FNA) biopsies by determining the percentage of centroblasts in the neoplastic follicles on the smears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Eighty-nine cases of histologically confirmed cases of FL, including 31 grade 1, 46 grade 2 and 12 grade 3, were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Proliferative index (PI) by DNA image analysis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DIA</z:e>) and Ki-67 labeling index (LI) were obtained on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A minimum of 200 cells were counted per case (range, 200-800 cells) at 40x magnification, and the number of large cells (centroblasts) was expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells counted within the follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentage of centroblasts in the follicular aggregates was 9.7 +/- 2.9% in grade 1 FLs, 24.7 +/- 5.6% in grade 2 and 48.4 +/- 7.5% in grade 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These differences were significant (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA image analysis of PI and Ki-67 LI differed significantly between grade 1 FLs and grade 2 and 3 FLs (P &lt; .05), but there were no significant differences between grade 2 and 3 FLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Determining the percentage of centroblasts in the follicular aggregates on FNA specimens is a good method of grading FLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using the percentage of centroblasts per follicular structure, FL grades 1, 2 and 3 were adequately distinguished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PI by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DIA</z:e> and Ki-67 LI clearly distinguished FL grade 1 from FL grades 2 and 3; however, it did not clearly distinguish between grades 2 and 3 </plain></SENT>
