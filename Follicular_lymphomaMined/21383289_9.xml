<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Small series with limited follow-up have suggested primary follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the duodenum (FL-D) to be an indolent disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our experience on a large series of patients followed for a median time period of longer than 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study comprised 63 patients with primary FL-D defined as stage I disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy and detailed pathologic work-up was performed at diagnosis and at restaging to monitor the behavior of the neoplastic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histologically, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 63 patients had FL, low grade (1 to 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Duodenal endosonography demonstrated lesions confined to mucosa/submucosa in 19 of 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At an overall median follow-up of 77 months (range, 12 to 177 months), only two untreated patients had developed nodal disease, the remaining 61 patients never experienced extrasmall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal disease</z:e> and large cell transformation did not occur at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 24 patients followed by watch and wait strategy, seven showed spontaneous complete regression and 17 had stable disease; radiotherapy resulted in complete regression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 19 patients; anti-CD20 antibody monotherapy achieved complete regression in four patients and stable disease in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Various chemotherapy protocols in eight patients caused complete regression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them, but local relapses occurred in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patients required surgery or died of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings characterize primary FL-D as a remarkably indolent FL variant, which, even left untreated, does not develop tumorous growth, very rarely disseminates (two of 63 patients) and does not transform to high grade disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A watch and wait approach appears to be the most sensible strategy </plain></SENT>
