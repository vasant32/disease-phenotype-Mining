<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Despite high initial remission rates, most <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> relapse and require further therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> (mTOR) pathway is a validated target in mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but has not been extensively evaluated in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a phase II trial of single-agent temsirolimus 25-mg weekly in patients with relapsed aggressive and indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary objective was overall and complete response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified by histology: group A (diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), group B (follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), and group C (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and other indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients were treated, with outcome strongly dependent on histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group A had an overall and complete response rate of 28.1% and 12.5%, respectively, and median progression-free survival (PFS) of 2.6 months and median overall survival (OS) of 7.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group B had overall and complete response rates of 53.8% and 25.6%, respectively, and median PFS of 12.7 months; median OS has not yet been reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group C had a partial response rate of 11% with no complete responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was mainly mild and/or reversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> and mucositis; however, four patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032285" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PNEUM">pneumonitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Single-agent temsirolimus has significant activity in both diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, although the durability of responses and PFS are longer for patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of substantial activity of temsirolimus in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> other than mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and supports further evaluation of mTOR as a target in these diseases </plain></SENT>
