<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previously, we have shown that patients with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) transplanted with contaminated bone marrow (BM) generally have a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether this is also the case when peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) grafts are used is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-three patients with chemosensitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade 3 (FLgr3) were treated with high-dose therapy (HDT) and autologous stem cell support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine patients received purged grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) for either the BCL2/IgH translocation or allele specific oligonucleotide (ASO) QRT-PCR for the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) complementarity-determining region 3 were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine of 25 (36%) PBPC grafts contained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells as tested by QRT-PCR, including two grafts purged by CD34(+) cell enrichment combined with B-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The level of contamination of the PBPC/CD34(+) cells ranged from 0 to 8.28% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No relationship could be shown between the total number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells infused and relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving PCR-positive or PCR-negative PBPC grafts had similar progression-free survival (PFS) (P = 0.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, a significant difference was seen in PFS and overall survival (OS) for the patients given &gt;/=6.1 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg compared with those given &lt;6.1 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg (P = 0.01 and P &lt; 0.05 respectively) </plain></SENT>
