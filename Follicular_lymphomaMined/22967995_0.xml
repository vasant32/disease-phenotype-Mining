<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This analysis of postmenopausal women examines the relationship between postmenopausal hormone therapy and NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Self-reported use of postmenopausal hormone therapy from 2094 postmenopausal women with NHL and 2731 without were pooled across nine case-control studies (1983-2005) from North America, Europe and Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Study-specific odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) estimated using logistic regression were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postmenopausal women who used hormone therapy were at decreased risk of NHL (pooled OR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.69-0.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risks were reduced when the age of starting was 50 years or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no clear trend with number of years of use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Current users were at decreased risk while those stopping over 2 years before diagnosis were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Having a hysterectomy or not did not affect the risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Favourable effects were present for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (pooled OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.54-0.80) and FL (pooled OR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.66-1.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Postmenopausal hormone therapy, particularly used close to menopause, is associated with a decreased risk of NHL </plain></SENT>
