<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe the association of 2 types of small B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with different morphologic and immunophenotype patterns inside the same lymph node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Morphologically distinct zones were detected and studied with immunohistochemistry analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of the areas examined were characteristic of classic mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (CD20+, CD5+, cyclin D1+) with nodular and mantle zone areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, other areas had the morphologic and immunohistochemistry pattern of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (CD20+, CD10+, Bcl2+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction detection of both Bcl-1 MTC and Bcl-2 MBR rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA degradation in fixed tissue prevented a complete polymerase chain reaction analysis of immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangements, but a single immunoglobulin H rearrangement was detected at the FR3 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings confirm the presence of a monoclonal cell population but do not demonstrate the same clonal origin for both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> populations </plain></SENT>
