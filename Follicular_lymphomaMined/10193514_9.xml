<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18) (q32;q21) translocation, which juxtaposes the bcl-2 oncogene on chromosome 18 and the JH segment of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) genes on chromosome 14, is found frequently in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A sensitive semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect t(14;18) translocation in bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood lymphocytes from 48 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 137 additional individuals peripheral blood lymphocytes only were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cells carrying bcl-2/JH rearrangements were detected in about a quarter of the bone marrow samples and half of the peripheral blood lymphocyte samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In seven patients, t(14;18) positive cells were found in both the bone marrow and peripheral blood lymphocyte samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The size of the PCR products and bcl-2/JH DNA sequence analysis showed that the same t(14;18) carrying clone was present in the bone marrow and the corresponding peripheral blood lymphocyte samples in three of these seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some patients had more than one bcl-2/JH rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between age and the translocation incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cells carrying the t(14;18) translocation were present in peripheral blood lymphocyte samples with a similar incidence--between 47% and 52% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups from 20 to 79 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients older than 80 years had a lower (37%) but not significantly different incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that patients affected by non-lymphoid diseases may have several t(14;18) carrying cells and some of them undergo a clonal expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Whether individuals with t(14;18) positive cells are at a higher risk of lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> remains unanswered and further epidemiological studies are required </plain></SENT>
