<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A frequent chromosomal translocation in mature B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> affects band 3q27 and results in the deregulation of the B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 6 (BCL6) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two breakpoint clusters have been described thus far, the major breakpoint region (MBR) and an alternative breakpoint region (ABR) that is located 245-285 kb 5' to BCL6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Translocation at the MBR predominates in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, whereas translocation at the ABR is reported to be frequently associated with grade 3B follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, translocation at the ABR has not been studied in a large series of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, particularly t(14;18)-negative follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we studied BLC6 rearrangements at the MBR and ABR by using break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes in 142 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including 63 t(14;18)-negative and 79 t(14;18)-positive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conventional cytogenetic (karyotype) analysis was also performed in 58 of the 63 t(14;18)-negative cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BCL6 rearrangement was found in 26% of t(14;18)-negative and 19% of t(14;18)-positive follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>t(14;18)-negative cases showed a high frequency of rearrangement at the ABR (12%) with an ABR/MBR ratio of 0.86, compared with only 5% with an ABR/MBR ratio of 0.36 in the t(14;18)-positive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BCL6 rearrangements were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> grades of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but were most frequent in grade 3 t(14;18)-negative follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis had a higher sensitivity for detecting BCL6 rearrangements than conventional cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, BCL6 rearrangements occur at a similar frequency in t(14;18)-negative follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, t(14;18)-negative follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> appears to have a higher frequency of rearrangement at the ABR compared with t(14;18)-positive follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is important to perform FISH analysis with ABR to determine possible involvement of BCL6 rearrangement in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, especially in t(14;18)-negative cases </plain></SENT>
