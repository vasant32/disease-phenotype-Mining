<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study the distribution of high and low expressing TNF alleles at the TNF (-308) and LTalpha (+252) polymorphic sites in 121 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 88 control individuals has been analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A reduction in high expressing haplotypes in patients compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls was found (P = 0.055), with no significant difference observed in response rate or overall survival between patients with high or low expressing haplotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the TNF locus, or an adjacent locus within the MHC region, is an important genetic risk factor in this disease </plain></SENT>
