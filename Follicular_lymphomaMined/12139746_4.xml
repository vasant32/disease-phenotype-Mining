<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the relative value of each tissue, MBR t(14;18) was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction in 52 simultaneous paired PB and BM samples from 38 FL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 79% of sample pairs taken in remission (n = 19) or when no morphological disease was evident in the BM (n = 29) had t(14;18) copy number within one log difference and the median difference was small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that, in remission, PB may be adequately monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In general, however, higher copy number was detected in BM than in the corresponding PB sample </plain></SENT>
