<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analysed our experience of the value of flow cytometry (FC) as an additional tool for the diagnosis of lymphoproliferative processes in the setting of a university cytology division with a busy fine needle cytology service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive cytological specimens with FC over a period of 3 years were retrospectively analysed and correlated with histology and follow-up if available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FC was performed with the following antibodies: CD3, CD4, CD8, CD2, CD7, CD19, CD5, CD10, CD23, lambda and kappa chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 299 probes (273 fine needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspirations</z:hpo> and 26 fluids from 285 patients), 179 cases (60%) were diagnosed as reactive, 91 cases (30%) as malignant or suspicious and 29 cases (10%) as inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of histological examination of the lymph nodes were available in 41 of 91 (45%) malignant or suspicious cases and in 13 of 179 (7%) reactive cytological diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytologically diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> was confirmed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> histologically examined cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 12 of 13 reactive cytological cases (92%), a benign process was diagnosed histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 34 of 299 cases (11%) additional molecular investigations of B-cell clonality or specific translocations were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> most frequently diagnosed were follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, followed by mantle cell and marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Correlation with histology showed a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 100% for cytology in our series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FC is an important additional tool in the cytological diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The combined approach has a high diagnostic value that allows a reliable subclassification of low grade B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
