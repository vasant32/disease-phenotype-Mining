<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Malignant B cells can manipulate the microenvironment by skewing the differentiation of immune cells, attracting regulatory T cells or suppressive monocytes, or secreting cytokines that promote an immunosuppressive environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The importance of the microenvironment in FL has been demonstrated using methodologies such as gene expression profiling, which has shown that the nature of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> microenvironment predicts survival in patients with FL and may influence the response to immunotherapy and risk of transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Strategies that both enhance an effective antitumor response and reverse immunosuppression and dysfunction will be essential in the development of effective immunotherapeutic approaches in this disease </plain></SENT>
