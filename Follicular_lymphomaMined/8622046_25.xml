<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to establish a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique for the detection of t(14;18)(q32;q21), characteristic for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Kiel classification: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> centrocytic [cb-cc] <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: After the FISH system had been established, parallel studies of lymph node biopsy specimens from 30 patients with cb-cc <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and from 32 patients with nonneoplastic lymphoproliferation were performed by means of chromosome analysis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and FISH analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two differently labeled yeast-artificial-chromosome (YAC) probes that contained the entire bcl-2 gene and the C-region of the immunoglobulin H (IgH) gene, respectively, were used to detect t(14;18) by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The presence of the translocation is indicated by a red (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37990">Cy3</z:chebi>)/green (fluorescien isothiocyanate [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>]) double signal, which corresponds to the IgH/bcl-2 fusion gene, whereas in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells the signals are separate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control studies showed that the double signal is visible in less than 1% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis was able to identify the t(14;18) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of cb-cc <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> we studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> bcl-2 breakpoints can be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combined immunophenotyping and interphase cytogenetics demonstrated that t(14;18) was restricted to CD22+ B lymphocytes and never occurred in CD3+ T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In four of 32 cases of nonneoplastic lymphoproliferation, t(14;18) was also detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FISH turned out to be the most sensitive method to detect t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our FISH results confirm PCR data from other groups that found evidence for the presence of t(14;18) in nonneoplastic lymphoproliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It needs to be determined whether, in morphologically nonneoplastic processes, t(14;18) is associated with an increased risk for the development of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
