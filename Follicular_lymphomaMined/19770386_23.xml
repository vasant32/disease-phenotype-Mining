<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine overall response rate (ORR), time to progression (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>), and duration of response (DOR) with twice-weekly/weekly <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> plus rituximab, and evaluate safety/tolerability, in patients with relapsed or refractory CD20(+) follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) or marginal-zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned (minimization method) to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> 1.3 mg/m(2) twice weekly (days 1, 4, 8, and 11; 21-day cycle, five cycles; arm A) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> 1.6 mg/m(2) weekly (days 1, 8, 15, and 22; 35-day cycle, three cycles; arm B) plus rituximab 375 mg/m(2) weekly for 4 weeks (both arms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Response/progression was determined by International Workshop Response Criteria using oncologist/radiologist-adjudicated data from independent radiology review and investigator assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-one patients (arm A, n = 41; arm B, n = 40) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dose-intensity was higher in arm A; mean total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> received was similar between arms (18.5 and 17.1 mg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In arm A, ORR was 49% (14% complete response [CR]/CR unconfirmed [CRu]), median <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> was 7.0 months, and median DOR was not reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In arm B, ORR was 43% (10% CR/CRu), and median <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>/DOR were 10.0/9.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The weekly combination regimen seemed better tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 or worse adverse events seemed more common in arm A (54%) versus arm B (35%), including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (10% v 0%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> (10% v 5%), but <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> seemed less frequent (7% v 15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No grade 4 toxicities were reported in arm B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> plus rituximab regimens seem feasible in relapsed or refractory indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The more convenient weekly combination regimen is being compared with single-agent rituximab in an ongoing phase III study in relapsed FL </plain></SENT>
