<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the last years, a number of studies have identified different types of lymphoid lesions sharing pathological and molecular features of both benign and malignant processes that are difficult to interpret </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A group of these lesions correspond to atypical <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasias</z:mp>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasias</z:hpo>, atypical marginal zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasias</z:mpath>, and florid reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasias</z:mp> of the lower female genital tract in which immunoglobulin light chain restriction with or without clonal IGH rearrangements may be found in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, these lesions are usually self-limited and do not evolve to an overt lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A second group of lesions are clonal expansions of cells with phenotypic or molecular features of well-defined lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, or mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, occurring in otherwise healthy individuals or in the context of reactive lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this review, we discuss the criteria to distinguish these lesions from overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and the current recommendations for the management of the individuals in which these lesions are found </plain></SENT>
