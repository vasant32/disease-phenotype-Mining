<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As primary intestinal FL is increasingly being recognized, we have performed a study to investigate the usefulness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG-PET for staging of extranodal FL within the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In eight patients with a diagnosis of FL localized in the duodenum (six cases in stage I and one each in stages II and IV, respectively) whole body <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG-PET scans were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients with duodenal FL were rated WHO grade 1 and one had FL grade 3, while both patients with secondary spread had FL WHO grade 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were imaged before initiation of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with primary duodenal FL showed pathologically elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG-PET findings were not influenced by histological grade or proliferative activity of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG-PET is not useful for clinical assessment of primary duodenal FL </plain></SENT>
