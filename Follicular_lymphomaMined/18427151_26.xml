<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We hypothesized that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) could potentiate the clinical activity of rituximab given its individual and cooperative effects on Fc gamma RIIa- and Fc gamma RIIIa-expressing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A phase II clinical study combining GM-CSF and rituximab was initiated in patients with relapsed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) to determine the clinical and biologic responses, as well as safety of the combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty three patients with relapsed FL were treated with GM-CSF 5 microg/kg/d on days 1 to 8 and rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on day 5 of each 21-day cycle for four cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical response and tolerability were examined according to international criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biologic monitoring included evaluation of immune cells involved in rituximab activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 33 evaluated patients, a 70% overall response rate (complete response plus complete response unconfirmed, 45%) and a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 16.5 months were achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcome was influenced by the quality of response and the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI), where low- and intermediate-risk FLIPI groups were associated with significantly better PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After treatment there was a significant increase in granulocyte and monocyte counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Examination of dendritic cell response showed an overall increase in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, especially in non-complete response patients, after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Addition of GM-CSF did not impair tolerance to rituximab, and adverse events were rare and mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: GM-CSF plus rituximab results in high response rates, along with a tolerable safety profile in patients with relapsed or progressive FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The improved efficacy over rituximab monotherapy may be due to increases seen in monocyte, granulocyte, and dendritic cell populations </plain></SENT>
