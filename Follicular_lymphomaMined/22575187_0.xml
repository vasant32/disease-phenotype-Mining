<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Review of the three misdiagnosed cases <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and exploring the causes of misdiagnosis through reviewing their clinics, histopathology and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Case 1 of lymphocyte rich classical Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LRCHL</z:e>) was misdiagnosed as follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) initially, the RS cells were overlooked morphologically and wrongly determined BCL-2 and CD20-positive cells as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells immunohistochemically; also once misdiagnosed as nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NLPHL</z:e>) because the CD20-negative RS misjudged cells as the positives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case 2 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells expressed TdT, CD7 and CD43 unspecifically, which misdiagnosed as T-cell lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (T-LBL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case 3 of type B1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100522'>thymoma</z:hpo> was misdiagnosed as T-LBL, because CK wasn't expressed satisfactorily resulting in neglecting neoplastic epithelial cells, and lymphocytes in the background were TdT and CD99-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> should be based on <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, immunohistochemistry, clinics, and genetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the correct judgment of immunohistochemical staining is essential to make right diagnosis </plain></SENT>
