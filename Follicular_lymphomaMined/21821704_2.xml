<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) T-cell microenvironment plays a critical role in the biology of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore determined the lineage, differentiation state, and functional potential of FL-infiltrating CD4(+) T-helper cells (T(H)) compared with reactive and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymph node (NLN) T(H) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relative to NLNs, FL cells have decreased proportions of naive and central memory but increased proportions of effector memory T(H) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We further show differences in the distribution and anatomical localization of CXCR5(+) T(H) populations that, on the basis of transcription factor analysis, include both regulatory and follicular helper T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On Staphylococcus enterotoxin-B stimulation, which stimulates T cells through the T-cell receptor, requires no processing by APCs, and can overcome regulator T cell-mediated suppression, the proportion of uncommitted primed precursor cells, as well as T(H)2 and T(H)17 cells is higher in FL cells than in reactive lymph nodes or NLNs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the proportion of T(H)1 and polyfunctional T(H) cells (producing multiple cytokines simultaneously) is similar in FL cells and NLNs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that, although T(H)-cell differentiation in FL is skewed compared with NLNs, FL T(H) cells should have the same intrinsic ability to elicit antitumor effector responses as NLN T(H) cells when <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressive mechanisms are attenuated </plain></SENT>
