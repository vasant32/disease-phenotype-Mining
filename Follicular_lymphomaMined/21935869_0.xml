<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although vascular endothelial growth factor is a well-known proangiogenic factor, its impact on B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to evaluate vascular endothelial growth factor expression in subtypes of B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: Fifty-one patients with diagnoses of low and high grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were randomly selected and proper slides were immunostained with vascular endothelial growth factor antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of positive cells was recorded as the vascular endothelial growth factor score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A cut-off point was determined by using the median vascular endothelial growth factor score of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients were subclassified as negative, weak or strong positive according to this cut-off point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study cohort included 26 women and 25 men, aged 5 to 82 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of low-grade patients diagnosed as grade I follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were 7 and 6; while the number of high grade patients diagnosed as diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were 29 and 9, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients (49.0%) showed strong and 10 patients (19.6%) showed weak vascular endothelial growth factor immunoreactivity, while 16 patients (31.4%) showed no staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference was found for vascular endothelial growth factor expression between subtypes of B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; as well as between low and high grade groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Further studies in large and specific series are needed to determine the role of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor related pathways in the development and progression of B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
