<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Rituximab is a genetically engineered antibody recognizing the CD20 antigen known to be expressed by more than 95% of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently the antibody has been approved for routine administration in primary extracutaneous, treatment-refractory or relapsed low-grade, follicular non-Hodgkin B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With regard to the pathogenetically related primary cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the so-called large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the leg represents a distinct, but rare subentity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In an 89-year-old, multimorbid patient who was affected by such a non-resectable CD20+ large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> limited to the skin of both lower legs, rituximab was used as a first-line monotherapy in order to avoid local or systemic toxicities inevitably linked to conventional treatment modalities, i.e., radio- or chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rituximab was administered at a dosage of 375 mg/m(2) i.v. eight times in weekly intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a premedication we used <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> 150 mg i.v. as well as loratadine 10 mg p.o </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>1 h before each rituximab infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The treatment was well tolerated without any adverse reactions, but was accompanied by a mild transient blood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The histologically proven, exophytic, multi-nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed a substantial regression already at 2 weeks after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the rituximab treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 8 weeks we observed a complete clinical remission which is now stabile for a follow-up period of 6 months without any maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our case observation demonstrates that an intensified, i.e. eightfold, rituximab application in weekly intervals may be a highly effective, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> target cell-specific first-line monotherapy in the management of primary cutaneous large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the leg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Given the rareness of the disease, the result as well as the possible contribution of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> premedication will have to be evaluated in a future, controlled, multi-centre study </plain></SENT>
