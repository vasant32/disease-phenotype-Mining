<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Responding patients could be randomized to no further treatment or maintenance treatment for up to 36 months with alpha interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complete remissions/CRu were more frequent in the CID arm (35% vs 24%) but the overall response rate was similar; 87/91 (96%) vs 86/92 (93%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (OS) did not differ between the two arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Time to treatment failure (TTTF) was prolonged in the CID arm, p = 0.03; median time 28 vs 19 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TTTF for the B-cell follicular group alone was for CID (77 patients) 33 months vs 18 months for CD (78 patients) </plain></SENT>
