<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HLA class II molecules play a key role in antigen presentation, ligation of which induces signal transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined 18 lymphoid cell lines (15 B cell and 3 T cell lines) to investigate the effects of ligation of HLA class II molecules on CD95-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the five immature B cell lines were sensitive to anti-CD95 mAb, and ligation of HLA class II molecules promoted CD95-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In seven B-blastoid cell lines, two Burkitt lines were resistant to anti-CD95 mAb in spite of high expression of CD95 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In three of five non-Burkitt B-blastoid lines, CD95-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was augmented by treatment with anti-HLA class II mAb, while the other two lines lacking CD95 were resistant to anti-CD95 mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three plasmacytic cell lines showed CD95-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, but enhancement by anti-HLA class I mAb was slight in one cell line and was not observed in the other two lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Out of three HLA class II antigen-positive T cell lines, CD95-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was observed to some degree in one call line but was not promoted by the treatment with anti-HLA class II mAb, and the other two cell lines were resistant to anti-CD95 mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ligation of HLA class II molecules did not alter CD95 expression in the five cell lines examined, except Su-DHL-4 originated from a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which showed slight up-regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, ligation of HLA class II molecules apparently promotes CD95-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in immature B cells and non-Burkitt B blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings highlight the role of HLA class II molecules in CD95-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, which may facilitate rapid clearance of functionally useless cells from the immune system and might be involved in negative selection of B cells </plain></SENT>
