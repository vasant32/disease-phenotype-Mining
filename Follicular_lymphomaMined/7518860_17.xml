<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of a sequential high-dose therapy with peripheral-blood progenitor-cell (PBPC) support in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since July 1991, we have included 30 patients (17 men and 13 women) with a median age of 41 years (range, 26 to 55) in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the time of study entry, 17 patients were in first and six in second or higher remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another six patients had relapse of disease and one had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PBPC were collected during filgrastim-supported leukocyte recovery following high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (ara-C)/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> (HAM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A median of two leukaphereses (range, one to seven) resulted in a median of 5.7 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg (range, 2.9 to 23.7 x 10(6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A distinct population of B-lymphoid progenitors (CD34+/CD19+) was not detectable in the autografts, and the content of CD19+ B cells was remarkably low, comprising a median of 0.07% of the mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the major breakpoint regions (MBR) of the bcl-2/immunoglobulin H (IgH) translocation, 22 patients had autografts positive for the t(14;18) translocation, whereas seven patients had PCR-negative transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The autograft of one patient could not be assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following myeloablative therapy, hematologic recovery was rapid without cytokine support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median times to reach a platelet count &gt; or = 20 x 10(9)/L and neutrophil count &gt; or = 0.5 x 10(9)/L were 11 and 13 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nonhematologic toxicity was moderate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients were alive in remission after a median follow-up duration of 6 months (range, 1 to 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of 22 patients autografted with t(14;18)-positive harvests, 11 had PCR-detectable cells in bone marrow and/or peripheral blood as long as 16 months posttransplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In contrast, six patients became PCR-negative between 3 and 16 months after reinfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Follow-up examinations with PCR data for the remaining five patients are not yet available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Conversion to PCR negativity in patients autografted with PCR-positive harvests suggests that the myeloablative regimen is effective and that any reinfused t(14;18)-positive cells may not be sustained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Because conventional chemotherapy provides no cure, we believe that high-dose therapy including total-body irradiation (TBI) should be explored in these particularly radiosensitive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
