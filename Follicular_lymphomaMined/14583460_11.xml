<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The result is the deregulated expression of bcl-2 and increased resistance to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regulation of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene is controlled in part by four DNase I-hypersensitive regions located 3' of the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that these four enhancer regions also contribute to bcl-2 up-regulation in t(14;18) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The enhancers are able to individually or in combination activate bcl-2 promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30607,30610">HS4</z:chebi> enhancer region was found to impart the largest positive effect on the bcl-2 promoter, activating it by 6-fold, whereas addition of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29917">HS1</z:chebi>,2 region with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30607,30610">HS4</z:chebi> increased promoter activity by approximately 9-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nuclear factor kappaB binding sites were shown to be primarily responsible for the positive activity contributed by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29917">HS1</z:chebi>,2 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30607,30610">HS4</z:chebi> regions, and we observed the in vivo interaction of these factors with the human immunoglobulin heavy chain gene enhancer regions in t(14;18) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, two Sp1 binding sites in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30607,30610">HS4</z:chebi> were also found to positively influence bcl-2 activity, and Sp1 was observed to interact with the human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30607,30610">HS4</z:chebi> enhancer in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the interactions of the nuclear factor kappaB and Sp1 transcription factors with the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer region are important for bcl-2 deregulation in t(14;18) cells </plain></SENT>
