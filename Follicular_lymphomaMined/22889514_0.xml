<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and two patients with NHL treated in a developing country were analyzed: 28 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) and 74 with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated upfront with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHOP) or R-CHOP; the decision to employ R depending solely on the ability of patients to defray it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In DLCL, 42 were given CHOP and 32 R-CHOP, whereas in FL, 19 were given CHOP and 9 R-CHOP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The impact of the addition of R was found to be clearer in FL than in DLCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with DLCL, the overall survival (OS) was 87% at 80 months for those treated with R-CHOP and 84% at 145 months for those treated with CHOP (not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with FL, the OS was 89% at 88 months for those treated with R-CHOP and 71% at 92 months for those treated with CHOP (P = 0··05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, other variables which were identified to be associated with the OS were IPI and number of cycles in DLCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that R produced a mild positive impact in the OS of patients with FL, but not in those with DLCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since the addition of R results in a 36-fold increase in treatment costs, these observations may be important to decide therapeutic approaches in NHL patients living in underprivileged circumstances </plain></SENT>
