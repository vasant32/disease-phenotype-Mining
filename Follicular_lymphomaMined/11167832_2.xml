<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr-encoded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (EBER) 1-2 was positive in 70% of cells, and molecular analysis revealed the presence of EBV DNA and a monoclonal IgH gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case shows that the immunosuppression of multiple treatments may induce uncontrolled reactivation of a latent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e>, contributing to high-grade transformation in heavily treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
