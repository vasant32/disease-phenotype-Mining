<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients should have undergone conventional staging and have available PET baseline to be included.ResultsA total of 142 patients were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PET identified a higher number of nodal areas in 32% (46 of 142) of patients and more extranodal (EN) sites than computed tomography (CT) scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) score increased in 18% (26 of 142) and decreased in 6% (9 of 142) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, the impact of PET on modifying the stage was highest in patients with limited stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Actually, 62% (15 of 24) of cases with limited disease were upstaged with PET.ConclusionsThe inclusion of PET among staging procedures makes the evaluation of patients with FL more accurate and has the potential to modify therapy decision and prognosis in a moderate proportion of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further prospective clinical trials on FL should incorporate PET at different moments, and the therapeutic criteria to start therapy should be re-visited in the views of this new tool </plain></SENT>
