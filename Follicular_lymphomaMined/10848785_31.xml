<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A multicentre study was undertaken between January 1997 and January 1998 to assess the complete response rate (CR) and overall response rate (RR) to rituximab, a chimaeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy patients with previously treated FL received rituximab (375 mg/m2/week x4, by intravenous infusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Restaging studies were performed 1 and 2 months after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular monitoring for the presence of cells harbouring the Bcl-2/JH gene rearrangement in the peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) was performed before and after treatment using a two-step semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall RR was 32/70 (46%), being highest in patients who had received only one previous treatment (12/15, 80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, only two patients achieved a CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median duration of response was 11 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of 21 evaluable 'PCR-positive' patients (62%) became 'PCR-negative' in PB and/or BM samples 1 month after rituximab, although this did not correlate with clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment was generally well tolerated, although one patient developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038325" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Stevens-Johnson syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rituximab was shown to be active in FL, and in some cases PB and/or BM became PCR negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Studies in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy to increase the CR rate are warranted </plain></SENT>
