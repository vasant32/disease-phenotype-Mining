<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), where position 158 of FcγR-IIIa is heterozygous valine/phenylalanine or homozygous phenylalanine (F-carriers), have natural killer cells with lower binding affinity to IgG than valine homozygote patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, F-carriers show less efficacy with rituximab treatment than patients homozygous for valine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LY2469298 is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting CD20, with human germline framework regions, and specific amino acid substitutions engineered into the Fc region to increase effector function in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This dose-escalation, phase I study was conducted to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of LY2469298 in Japanese patients with previously treated, CD20-positive FL who had not relapsed or progressed within 120 days of prior rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LY2469298 was administered by intravenous infusion at 100 or 375 mg/m(2) weekly for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were enrolled (median age, 60 years); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had previously been treated with rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine patients were F-carriers while one was homozygous for valine at position 158 of FcγRIIIa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patients developed dose-limiting toxicities, and the most frequent adverse events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>pyrexia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo>, chills and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five (50%) of the ten patients responded to LY2469298 treatment (three complete responses, one unconfirmed complete response and one partial response) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serum LY2469298 was eliminated in a biphasic manner and the pharmacokinetic profiles were not different from those in a preceding study in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, LY2469298 was well tolerated and clinical activity was observed in FL patients pretreated with rituximab, mostly consisting of F-carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of FL is warranted </plain></SENT>
