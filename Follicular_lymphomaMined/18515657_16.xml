<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although sensitive to treatment, the disease remains incurable and the reason why <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells invariably evade treatment, leading to clinical relapse, is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we tracked the clonal history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells by studying mutations introduced by activation-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminase on the switch mu region of the der(14)t(14;18) during the early phase of the class-switch recombination (CSR) process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed frequent intraclonal variations, suggesting that CSR often remains active after the acquisition of the fully transformed phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, mutations only rarely accumulated over time, but instead showed complex evolutionary scenarios and 2 different progression pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first pathway was a direct and rapid evolution from the dominant clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second was indirect, arising from earlier subclones usually after years of remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of these mechanisms might influence the future choice of treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
