<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We showed that freshly isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> infiltrating T cells (T-TILs) lack <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of these T cells with FL cells in the presence of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and/or costimulation via CD28 does not lead to T-cell activation and expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, when stimulated with FL cells preactivated via CD40, autologous T-TILs can be expanded by the addition of exogenous IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These T cells can be further expanded in vitro by the addition of exogenous IL-4, IL-7, or interferon-gamma, but not IL-12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Once activated, these T cells showed FL-directed cytotoxicity in four of five patients tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We concluded that autologous cytotoxic anti-FL-specific T cells exist, but can only be detected in vitro under optimized conditions for T-cell stimulation and expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that their frequency in vivo is either very low or that the microenvironment does not provide the necessary signals to activate these T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This model system allows dissection of the requisite conditions for activation and expansion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-directed cytotoxicity and may permit expansion of previously activated cytotoxic T cells for adoptive transfer </plain></SENT>
