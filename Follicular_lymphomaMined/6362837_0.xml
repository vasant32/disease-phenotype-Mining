<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Six cases are reported of a previously undescribed unusual composite variant of lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that is not readily classifiable by either the Rappaport or the Lukes and Collins classifications, or by the recently proposed Working Formulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cases are characterized by a partly nodular, partly diffuse proliferation of lymphoid cells surrounded by a separate, zonally distinct proliferation of large plasmacytoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latter cells are located in medullary and paracortical areas in lymph nodes and in the marginal zone of the white pulp and in the red pulp in the spleen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This distinct zonal characteristic was noted in the small bowel as well in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five of our six patients were male, and their ages ranged from 46 to 68 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three had a monoclonal serum IgM and one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0010702'>hyperglobulinemia</z:hpo> that was not further characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three had evidence of an altered immune state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, monoclonal IgM was demonstrated in involved tissues by an immunoperoxidase technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These cases are unusual because of the unique topographic segregation of the varying types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, and because of the association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030489" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paraproteinemia</z:e> with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The resemblance of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> to the plasma cell variant of giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymph node hyperplasia</z:hpo> with which two cases were originally confused, and to lymph nodes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, may be responsible for its lack of recognition </plain></SENT>
