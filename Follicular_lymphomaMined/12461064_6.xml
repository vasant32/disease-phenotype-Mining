<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cyclin D1 expression was evaluated in 11 healthy controls and 51 patients with B-LPD by flow cytometry using the 5D4 monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 25 cases, experiments were repeated up to four times with mononuclear cells (MNC) fixed in <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> for 1-120 days to evaluate the consistency of cyclin D1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry results were compared with fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) for the t(11;14) translocation in 19 patients and with immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e>-6 monoclonal antibody in nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A mean fluorescence intensity ratio (MFIR) of 4.8 was defined as the cut off point for positivity based on cyclin D1 expression in healthy controls (mean + 3 SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten patients overexpressed cyclin D1 by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These included five of eight patients with mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, four of 19 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, and one with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MFIR in the repeat experiments differed less than 25% in 20 of 25 patients and in no cases did it cross the cut off point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a good correlation between cyclin D1 expression by flow cytometry and FISH for t(11;14) in 15 of 19 patients and six of nine had concordant results with flow cytometry, FISH, and IHC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cyclin D1 expression remains fairly stable once MNC are fixed in <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> and the flow cytometric assay can be used for the routine screening of B-LPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further comparisons between flow cytometry, IHC, and FISH may be needed to ascertain the diagnostic value of the flow cytometric assay </plain></SENT>
