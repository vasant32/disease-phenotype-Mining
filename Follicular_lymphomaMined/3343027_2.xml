<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The histology was nodular lymphocytic poorly differentiated (NLPD) in 75 per cent, nodular mixed (NM) in 21 per cent and nodular histiocytic (NH) in 4 per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our patients appeared to have a higher proportion of NLPD and a lower proportion of NM <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> than the western series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients were analysed excluding the two patients with NH <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They had a median age of 50 and a male to female ratio of 0.92 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two per cent of them presented with asymptomatic lymph node enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty per cent had B symptoms and 32 per cent bulky <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twelve per cent had stage I disease, 2 per cent stage II, 30 per cent stage III and 56 per cent stage IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A high incidence of bone marrow involvement (48 per cent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> seven stage I-II patients responded to involved-field radiotherapy alone and none of them has relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 43 stage III-IV patients were treated with chemotherapy without deferral and a majority of them received CVP (51.1 per cent) or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> alone (34.9 per cent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The complete response rate of stage III-IV patients was 81 per cent and 26 per cent of the complete responders relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The 5-years disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (stage III and IV) were 50 per cent and 65 per cent respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The DFS curve showed a pattern of continuous relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Stage III patients appeared to have a better complete response rate, a lower relapse rate and superior disease-free survival than stage IV patients but the differences did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, the overall survival of stage III patients was significantly better than stage IV patients (p less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Other factors including sex, age, presence of bulky <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>, B symptoms, histologic subtypes and the chemotherapeutic regimes did not significantly affect their prognosis </plain></SENT>
