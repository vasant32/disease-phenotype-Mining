<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that high vegetable and fruit intake may reduce the risk of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) as vegetables and fruit are rich in <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to evaluate the interaction of vegetable and fruit intake with genetic polymorphisms in <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> pathway genes and NHL risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis was investigated in a population-based case-control study of NHL and NHL histologic subtypes in women from Connecticut, including 513 histologically confirmed incident cases and 591 randomly selected controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene-vegetable/fruit joint effects were estimated using unconditional logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The false discovery rate method was applied to adjust for multiple comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant interactions with vegetable and fruit intake were mainly found for genetic polymorphisms on nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS) genes among those with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two single nucleotide polymorphisms in the NOS1 gene were found to significantly modify the association between total vegetable and fruit intake and risk of NHL overall, as well as the risk of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When vegetables, bean vegetables, cruciferous vegetables, green leafy vegetables, red vegetables, yellow/orange vegetables, fruit, and citrus fruits were examined separately, strong interaction effects were narrowed to vegetable intake among patients with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that genetic polymorphisms in <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> pathway genes, especially in the NOS genes, modify the association between vegetable and fruit intake and risk of NHL </plain></SENT>
