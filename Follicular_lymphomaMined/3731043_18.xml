<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these, 179 (43%) patients had nodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and 183 (44%) had extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The commonest <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was diffuse large cell (27%), followed by large cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The histopathologic pattern was follicular in 18% of the nodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and in 5.3% of the extranodal forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common site of extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was the gastrointestinal tract (46.5%), followed by Waldeyer's ring (19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Small intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were three times more common than gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021071" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="IPSID">Immunoproliferative small intestinal disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPSID</z:e>) was diagnosed in 20 of 59 patients who had primary small intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 34 patients who had Waldeyer's ring <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 7 had gastrointestinal involvement at some time during the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were associated with poor prognostic factors: 82% were diffuse; 77% had advanced disease at presentation; 77% had intermediate- or high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; 40% had marrow involvement; and 46% had B symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In children, the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was Burkitt's, and 80% of pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study delineates the special features of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in the Middle East: The presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPSID</z:e>; the high incidence of extranodal forms, in particular the intestinal ones; and the rarity of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
