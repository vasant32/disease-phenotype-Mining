<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is pathologically categorised as a low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and histopathologically shows follicular proliferation of neoplastic B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the neoplastic follicles of FL, the presence of T cells, macrophages and follicular dendritic cells (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi>) suggests that these cells may promote a favourable environment for the growth of FL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because FL cells are generally associated with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> may be considered an important source of cytokines and chemokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> form the framework for germinal centres and also provide networks for nodules of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the gene expression in neoplastic follicles of FL and reactive follicles of reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> (RFH), we performed gene expression profiling of FL (n=5) and RFH (n=5) using complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray of cytokines/chemokines and their receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FL and RFH exhibited a diffuse down-regulated profile compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood cells, which were used as controls, although some genes displayed up-regulated profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hierarchical clustering analysis separated FL and RFH into two distinct groups based on their gene expression profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FL cases exhibited significantly higher expression of interleukin 3 receptor alpha (IL-3Ralpha) than RFH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, neoplastic follicles of FL frequently expressed IL-3Ralpha, especially in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi>, but not in FL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, IL-3Ralpha expression was rare or weak in the reactive follicles of RFH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest the importance of the micro-environment for FL cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies of cDNA microarray should provide new insight into the molecular pathology of FL and may allow the design of improved therapies </plain></SENT>
