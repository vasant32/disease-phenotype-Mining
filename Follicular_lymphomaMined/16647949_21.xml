<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a previous study, we subdivided this group in 3 subgroups based on (1) aberrations of the 3q27 region, (2) lack of 3q27 and t(14;18), and (3) the presence of a t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we further characterized the FL3B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that are currently part of the spectrum of FL in the WHO classification, taking into account other cytogenetical aberrations, immunohistochemistry for P53, bcl2, bcl6, and CD10, rearrangement of the proto-oncogene myc, and mutation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene TP53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With respect to P53, bcl2, bcl6 expression, myc rearrangement, and TP53 mutation, FL3B represents a homogeneous group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD10 expression and gain of chromosome 7, considered to be typical FL markers, were more common in the FL3B t(14;18)-positive subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lack of CD10 expression and gain of chromosome 7 in most cases in the other 2 subgroups suggest that those cases have a closer relation to diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
