<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) has recently emerged as a distinct clinicopathologic entity with characteristic molecular genetic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specifically, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> are clonal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and often harbor bcl-1 gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although this genetic profile is well documented, scant or no data are available on the molecular assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue as a sample source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to study bcl-1 and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangements (B-cell clonality) using formalin-fixed tissue from 12 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, 12 cases of low grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 5 cases of reactive lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> were studied as comparison controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A hemi-nested PCR assay was developed to identify major translocation cluster (MTC) bcl-1 gene rearrangements, whereas IgH gene rearrangements were evaluated by both a single-step and hemi-nested approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bcl-1 gene rearrangements were amplified in 4 of 12 (33%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, but in none of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With the hemi-nested approach, B-cell monoclonality was demonstrated in 11 of 12 (92%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>; 6 of 6 (100%) small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; 1 of 2 marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; 1 of 4 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; and 0 of 5 reactive lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasias</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When one-step PCR was used for B-cell clonality assessment, the overall detection rate was lower, specifically: 8 of 12 (67%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>; 4 of 6 (67%) small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; 1 of 2 marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; 0 of 4 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; and 0 of 5 reactive lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasias</z:mpath> were identified as monoclonal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that MTC bcl-1 gene rearrangements can be amplified from formalin-fixed tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, monoclonal B-cell populations from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> are better amplified with a hemi-nested approach rather than a single-step PCR assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With specialized nucleic acid isolation techniques and appropriate PCR protocol design, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue is an adequate source of DNA for assessing MTC bcl-1 and IgH gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
