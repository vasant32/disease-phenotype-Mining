<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nuclear areas are larger in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, where the invagination, if present, decreases in depth and increases in angle as the value of nuclear area becomes greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nuclei with such a large area and shallow invaginations are not present within the nonneoplastic germinal centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, no correspondence has been found between neoplastic and nonneoplastic nuclei with regard to the form of the invagination, that is, its symmetry and angle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is possible to argue that the neoplastic nuclei in nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are different from the nuclei found in the sequential pathway of reactive germinal centers </plain></SENT>
