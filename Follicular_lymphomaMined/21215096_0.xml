<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and ninety-four cases of gastrointestinal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were retrieved from the archival file </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical features and pathologic findings were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study for B-cell markers, T-cell markers, bcl-6, CD10, bcl-10, cyclin D1, TdT, MUM1 and Ki-67 was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The male-to-female ratio was 1.4:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The age of patients ranged from 8 to 85 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Amongst the 194 cases studied, 128 (66.0%) were diagnosed as diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, including 16 cases of large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> associated with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were also 40 cases (20.6%) of MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 8 cases (4.1%) of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 5 cases of (2.6%) of lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 3 cases (1.6%) of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 1 case of (0.5%) of B-lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 9 cases (4.6%) of indefinite type (including 5 biopsy cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The site of involvement included stomach (100 cases, 51.5%), small intestine (43 cases, 22.2%), ileocecal junction (26 cases, 13.4%), appendix (1 case, 0.5%), colon (21 cases, 10.8%) and rectum (3 cases, 1.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Amongst the 163 cases which had undergone surgical resection, 20 cases (12.3%) cases had invasion down to the mucosa, 20 cases (12.3%) down to the superficial muscular layer, 19 cases (11.6%) down to the deep muscular layer and 104 cases (63.8%) with full-thickness involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histologic examination showed lymphoepithelial lesions in 52 cases, residual lymphoid follicles in 29 cases, coagulative <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in 66 cases and nodular growth pattern in 30 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases were immunoreactive for B-cell marker CD20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was also various degrees of positivity for bcl-6, CD10, bcl-10, cyclin D1, TdT, MUM1 and Ki-67 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> can be subdivided into two main groups: large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and small B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The latter group often poses diagnostic pitfalls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Accurate pathologic typing requires correlation with histologic and immunohistochemical findings </plain></SENT>
