<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Accurate staging is critical to select patients with early-stage (I-II) follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ESFL) suitable for involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT) and to define the radiotherapy portal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the impact of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET on staging, treatment, and outcome for patients with ESFL on conventional staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty-two patients with untreated ESFL (World Health Organization Grade I-IIIa, or "low grade") following a minimum of physical examination, computerized tomography, and bone marrow examination (conventional assessment) and who had staging PET from June 1997 to June 2006 were studied retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stage allocation was based on routine imaging reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disease sites, stage, and management plan were recorded based on conventional assessment or conventional assessment plus PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FDG avidity was demonstrated in 97% of patients in whom disease was evident on conventional assessment after biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PET findings suggested a change of stage or management in 19 patients: 13 (31%) who were upstaged to Stage III-IV, altering ideal management from IFRT to systemic therapy, and 6 (14%) who had the involved field enlarged, including 4 upstaged from Stage I to II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these 19 cases, PET findings were considered true positive in 8 patients, indeterminate in 10, and false positive in only 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that ESFL is usually FDG-<z:chebi fb="156" ids="39214">avid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In routine practice, PET has the potential to upstage and thereby alter management in a high proportion of patients with apparent ESFL </plain></SENT>
