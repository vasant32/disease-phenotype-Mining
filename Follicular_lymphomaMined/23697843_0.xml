<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five patients with newly diagnosed FL were retrospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On two-color flow cytometric analysis, CD25 was detected on CD19+ and CD20+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD25 expression in FL tended to be higher than in reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, but was lower than in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with CD25+ FL (n=12) showed clinical features of elevated soluble IL-2R levels, B symptoms, and an advanced age compared with CD25- FL (n=73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in patients with CD25+ FL were significantly inferior to those with CD25- FL (ORR, 60 vs. 93%; 2-year PFS, 32 vs. 80.3%; 6-year OS, 47.4 vs. 85.9%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis demonstrated that CD25-positivity is an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD25+ FL may constitute a distinct subgroup associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> and an inferior prognosis </plain></SENT>
