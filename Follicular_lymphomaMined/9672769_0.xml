<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In 1994, the International <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Study Group proposed a "Revised European-American <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (REAL) Classification of Lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Neoplasms</z:hpo>." This classification system was developed because (1) new lymphoid disease entities have been recognized that are not part of the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute Working Formulation (WF) and (2) there was a need to develop a common classification system that could be used internationally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The REAL classification itself had never been tested, however, to determine whether it was reproducible or defined distinct clinicopathologic entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in the past two years, two studies were conducted by the South-west <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group (SWOG) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Committee and the Non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) Classification Project to validate the REAL classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The SWOG <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Committee reviewed the pathology and clinical course of 376 previously untreated patients with stage III or IV disease within WF categories A, B, C, D, or E who received full-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHOP) in SWOG studies 7204, 7426, and 7713 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No patients in this database had localized mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The NHL Classification Project performed a retrospective study of 1,403 consecutive patients with previously untreated NHL seen between 1988 and 1990 at nine sites around the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five expert hematopathologists reached a consensus diagnosis on every case by using histologic, clinical, and immunophenotypic data, and 20% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases were randomly reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most common diagnosis was diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (31%), which combines the large-cell and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> WF categories (WF G/H) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The next most common diagnosis was follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (22%; WF B, C, and D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Marginal zone B-cell (including MALT), peripheral T-cell, small B-lymphocytic, and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> each constituted between 5% and 10% of diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Primary mediastinal large B-cell, anaplastic large T/null cell, high-grade B-cell, Burkitt-like, and precursor T-lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> made up the remaining 10 most frequent diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The analyses conducted by the SWOG <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Committee and the NHL Classification Project have demonstrated that the REAL classification does define "real" clinical entities that can be diagnosed by expert hematopathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The understanding gained from study of "real" entities should permit hematologists/oncologists to better predict the clinical course of their patients and also to develop improved therapy </plain></SENT>
