<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate whether the analysis of immunoglobulin (Ig)/T cell receptor (TCR) rearrangements is useful in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a series of 107 consecutive cases with initial suspicion of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), Southern blot (SB) analysis of Ig/TCR rearrangements was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 98 of 100 histopathologically conclusive cases, Ig/TCR gene results were concordant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one presumed diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL) and one follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) case no clonality could be detected by SB analysis, or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at second stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the DLCL, sampling error might have occurred; the FL was revised after an initial diagnosis of reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In many of the histopathologically inconclusive cases Ig/TCR gene SB analysis was helpful, giving support for the histopathological suspicion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, because of a lack of (clinical) follow up data this could not be confirmed in a few cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Experienced haematopathologists or a pathologist panel can diagnose malignant versus reactive lesions in most cases without the need for Ig/TCR gene analysis and can select the 5-10% of cases that might benefit from molecular clonality studies </plain></SENT>
