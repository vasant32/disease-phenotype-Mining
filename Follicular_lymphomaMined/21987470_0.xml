<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate the effect of storage medium and time to processing on lymph node (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>) FNA viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> FNAs were distributed among Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI), Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) storage media, and viability was compared at 0, 4.5 and 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FC survival analysis showed viable cells (%): at 0 hrs: HBSS 83.6%, RPMI 87.7%, DMEM 87.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 4.5 hrs: HBSS 86.3%, RPMI 89.0%, DMEM 78.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 24 hrs: HBSS 82.7%, RPMI 86.7%, DMEM 77.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FNA from a peri-pancreatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> involved by grade 2 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was stored in RPMI at 4° C and analyzed at 1, 3, 5 and 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over 90% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were suitable for FC analysis at 1, 3, and 5 days after collection, decreasing to 76% at 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion: RPMI appears to be the optimal storage medium compared to DMEM and HBSS.An NHL FNA sample stored at 4° C remains suitable for FC analysis for up to 5 days </plain></SENT>
