<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This translocation probably constitutes a very early step in the development of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Besides the cytogenetic assay, t(14;18) detection can be achieved using either Southern blot or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since 1990, several publications have reported discrepancies between the results of cytogenetic and molecular analysis of t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using methods able to explore long DNA fragments, several authors reported breakpoints located outside the usual breakpoint regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, these techniques cannot be easily used in routine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to develop a simple PCR assay to amplify rearrangements usually not detected in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We selected a group of 83 patients with a t(14;18) on cytogenetic analysis: using usual probes and primers, 54/83 (65.1%) showed a MBR rearrangement, 7/83 (8.4%) were mcr positive and 22/83 (26.5%) remained negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among these 22 rearrangements, nine could be detected using this new PCR assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four breakpoints were located in a 20 bp area suggesting a recurrent breakpoint cluster close to an Alu repetitive sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, remaining negative cases (13/83, 15.6%) suggest that other breakpoints are located between the MBR and mcr regions </plain></SENT>
