<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Estimation of the frequency of t(14;18) in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> vary widely from 33 to 89% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no extensive data have been published on the frequency of t(14;18) in Turkish cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Representative tissue blocks from 67 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 12 cases of diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 11 cases of reactive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasias</z:mpath> were examined for the presence of this translocation using PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA probes capable of detecting rearrangement at both the major and minor break point regions were employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We could detect t(14;18) in 46 out of 67 cases (68.7%) of follicular and 25% of diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> 64.2% of these break points were at mbr and 4.5% were at the mcr region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Review of the literature showed that comparable results have been obtained previously using molecular techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data showed that despite the relative infrequency of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in the Turkish population these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> share a common molecular pathogenesis with involvement of bcl-2 gene and background incidence of such rearrangement is similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> populations, regardless the incidence of folicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
