<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Flow cytometry immunophenotyping (FCIP) is used for rapid, specific diagnosis of B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (BCLPDs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, cases may deviate from the typical immunophenotype; therefore, there is a need for adding new marker(s) for differentiating BCLPDs.Lately, few researches highlighted CD200 expression in some BCLPDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate CD200 expression in different BCLPDs and whether adding CD200 to BCLPD-FCIP routine panels could improve the ability of their differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated CD200 expression in 49 BCLPD patients and 26 age- and sex-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry immunophenotyping first panel included CD5, CD19, sIg, CD23, CD22, CD79b, and FMC7; for BCLPDs other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, CD11c, CD103, CD25, and CD10 were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using tricolor FCIP, CD200 showed high bright expression on CD5/19-positive clone in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B-CLL patients (100%), with a mean of 94% (SD, 11%); in the 2 cases of hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, CD200 was brightly expressed on 96% and 99% of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other BCLPDs including mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, CD200 expression (on CD19/22-positive cells) was less than 20% with a mean of 10% (SD, 8%) and a dim pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD200 expression was significantly higher in CLL compared with non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> groups (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Evaluating CD200 expression has a great impact on accurate BCLPDs diagnosis and could be added to the BCLPD routine panels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The high expression of CD200 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023434" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BCLL">B-cell CLL</z:e> and hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> could open the option for targeted immune (anti-CD200) therapy </plain></SENT>
