<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We have previously characterized apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced in a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, HF-1, after triggering via the B-cell receptor (BCR) or treatment with Ca(2+) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">Ionophore</z:chebi> A23187 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the kinetics of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by these two treatments, as two alternative models of classical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, by flow cytometry using a novel combination of cytofluorometric stains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cells were stained with a combination of Annexin V-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> (PI), and SYTO 17 and analyzed by a two-laser flow cytometry system using 488-nm <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> and 633-nm HeNe air-cooled lasers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both apoptotic models, the first apoptotic cells were detected by SYTO 17 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The alteration in SYTO 17 staining intensity was followed by an increased uptake of PI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, the apoptotic cells were labeled with Annexin V in BCR-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, on treatment with Ca(2+) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">Ionophore</z:chebi> A23187, cells became positive for Annexin V earlier than for PI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The novel cytofluorometric dye, SYTO 17, discriminates apoptotic alterations before Annexin V and PI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PI also discriminates apoptotic alterations before the loss of plasma membrane asymmetry by BCR but not by Ca(2+) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">Ionophore</z:chebi> A23187-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, the combination of these three cytofluorometric dyes allows effective detection of apoptotic subpopulations and ordering of apoptotic events by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
