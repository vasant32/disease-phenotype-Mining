<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed monoclonal antibodies against BTLA and HVEM to study their expression using immunohistochemical and flow cytometric analyses in human tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In reactive lymph nodes, they were both expressed in interfollicular T cells and in B cells from mantle and marginal zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within germinal centers, B cells were negative, whereas T follicular helper (TFH) cells were BTLA+ and follicular dendritic cells were HVEM+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BTLA was strongly expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e>, 19 of 19 positive) when compared with other small B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (0 of 24 positive), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (0 of 10 positive), and marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (0 of 5 positive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that down-regulation of the BTLA-HVEM pathway may be involved in germinal center B-cell activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The specific high expression of BTLA in B-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e> represents a new potential diagnostic tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The BTLA positivity of TFH cells may be a basis for designing future immunotherapies </plain></SENT>
