<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were correlated to histology (Rappaport classification), stage (Ann Arbor classification), the presence of symptoms, and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a group, 38 patients with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> exhibited marked impairment in reactivity to five of six antigens (p less than 0.03 to p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> and reduced levels of serum IgA were found in association with diffuse histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among patients with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, lymphocyte number and skin test reactivity tended to be greater in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e> or without constitutional symptoms, and survival was superior for patients free of symptoms (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a group, 33 patients with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> numbers of lymphocytes, lower levels of serum IgG and IgA, and significant impairment of reactivity to two antigens (streptokinase-streptodornase and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mumps</z:e>; p less than 0.01); reactivity to three other antigens (Candida albicans, coccidiodin, and tuberculin) was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival for patients with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was superior (p less than 0.01) compared to those with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> was found in patients with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (particularly diffuse histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), and definite but much less severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> was characteristic of patients with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
