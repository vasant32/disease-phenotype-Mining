<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A variety of reduced-intensity conditionings (RICs) have been used to reduce TRM, but an optimal conditioning for FL has not been fully established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of allogeneic HSCT for FL with RIC consisting of fludarabine and melphalan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen adult patients with relapsed or refractory FL were conditioned with fludarabine (125 mg/m2) and melphalan (140 mg/m2), and received grafts from an HLA-identical sibling (n = 6) or an unrelated donor (n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the prophylaxis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A or tacrolimus with short-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> was given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> before engraftment, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients achieved engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients died of extensive-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (n = 2) or <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (n = 1) without disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up period of 75.2 months (range: 33.3–111.9 months), 16 patients were alive without disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both the 5-year overall and progression-free survival rates were 84.2% (95% CI: 67.7–100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results strongly suggest that allogeneic HSCT with RIC using fludarabine and melphalan could be a promising treatment choice for refractory or relapsed FL </plain></SENT>
