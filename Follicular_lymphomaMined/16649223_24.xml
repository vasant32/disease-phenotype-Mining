<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The combination of fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and rituximab (FC-R) shows significant in vitro synergism and may improve patient outcome with little overlapping toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between December 2000 and June 2005, 77 patients completed therapy after a median of 4 cycles of FC-R (fludarabine at a dose of 25 mg/m2 intravenously [i.v.] on Days 1-3, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> at a dose of 250 mg/m2 i.v. on Days 1-3, and rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 on Day 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age of the patients was 59 years, 65% were male; 31% had previously untreated disease; and 44% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), 29% had follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 27% other indolent lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to standard disease response criteria, patients underwent evaluation using flow cytometric and/or molecular studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Objective responses (OR) and complete responses (CR) were observed in 83% and 42%, respectively, of evaluable patients (n=76), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For patients with CLL, the respective OR and CR rates were 100% and 67% as firstline therapy, and 95% and 14% as salvage therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the respective OR and CR rates were 100% and 86% as firstline therapy, and 87% and 67% as salvage therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Responders who had no detectable disease on flow cytometric and/or molecular studies experienced prolonged remissions with no recurrences reported at a median 25 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Peripheral stem cell collection using stem cell factor plus granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor was successful in 10 of 13 patients who underwent mobilization (77%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FC-R is highly active as initial or salvage therapy in patients with CLL or indolent non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Collection of autologous stem cells during molecular remission is feasible and may facilitate future exploration of high-dose therapy in these patients </plain></SENT>
