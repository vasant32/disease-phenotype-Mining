<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, hot-spot mutations of Ezh2 were identified in diffused large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate if <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> is dependent on the enzymatic activity of Ezh2, we developed a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor, EI1, which inhibits the enzymatic activity of Ezh2 through direct binding to the enzyme and competing with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32875">methyl group</z:chebi> donor S-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33505">Adenosyl</z:chebi> methionine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EI1-treated cells exhibit genome-wide loss of H3K27 methylation and activation of PRC2 target genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, inhibition of Ezh2 by EI1 in diffused large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> cells carrying the Y641 mutations results in decreased proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results provide strong validation of Ezh2 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
