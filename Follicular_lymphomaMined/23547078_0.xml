<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with relapsed FL who achieved either complete or very good partial remission with salvage chemotherapy were randomly assigned using a factorial design to rituximab purging (P+; 375 mg/m(2) once per week for 4 weeks) or observation (NP) before HDC-ASCT and to maintenance rituximab (M+; 375 mg/m(2) once every 2 months for four infusions) or observation (NM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From October 1999 to April 2006, 280 patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age was 51 years (range, 26 to 70 years), and baseline characteristics were well balanced between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On average, patients were 44 months (range, 3 to 464 months) from diagnosis, with 79% having received two lines and 15% three lines of prior therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 8.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to purging, 10-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 48% for P+ and 42% for NP groups (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.11; P = .18); maintenance had a significant effect on PFS (10-year PFS, 54% for M+ and 37% for NM; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.91; P = .012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (OS) was not improved by either rituximab purging or maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Rituximab maintenance after HDC-ASCT is safe and significantly prolongs PFS but not OS in patients undergoing transplantation for relapsed FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pretransplantation rituximab in vivo purging, even in rituximab-naive patients, failed to improve PFS or OS </plain></SENT>
