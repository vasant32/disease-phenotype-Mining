<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In 2006, we published the results of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> phase III trial EORTC 20981 on the role of rituximab in remission induction and maintenance treatment of relapsed/resistant follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At that time, the median follow-up for the maintenance phase was 33 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Now, we report the long-term outcome of maintenance treatment, with a median follow-up of 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Overall, 465 patients were randomly assigned to induction with either six cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHOP) or rituximab plus CHOP (R-CHOP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those in complete remission or partial remission after induction (n = 334) were randomly assigned to maintenance treatment with rituximab (375 mg/m(2) intravenously once every 3 months) or observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rituximab maintenance significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with observation (median, 3.7 years v 1.3 years; P &lt; .001; hazard ratio [HR], 0.55), both after CHOP induction (P &lt; .001; HR, 0.37) and R-CHOP (P = .003; HR, 0.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall survival (OS) was 74% in the rituximab maintenance arm, and it was 64% in the observation arm (P = .07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After progression, a rituximab-containing salvage therapy was given to 59% of patients treated with CHOP followed by observation, compared with 26% after R-CHOP followed by rituximab maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rituximab maintenance was associated with a significant increase in grades 3 to 4 infections: 9.7% v 2.4% (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: With long-term follow-up, we confirm the superior PFS with rituximab maintenance in relapsed/resistant FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The improvement of OS did not reach statistical significance, possibly because of the unbalanced use of rituximab in post-protocol salvage treatment </plain></SENT>
