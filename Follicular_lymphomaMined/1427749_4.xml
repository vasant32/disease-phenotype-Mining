<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reciprocal chromosomal translocation t(14;18), leading to overexpression of this oncogene, can be found in the majority of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and much less frequently in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied the expression of this protein in different subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> using monoclonal antibodies directed against a formalin-resistant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> of the bcl-2 protein and also have investigated these cases by polymerase chain reaction for evidence of the t(14;18) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We were particularly interested to determine whether nodular paragranuloma (lymphocyte-predominant, nodular), which differs from other subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> by virtue of the B-cell nature of its malignant cell population, is characterized by expression of the bcl-2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that only a small number of nodular paragranulomas express the bcl-2 protein and that the expression is not specific for this type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a smaller number of cases this expression of bcl-2 could be explained by the presence of the translocation t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
