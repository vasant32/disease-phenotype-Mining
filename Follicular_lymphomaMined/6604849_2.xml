<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Selected B and T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were also tested for reactivity with the monoclonal antibodies OKT 3, OKT 4, OKT 6, OKT 8, OKT 11A, Leu-1, Leu-2a, Leu-3a, Leu-4 and Leu-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 26 B and 6 T <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30214">mu+</z:chebi> (81%), kappa+ (77%) and 31% were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30214">mu+</z:chebi> delta+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of the T <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> arose in a patient with antecedent follicular small-cleaved (B) cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most accurate marker for characterizing the immunologic phenotype in NHL was the clonal excess of kappa+ or lambda+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither Estandard, EAET, Egravity or T-LCL were consistently reliable as sole reagents in identifying T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, their individual scores often being lower than those of monoclonal pan-T cell reagents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HLA-D (Ia-like) antigen was noted in 89% of B and 50% of T <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The corresponding values for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">c-ALL</z:e> antigen were 12 and 33%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The comparative scores in T-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> between OKT 4 and Leu-3a for "helper-inducer" (HE) cells and OKT 8 and Leu-2a for "suppressor-cytotoxic" (SU) cells were not uniformly consistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four T <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had a mixed HE/SU <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp>, one was HE, and another SU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anti-T reactivity was detected in the neoplastic follicles of six of seven follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The percentage of anti-T reactive cells within positive neoplastic follicles was usually small (5-15%) and of the same order as that noted within reactive lymphoid follicles (5-30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>High numbers (50-100%) of cells from five small lymphocytic B, three diffuse small cleaved cell B and six T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were also positive with one or more anti-T reagents, suggesting the presence of cross-reactive antigens that make phenotyping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with monoclonal antibodies problematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Reactivity with the monoclonal antibody Leu-7 (HNK-1), a putative NK-specific reagent, was seen in one of five B and three of five T <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
