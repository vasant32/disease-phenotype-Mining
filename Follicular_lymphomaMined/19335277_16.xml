<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Lymphoproliferative and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> share monoclonal dysregulation and survival advantage of B-lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, therapies directed towards eliminating B-cells will play an important role as CD20 is exclusively expressed in B-lymphocytes and its modulation by monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab has improved outcomes in lymphoproliferative and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ofatumumab is a new, fully human anti-CD20 antibody and has been shown to be effective and safe, but its role in these conditions is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To describe the preclinical and clinical data available on ofatumumab for the treatment of lymphoproliferative and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An extensive search of published articles and abstracts on preclinical and clinical studies with ofatumumab was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ofatumumab is a second-generation anti-CD20 antibody that has been demonstrated to be safe and efficacious in patients with lymphoproliferative and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ofatumumab is fully human, attaches to a newly identified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> and shows lower off-rates and improved complement-dependent cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Initial data present ofatumumab as an attractive agent with lower rates of infusion-related events than rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ongoing Phase III trials in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> are ongoing, and Phase II trials in patients with aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> are also under development </plain></SENT>
