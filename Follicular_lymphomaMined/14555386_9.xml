<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This technique mainly targets the well-characterised breakpoint regions in chromosomes 14 and 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FISH is now applicable on paraffin tissue sections and has been suggested to be capable of detecting essentially 100% of t(14;18) translocated cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we described the application of both PCR and FISH for the detection of t(14;18) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases were retrieved from the files of the Department of Pathology, University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nested PCR amplification of MBR/JH and mcr/JH was performed in these cases, and those cases that did not demonstrate the translocation were subjected to FISH analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty cases (60%) had t(14;18) translocation detected by PCR, 25 (50%) had breakpoint with MBR and five (10%) involved mcr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty cases without detectable t(14;18) translocation by PCR were analysed by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eleven cases were successfully probed, and four of them showed positive translocation signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination of PCR and FISH analysis on paraffin tissue sections for the detection of t(14;18) translocation increases the sensitivity of detection from 60 to 68% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Problems encountered in our FISH analysis on tissue sections impose certain limitations in using this technique for retrospective screening of large number of samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we suggested the application of PCR as the first screening tool on retrospective archival materials, followed by FISH on those PCR-negative cases </plain></SENT>
