<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined stimuli which are required for the induction of in vitro proliferation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, a low grade non-Hodgkin's B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> characterized by a specific chromosomal translocation, t(14;18)(q32;q21), and by in vivo growth of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in germinal center-like follicles infiltrated with CD4+ T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purified follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, which are morphologically uniform, small, and dense, did not respond to stimulation with soluble lymphokines in the absence of T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vigorous in vitro proliferation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells was induced, however, when the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were cultured with a CD4+ T cell clone which recognized alloantigens expressed by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This response required B-T cell contact, and was inhibited by anti-class II but not by anti-class I MHC mAb, indicating that these neoplastic B cells behaved as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells and responded to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> activation and differentiation signals from T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the cognate B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-T cell interaction occurred in culture, addition of IL-2 or IL-4 enhanced the proliferation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results, with a monoclonal and homogeneous population of B cells, affirm the idea that cognate interaction between B cells and Th cells is required for the effective activation of resting B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these results suggest that a critical host-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> interaction occurs in vivo, and that the polyclonal CD4+ T cells that infiltrate follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> play a role in sustaining rather than inhibiting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If so, therapies directed not only against the neoplastic cell but also against specific T cells and their cognate interactions with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells may have a rationale </plain></SENT>
