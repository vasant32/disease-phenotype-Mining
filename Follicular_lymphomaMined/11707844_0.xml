<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to examine the effect of this rituximab schedule on circulating FL cells in an ongoing multicenter study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred fifty-four patients with FL were examined by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at baseline for the presence of t(14;18) translocation-carrying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in bone marrow and/or blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four patients (42%) had PCR-detectable t(14;18)(+) FL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment characteristics of these 64 patients were as follows: one had stage I, nine had stage II, 14 had stage III, and 40 had stage IV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients had bulky disease (&gt; or = 5 cm) and 25 patients had an elevated serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow was morphologically assessed in 64 patients, and 39 of these patients had an infiltration with FL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood samples from 51 patients were available for PCR analysis between weeks 8-12 after induction therapy, and 28 of these patients (55%) were PCR negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Paired blood and bone marrow samples were available for PCR analysis from 39 patients between weeks 8-12 after induction therapy with rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of these patients (33%) did not have PCR-detectable cells in blood and bone marrow, while 26 patients (67%) still had circulating t(14;18)(+) cells in either bone marrow (eight patients), blood (one patient), or both (17 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PCR negativity in blood and bone marrow in 13 patients was statistically significantly associated with partial or complete response after induction therapy with rituximab (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, clearance of PCR-detectable t(14;18)(+) cells in bone marrow and/or blood could not be associated with any low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden pretreatment characteristics such as stages I/II, absence of morphological bone marrow infiltration or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> bulk of &gt; or = 5 cm, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum LDH </plain></SENT>
