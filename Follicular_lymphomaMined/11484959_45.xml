<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although PET has been shown to be highly sensitive in the primary staging of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, previous studies with small numbers of patients indicated that low-grade NHL may not always be adequately detected by PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We undertook this study to determine factors influencing the detection of lesions by PET in low-grade NHL and to evaluate the utility of PET in this indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients underwent conventional staging procedures (clinical examination, oto-rhino-laryngologic examination, computed tomography of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, gastroscopy and bone marrow biopsy as well as whole-body non-attenuation corrected <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG-PET RESULTS: PET detected 40% more abnormal lymph node areas than conventional staging in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but was inappropriate for the staging of small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> where it detected less than 58% of abnormal lymph node areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PET showed more lesions than conventional staging for peripheral (34% more lymph node areas detected) and thoracic lymph node (39% more) areas but not for abdominal or pelvic lymph nodes (26% fewer areas detected) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity to detect bone marrow infiltration was unacceptably low for PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, PET was as effective as standard procedures for the detection of other extranodal localizations, although a few localizations were detected only by PET and a few others only by conventional procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PET may contribute to the management of patients with low-grade follicular NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the other low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes, the role of PET is less evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies using PET to evaluate the results of treatment or to diagnose disease recurrence are warranted in low-grade follicular NHL </plain></SENT>
