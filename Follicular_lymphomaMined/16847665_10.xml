<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the rarity, the natural history and the optimal treatment modality have not been well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we performed a retrospective analysis of the clinical features and treatment outcomes of NMZL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients who were histologically diagnosed as NMZL were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three percent of the patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e> (stages I and II), and 21.2% (7/33) had bone marrow involvement at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>B symptom was present in only three patients (8.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most patients were categorized as low or low-intermediate risk group by international prognostic index (IPI) (77.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Majority (94.4%) of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e> achieved complete remission (CR) after the initial treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the seven patients with disseminated disease, who were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy, four patients achieved CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the seven patients who received nonanthracycline-based chemotherapy, no patient achieved CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After the median follow-up duration of 36 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.9 (95% CI; 2.9-5.6) years, and the estimated 5-year PFS and overall survival rates were 47.2 and 82.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The significant predictive factors for PFS were performance status, advanced stage, and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> IPI (FLIPI) in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This clinical feature is similar to FL rather than to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>-MALT type </plain></SENT>
