<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Addition of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab to chemotherapy (R-chemo) has been shown to improve response rates and progression-free survival in patients with indolent or mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the impact of R-chemo on overall survival is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the efficacy of combined immunochemotherapy using R-chemo compared with the identical chemotherapy alone with respect to overall survival in patients with advanced indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical databases and conference proceedings were searched for randomized controlled trials published from January 1990 through December 2005 that compared R-chemo with chemotherapy alone in patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We included full-text and abstract publications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endpoints were overall survival, disease control, overall response, and toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A fixed-effects model was assumed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> meta-analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For binary data, the relative risk was used as an indicator of treatment effect, and the Mantel-Haenszel method was used to pool relative risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Statistical tests for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> were one-sided; statistical tests for effect estimates were two-sided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven randomized controlled trials involving 1943 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, or other indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were included in the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five studies were published as full-text articles, and two were in abstract form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with R-chemo had better overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] for mortality = 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.54 to 0.78), overall response (relative risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.16 to 1.27), and disease control (HR of disease event = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.55 to 0.71) than patients treated with chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>R-chemo improved overall survival in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (HR for mortality = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.51 to 0.79) and in patients with mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (HR for mortality = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.37 to 0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, in the latter case, there was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> among the trials (P = .07), making the survival benefit less reliable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with indolent or mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, R-chemo is superior to chemotherapy alone with respect to overall survival </plain></SENT>
