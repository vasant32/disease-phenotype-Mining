<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study comprised 214 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Grade I/II was considered separately from grade III FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data were analyzed with respect to three age groups: &lt;60, 60-69 and &gt;or=70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall survival rate decreased in the older age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Grade III patients showed a statistically significant decrease in overall survival in comparison with grade I/II patients (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cause-specific survival analysis showed that in the older age groups, there was an increasing influence of concomitant disease on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate, especially among grade III FL patients &gt;70 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The survival curve in grade III FL patients was shown to reach a plateau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prognostic scoring system, according to the Italian <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Intergroup, fitted better to grade I/II patients, while the International Prognostic Index showed better discrimination amongst grade III patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Separate grading for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An age &gt;70 years has a negative impact on outcome, but the contribution of concomitant disease herein is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Different prognostic scoring systems should be applied to the different grades of FL </plain></SENT>
