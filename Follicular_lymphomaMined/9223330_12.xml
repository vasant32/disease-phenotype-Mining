<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In most human follicular B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> the bcl-2 gene is up-regulated as a result of the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation generating a hybrid bcl-2-IgH <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we have identified in t(14;18)-positive cells a bcl-2-IgH <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the antisense orientation, putatively responsible for the overexpression of bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein we show that this chimeric antisense transcript is an optimal target for synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A variety of sense-oriented oligonucleotides have been designed that target the antisense transcript in regions endowed with a sequence specificity presumably restricted to an individual cell line (the bcl-2-IgH fusion regions) or extended to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> t(14;18) cells (the ectopic bcl-2 segment upstream from the major breakpoint region and the IgH segment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> sense-oriented ODNs complementary to the antisense transcript induced an early strong inhibition of cell growth and a late fulminant cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As expected, the activity of ODNs targeting the fusion region was restricted to each individual cell line, whereas the activity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ODNs targeting the common bcl-2 and IgH segments was extended to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> t(14;18) cell lines tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These sense ODNs were not effective in untranslocated cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antisense-oriented ODNs, complementary to the bcl-2-IgH <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, and control ODNs (scrambled, inverted, or mismatched) were biologically ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The selectivity and efficacy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sense ODNs tested provide support for the development of therapeutic ODNs targeting the bcl-2-IgH antisense transcript expressed in human follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
