<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the nucleotide sequence of only one t(14;18)-positive MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has been reported so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We here report the molecular characterization of the IGH-MALT1 fusion products in 5 new cases of t(14;18)-positive MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar to the IGH-associated translocations in follicular and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the IGH-MALT1 junctions in MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> features of a recombination signal sequence-guided V(D)J-mediated translocation at the IGH locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, analogous to follicular and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, templated <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> (T-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi>) were identified at the t(14;18)/IGH-MALT1 breakpoint junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On chromosome 18, we identified a novel major breakpoint region in MALT1 upstream of its coding region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the presence of duplications of MALT1 <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> in one case suggests an underlying staggered DNA-break process not consistent with V(D)J-mediated recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The molecular characteristics of the t(14;18)/IGH-MALT1 resemble those found in the t(14;18)/IGH-BCL2 in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and t(11;14)/CCND1-IGH in mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, suggesting that these translocations could be generated by common pathomechanisms involving illegitimate V(D)J-mediated recombination on IGH as well as new synthesis of T-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or alternative NHEJ repair pathways on the IGH-translocation partner </plain></SENT>
