<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze the efficacy and toxicity of a fludarabine combination as first-line treatment in patients with advanced-stage disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a phase II trial including 120 patients (&lt; or =65 years) treated with 6 cycles of fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> (FCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Molecular response was assessed by q-PCR in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 119 patients with an assessable response, complete response was achieved in 99 (83%) partial response in 13 (11%) and 7 (6%) did not respond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After treatment, 37 out of 46 (81%) patients achieved molecular response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 3.9 years, 32 patients have relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-year progression-free survival was 58% (95% confidence interval: 47-69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Variables associated with a shorter progression-free survival were a poor performance status (ECOG&gt; or =2), &gt; or =2 extranodal sites and high beta2-microglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixteen episodes of grade 3-4 infections were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients died during therapy (of progressive multifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> and bronchoaspiration respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No late toxicity has been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients died during follow-up (9 after relapse, 2 during chemotherapy, 1 in complete remission after surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The overall survival at 5 years was 89% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>ECOG &gt; or =2 and high beta2-microglobulin were associated with a shorter survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FCM results in high complete and molecular response rates, with prolonged response duration in younger patients with advanced-stage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The combination of FCM with rituximab as front-line treatment warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
