<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Differences in prevalence rates among reported studies could be a result of geographic variability or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the molecular approaches that have been employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato DNA in diagnostic tissue samples from fresh cutaneous biopsies of 98 primary cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 19 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three different polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols targeting the hbb, flagellin, and Osp-A genes were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing of both sense and antisense strands of purified PCR products confirmed the specificity of the amplified fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sequence specificity was assessed using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, and MultAlin software was used to investigate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of target gene sequences across the different samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Borrelia DNA was not detected in 19 controls, 23 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 31 cases of extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, or 30 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mycosis fungoides</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A single case of 14 diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases was positive for B. burgdorferi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study does not support a pathogenic role of B. burgdorferi in primary cutaneous B- and T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> from areas nonendemic for this microorganism and the consequent rationale for the adoption of antibiotic therapy in these patients </plain></SENT>
