<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 and Bcl-6 are two markers linked to germinal center B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both markers are thought to have an effect on prognosis of mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> were included; Bcl-2 and Bcl-6 expression by immunohistochemistry was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 protein was positive in 36.4% (16 of 44) of cases (62.5% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 16.7% of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 30% of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>); the positive group implying a bad prognostic effect of the marker in NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bcl-6 was positive in 13.6% (6 of 44) of cases (11.1% of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 40% of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) and its positivity implies a better disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 and Bcl-6 can be used as prognostic marker in NHL </plain></SENT>
