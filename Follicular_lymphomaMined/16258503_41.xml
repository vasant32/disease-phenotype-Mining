<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases assessed by conventional cytogenetics had a complex karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 10 men and four women, with a median age of 55 years (range, 29-72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of these patients had a history of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The biopsy specimens were obtained from bone marrow, lymph node, and extranodal sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Morphologically, nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> had features of Burkitt or atypical Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and three were diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with high-grade cytologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining two cases were plasmablastic <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> and low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases expressed BCL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proliferation index assessed by using Ki-67 (MIB1) was 5% in the low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 80% in the plasmablastic <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp>, 90-95% in three cases of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and ranged from 90 to &gt;99% in most Burkitt and atypical Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patient with low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was treated with rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other patients received intensive combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two of these patients underwent bone marrow transplantation, and one patient received radiation therapy in addition to transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up period was 9 months (range, 3-81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 10 patients died with a median survival of 9 months (range, 3-81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We conclude that most B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with concurrent t(14;18) and 8q24/c-MYC translocations fall within the morphologic spectrum of diffuse large B-cell and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> are high-grade and are associated with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, this combination of molecular abnormalities can also rarely occur in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, such as the cases of low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and plasmablastic <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> in this study </plain></SENT>
