<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Exosomes are small membrane vesicles secreted by several cell types during exocytic fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exosomes from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells can transfer antigens from cell to cell, a property favouring antigen-specific immune responses in vitro and in vivo, and are thus an interesting putative therapeutic tool in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exosomes have been well studied in EBV (Epstein-Barr virus)-transformed human B-cell lines; however, biological stimuli regulating exosome secretion quantitatively and/or qualitatively still remain poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We analysed the effect of the BCR stimulation on exosome release in the human follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B-cell line DOHH2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that BCR (B-cell receptor) triggering of DOHH2 cells induced the polarization of CD63(+) MHC class II compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, BCR stimulation increased the release of exosome-associated proteins in the extracellular space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we found that the BCR was expressed at the surface of exosomes, and could target a bound anti-human IgG to these vesicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BCR can modulate the protein content of exosomes upon stimulation, and can target its bound antigen to these vesicles </plain></SENT>
