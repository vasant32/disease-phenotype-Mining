<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the antitumor activity of the novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> in patients with indolent non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024419" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia</z:e> were eligible for study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">Bortezomib</z:chebi> was given at a dose of 1.5 mg/m(2) as an i.v. push on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eligibility included the following: (a) no more than three prior therapies, (b) at least 1 month since prior chemotherapy, (c) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1513041" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measurable disease</z:e>, and (d) an absolute neutrophil count of &gt;1,000/microL and a platelet count &gt;50,000/microL for the first dose of any cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were registered, of which 69 were assessable for response based on the completion of two cycles of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subtypes included FL (59.5%), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (52%), small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (16.2%), marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (21.6%), and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024419" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median number of prior therapies was three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common grade 3 toxicity was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> (35%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients experienced grade &lt;or=2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>sensory neuropathy</z:hpo> (32), and 8% experienced grade 3 neurosensory toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 45% (40% on an intention to treat) including 10 complete remissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 18 patients with FL, 9 responded with 4 complete response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median time to treatment response for FL was 12 weeks, whereas the median time to treatment response for other subtypes of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was only 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> has significant single agent activity in patients with FL, and that longer durations of treatment may improve overall response </plain></SENT>
