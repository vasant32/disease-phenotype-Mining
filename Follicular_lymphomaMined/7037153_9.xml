<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients with Stage III and IV nodular histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NH), entered on three different Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group protocols from 1972-78, were analyzed for response and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A complete response (CR) rate of 44% was observed, with 40% partial responders (PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four of the 11 CRs are continuing in their original remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median survival for CRs was 52 months; for PRs it was 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The six patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> had a median survival of 18 months versus 51 months for the 19 patients treated with more aggressive combination chemotherapy programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in survival was noted between those patients with both nodular and diffuse histology and those with a pure nodular pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median survival of the 25 NH patients was 47 months and is similar to a group of 101 patients with nodular mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NM) entered on the same ECOG protocols during this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This survival is intermediate between the nodular lymphocytic poorly differentiated subtype and diffuse histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It suggests that patients with NH histologies be treated with aggressive combination chemotherapy programs designed to achieve complete remission and prolonged disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
