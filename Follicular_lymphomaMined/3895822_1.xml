<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cells reacting with this antibody (HNK-1+ cells) were studied on tissue sections of ninety two cases of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (MLs) by using immunoperoxidase technique, in an attempt to elucidate the role of this type of cells in MLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were found to be highly infiltrated with HNK-1+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mode of infiltration in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is just like in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> germinal centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Many cases of diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with cleaved nuclei, indicative of diffuse B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of follicular center cell origin, as well as diffuse ML with heavy <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> (<z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>) or histiocytic reaction, were also found to be infiltrated with abundant HNK-1+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, other types of B-cell ML and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of T-cell ML, as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, were shown to be very poor in HNK-1+ cell reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From a prognostic viewpoint, the low grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> group in the NCI Working Formulation or Kiel Classification was found to be infiltrated with significantly much more HNK-1+ cells as compared to the high grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The significance of these findings are discussed, with the stress on the possible suppressive function of HNK-1+ cells on proliferation and differentiation of follicular center cell type B-cell MLs </plain></SENT>
