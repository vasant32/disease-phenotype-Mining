<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic studies of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) have revealed a nonrandom translocation, t(14;18)(q32;q21), to be strongly correlated with follicular histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our recent study of 149 cases of NHL, 68 cases had a t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-four of these were follicular and 24 diffuse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the majority of cases (90%) there were additional chromosome abnormalities, which were analyzed to determine whether any were specifically associated with diffuse histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chromosome 11 abnormalities occurring together with the t(14;18) were found to be present in 17/68 cases; 14/17 (82%) were diffuse and 3/17 (18%) were follicular NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, 14/24 (58%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with t(14;18) had an abnormality of chromosome 11 compared to only 3/44 (7%) of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, suggesting that the addition of an abnormality of chromosome 11 to a t(14;18) karyotype is associated with diffuse histology </plain></SENT>
