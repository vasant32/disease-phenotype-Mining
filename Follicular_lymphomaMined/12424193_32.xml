<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL3) is thought to have an aggressive clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the basis of possible biologic differences, the new World Health Organization (WHO) classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> suggests further subdivision of FL3 into grades 3a and 3b and states that the percentage of involvement by diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) should also be reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical implications of these features are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we studied 190 newly diagnosed patients with lymph node-based FL3 who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-containing combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The follicular component was subclassified as grade 3a (FL3a) or grade 3b (FL3b) according to the WHO criteria, or as follicular large cleaved cell type (FLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of a diffuse component, if present, was also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 190 cases, there were 107 FL3a (56%), 53 FL3b (28%), and 30 FLC (16%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diffuse areas were seen in 72 cases (31 FL3a, 28 FL3b, and 13 FLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the clinical characteristics, overall survival, or event-free survival between patients with grades FL3a, FL3b, or FLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, those cases with a predominant diffuse component (&gt; 50% diffuse) had a significantly worse overall survival (P =.0037) and event-free survival (P =.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we conclude that the subdivision of FL3 into cytologic subtypes does not appear to be important clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, patients with FL3 having a diffuse component of more than 50% have an inferior survival that is similar to the survival of those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
