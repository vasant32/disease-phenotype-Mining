<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Within each stratum, patients were prospectively and randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CP) or fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Morbidity from both regimens was negligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete response (CR) was defined as the resolution of organ enlargement and the return of blood count to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CR rate for the entire CP group (n = 54) was 59% and that for the TBI group (n = 54), 52%; median survivals were 53 and 57 months respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 41 patients with CLL the CR rate for CP (n = 17) was 47% and that for TBI (n = 24), 50%; the median survival for CP was 48 months, and for TBI it was 51 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the 21 patients with WDLL the CR rate for CP (n = 15) was 53% and that for TBI (n = 6), 67%; the median survival for CP was 42 months and has not yet been reached for TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the 46 patients with FL the CR rate for CP (n = 22) was 72% and that for TBI (n = 24), 50%; the median survival was 55 months, and for TBI it was 56 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the differences in CR or survival are statistically significant (P greater than .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In these indolent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative diseases</z:e>, CP and TBI are equally effective forms of initial treatment irrespective of the end point being defined as CR or survival </plain></SENT>
