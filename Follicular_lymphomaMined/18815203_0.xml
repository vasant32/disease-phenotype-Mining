<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors report histomorphologic, immunophenotypic, and genotypic findings of 2 cases of B-cell CLH demonstrating progressive transformation of germinal center (PTGC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histologically, most of the lymphoid follicles were PTGCs with a few hyperplastic germinal centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PTGC was characterized by enlarged but well-circumscribed follicles without clear demarcation of the germinal center and mantle zone, which contained a predominance of small lymphocytes and variable numbers of centrocytes, centroblasts, and immunoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there were no centroblasts and immunoblasts resembling lymphocytic and/or histiocytic Reed-Sternberg cell variants in nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NLPHL</z:e>) in either lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These unusual CLHs should be differentiated from the primary cutaneous marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, primary cutaneous follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, particularly "floral variant," or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NLPHL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment, immunophenotypic and genotypic studies are required along with careful morphologic examination </plain></SENT>
