<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies of the relationship between cigarette smoking and non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) have yielded conflicting results, perhaps because most studies have evaluated the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL subtypes combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data from a population-based case-control study conducted among women in Connecticut were used to evaluate the impact of cigarette smoking on the risk of NHL by histologic type, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> grade, and immunologic type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 601 histologically confirmed, incident cases of NHL and 718 population-based controls provided in-person interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A standardised, structured questionnaire was used to collect information on each subject's current smoking status, age at initiation, duration and intensity of smoking, and cumulative lifetime exposure to smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that cigarette smoking does not alter the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL subtypes combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, increased risk of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> appears to be associated with increased intensity and duration of smoking, and cumulative lifetime exposure to smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with nonsmokers, women with a cumulative lifetime exposure of 16-33 pack-years and 34 pack-years or greater experience 50% increased risk (OR=1.5, 95% CI 0.9-2.5) and 80% increased risk (OR=1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.2), respectively, of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (P for linear trend=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study findings are consistent with several previous epidemiologic studies suggesting that cigarette smoking increases the risk of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This research highlights the importance of distinguishing between NHL subtypes in future research on the aetiology of NHL </plain></SENT>
