<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-four cases of these were also investigated for surface markers with immunological techniques, and results of histochemical, routine histological and immunological observations were correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one of 27 B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed prominent ATPase activity, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 13 T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, except one case, did not show such activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, though of B-cell nature, were often negative for ATPase and it remained negative after diffuse evolution in some </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four of 7 A1Pase positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were of B-cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dot-like localized AcPase and beta-glucuronidase activity characterized T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> while 5 T-cell <z:chebi fb="6" ids="53413">PDL</z:chebi>, including lymphoblastic type with double markers, showed localized esterase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enzyme histochemical characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were fairly honest reflection of those of various functional units in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Enzyme histochemical methods appeared to be a useful tool for the study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
