<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The karyotypic abnormality t(14;18)(q32;q21) is reported to occur in 75% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This translocation results in the rearrangement of a putative oncogene bcl-2, which resides at chromosome 18 band q21 (the 18q21 gene) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using two human genomic DNA fragments cloned from the chromosome 18 band q21 as probes, we analyzed 65 uncultured human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples by the Southern blot technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 18q21 gene was rearranged in 18 of 26 (69%) follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 3 of 5 (60%) follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> transformed to large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 8 of 20 (40%) diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DLCLs), and 2 of 7 (29%) small noncleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (SNCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our analysis detected rearrangement of the 18q21 gene in 10 of 13 (77%) cases in which the t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation was found by cytogenetic techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our analysis also proved helpful in difficult karyotyping situations: (a) identifying the donor chromosome fragment as chromosome 18 band q21 in 4 of 9 (44%) cases that cytogenetically displayed a 14q+ chromosome of unknown origin, and (b) identifying a rearrangement of chromosome 18 band q21 in 12 of 18 (67%) cases that cytogenetically yielded no cells in metaphase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated three cases of submicroscopic rearrangement of the 18q21 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In our studies, patients with DLCLs and rearrangement of the 18q21 gene had a significantly higher incidence of extranodal involvement when compared with patients with DLCLs and no 18q21 gene rearrangement (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
