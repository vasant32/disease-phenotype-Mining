<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis of 1,792 solid tissues suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, submitted over a 12-year period, was carried out and flow cytometry (FC) results were compared with histologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The final histologic diagnosis of cases documented in this report is as follows: 1,270 non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL); 17 composite <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; four NHL plus <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>; five post-transplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo>; 105 Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>); eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo>; 42 tissue <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>; and 341 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A strong correlation between <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and FC data was observed among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> (1,268/1,304, 97.2%) with the exception of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among B-NHL, FC detection of clonally restricted B-cell allowed the identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that were not histologically clear and the differential diagnosis between follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and reactive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A high correlation level (r = 0.83; P &lt; 0.0001) was obtained in comparing proliferation results obtained by FC and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among T-NHL, FC detection of an aberrant phenotype direct histologic diagnosis in cases having less than 20% of neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In nine cases, FC suggested the need to evaluate a neoplastic population, not morphologically evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results show that FC routinely performed on tissue samples suspected of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is a fundamental adjunct to <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in the diagnosis of NHL and may enhance the performance of the histologic evaluation so as to achieve the final diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature of a wide series of tissues also studied by FC </plain></SENT>
