<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The BMI-1 gene is a putative oncogene belonging to the Polycomb group family that cooperates with c-myc in the generation of mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and seems to participate in cell cycle regulation and senescence by acting as a transcriptional repressor of the INK4a/ARF locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The BMI-1 gene has been located on chromosome 10p13, a region involved in chromosomal translocations in infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, and amplified in occasional non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHLs) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the possible alterations of this gene in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, we have examined 160 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, 13 myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, and 89 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> by Southern blot analysis and detected BMI-1 gene amplification (3- to 7-fold) in 4 of 36 (11%) mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCLs</z:e>) with no alterations in the INK4a/ARF locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BMI-1 and p16INK4a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression were also studied by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot, respectively, in a subset of NHLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BMI-1 expression was significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> than in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with gene amplification showed significantly higher <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels than other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCLs</z:e> and NHLs with the BMI-1 gene in germline configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCLs</z:e> also showed very high <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels without gene amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A good correlation between BMI-1 mRNA levels and protein expression was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No relationship was detected between BMI-1 and p16INK4a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that BMI-1 gene alterations in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> are uncommon, but they may contribute to the pathogenesis in a subset of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, particularly of mantle cell type </plain></SENT>
