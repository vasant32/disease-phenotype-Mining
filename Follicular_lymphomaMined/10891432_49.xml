<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic patients with preserved end organ function received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 600 mg/m(2) intravenous (iv) day 1 and fludarabine 20 mg/m(2) iv days1 through 5, followed by filgrastim 5 microg/kg subcutaneous starting approximately day 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment was repeated every 28 days until maximum response or a maximum of 6 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty patients, median age 53.5 years, were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients with non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) were stage IV and 6 were stage III </plain></SENT>
