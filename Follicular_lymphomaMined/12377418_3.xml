<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Also, there is evidence that the distribution of NHL subtypes differs by geographic region; however, there are no data for Ecuador </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using polymerase chain reaction, we examined the frequency of t(14;18) (MBR and mcr rearrangements) in 65 NHL samples collected through 5 years from the principal hospitals of Quito, Ecuador </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 65 NHL, only 5 were FL, which represents an incidence of 7.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This incidence is lower than observed in North America (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we did not find the t(14;18) in the samples analyzed, absence of which was confirmed by the use of a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that this translocation is rare in NHL in Ecuador </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings confirm that there are differences in the incidence of specific subtypes of NHL across some geographic areas and suggest that genetic factors may be responsible for the observed differences </plain></SENT>
