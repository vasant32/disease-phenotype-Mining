<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This report summarizes a cumulative 4-year experience in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of immunoglobin heavy chain (IgH) and TcR-gamma chain gene rearrangements in 525 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the sensitivity of the PCR methodology was found to be tissue dependent, in the study of the presence of clonal cell population in tissues containing a small number of polyclonal lymphocytes, such as skin and gastrointestinal biopsy specimens, we used the multiple-PCR run approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this latter methodology, we repeat the PCR reaction from the same sample at least three times to confirm the reproducibility of the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the study of 273 cases of B- or T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with characteristic immunomorphological and clinical features, a clonal IgH or TcR-gamma chain gene rearrangement was detected in approximately 80% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A clonal rearrangement involving both IgH and TcR-gamma chain genes was found in 10% of cases of both B-cell and T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study of 167 cases of nonneoplastic lymphoid tissue samples showed the presence of clonally rearranged cell populations for IgH or TcR-gamma genes in 3 and 9% of cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also applied PCR for the study of 85 cases of lymphoproliferations with no definite diagnosis (i.e., benign versus malignant) after immunomorphological analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 65 cases (76%), the correlation of immunomorphological features with the presence (48 cases) or the absence (17 cases) of clonal lymphoid cell populations led to a definite diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these cases, the final diagnosis was found to be in agreement with the clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the 20 remaining cases (24%), no definite diagnosis could be made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also assessed the value of PCR in detecting bcl-2/J(H) gene rearrangement as an additional clonal marker in the diagnosis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2/J(H) rearrangement and/or IgH gene rearrangement was found in approximately 85% (71/85) of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases studied </plain></SENT>
