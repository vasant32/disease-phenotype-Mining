<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred and seventy seven consecutive lymph node FNA specimens reported to be consistent with reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> (n = 213) or suggestive/diagnostic of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 64) were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow up data were obtained by case record review or by histological correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The value of immunocytochemistry, in situ hybridisation for immunoglobulin light chain <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) towards the final clinicopathological diagnosis was assessed in 92, 61, and 45 cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty one of 67 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 207 of 209 reactive lymph nodes were accurately diagnosed by FNA cytology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were six false negative aspirates including three cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, two cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two FNA specimens considered suspicious of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> proved reactive on histology or clinical follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One metastatic small cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was wrongly diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ancillary studies contributed to the correct diagnosis in most cases although occasional misleading results were obtained, particularly with PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FNA cytology accurately distinguished reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> from malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 97% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, occasional wrong diagnoses occurred owing to sampling error or misinterpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ancillary studies can be applied to cytological samples and contribute to the diagnosis in most cases </plain></SENT>
