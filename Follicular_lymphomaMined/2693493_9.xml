<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mean nuclear counts were greater in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> (3.71 v 3.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This difference was significant but counts overlapped so much that they were of no practical value in distinguishing between both conditions </plain></SENT>
