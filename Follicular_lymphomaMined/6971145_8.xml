<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As of March 1978, the prognosis was confirmed in 715 non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases reported during the 12-year period from 1965 through 1976 in the Prefecture of Kagoshima </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Included were 222 cases of extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with the initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site in the gastrointestinal tract and Waldeyer's ring had a relatively good probability of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the patients with cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, those with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mycosis fungoides</z:e> type had a poor survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Kagoshima Prefecture, the survival curve for cases of nodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is characteristically much poorer than those reported in the medical literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the nodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the nodular type was found in 128 cases and the five-year survival rate was 15%, while the diffuse type accounted for 365 cases and the five-year survival rate was 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The paracortex type, considered to be of T-cell origin, accounted for 55 cases and the five-year survival rate was 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These differences were statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on our data, the classification of nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> into subtypes according to the degree of nodularity was found to be useful since it was related to clinical stage and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rappaport's cellular classification of diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is related to prognosis and was found to be useful, but problems still remain in determining T- and B-cell types by means of cellular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and thus further study is warranted </plain></SENT>
