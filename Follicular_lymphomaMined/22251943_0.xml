<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Primary bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (PBML) is a rare entity whose real boundaries and clinicobiological significance are not well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Criteria to diagnose PBML encompass isolated bone marrow infiltration, with no evidence of nodal or extranodal involvement, including the bone, and the exclusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that are considered to primarily involve the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one out of 40 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> retrospectively reviewed by the International Extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Study Group from 12 institutions in 7 different countries over a 25-year period fulfilled the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cases comprised 4 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs), 15 diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e>), and 2 peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, not otherwise specified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The FL cases showed paratrabecular infiltration, BCL2 protein and CD10 expression, and BCL2 gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> showed nodular infiltration in 6 cases and was diffuse in 9 cases; it also showed positivity for BCL2 protein (9/10) and IRF4 (6/8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median age was 65 years with male predominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but 3 FL patients were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most cases presented with cytopenias and high <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients (3 FL cases and 1 DLBCL case) had leukemic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> patients received CHOP-like or R-CHOP-like regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The outcome was unfavorable, with a median overall survival of 1.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, PBML is a very uncommon <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with particular clinical features and heterogenous histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Its recognition is important to establish accurate diagnosis and adequate therapy </plain></SENT>
