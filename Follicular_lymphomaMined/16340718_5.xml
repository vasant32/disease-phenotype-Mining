<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess the usefulness of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>]fluorodeoxyglucose <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography in the detection of bone marrow involvement in malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and its impact in clinical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and six consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, referred for staging or restaging of Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=18) or non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=88), were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography scan and bone marrow biopsy of the iliac crest were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The assessment of bone marrow involvement by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was confirmed by histology and/or progression of bone marrow lesions in clinical follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 28 of 106 patients, bone marrow involvement was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> emission tomography was more sensitive (86%) than bone marrow biopsy (57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> emission tomography and bone marrow biopsy were concordant by positive correlation in 12 of 28 cases (43%) and by negative correlation in 77 of 78 cases (99%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and two cases of Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with positive <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography results and an initial negative bone marrow biopsy showed clinical progression of the bone marrow lesions and/or subsequent positive histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These were considered as false-negative results for bone marrow biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In seven of the 12 positive cases with negative bone marrow biopsy, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography uptake distant from the site of the biopsy was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In four cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the bone marrow biopsy was positive and the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography scan was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> emission tomography and bone marrow biopsy are complementary in assessing the presence of bone marrow involvement in patients with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In our series, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography was more sensitive than bone marrow biopsy in Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, except in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
