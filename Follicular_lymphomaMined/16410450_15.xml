<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incidence of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) in industrialized countries has been increasing since the 1950s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms in genes encoding key enzymes controlling <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>-methionine metabolism, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR), methionine synthase (MS or MTR), serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), and thymidylate synthase (TS or TYMS), modify the risk of various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and possibly FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study specifically looks for an association between MTHFR, MTR, TYMS, and SHMT polymorphisms and the risk of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We carried out a case-control study with 172 patients diagnosed with FL and 206 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report that the risk of FL was doubled by the association of one mutant allele at both MTHFR polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Individuals with MTR 2756AA had 2-fold higher risk of FL, and subjects not having at least one TYMS 2R allele showed a 2-fold higher risk of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The MTR 2756AA genotype conferred a greater multivariate-adjusted relative risk of FL, and the risk was multiplied by almost 5 in the TYMS2R(-)/MTR 2756AA combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, common polymorphisms in key enzymes of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>-methionine metabolism pathway result in an increased risk of FL and suggest that inadequate intake of dietary <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and other <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> donor nutrients may contribute to the development of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
