<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the implications of achieving Bcl-2/IgH negativity for the prognosis of FL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty seven patients (54%) were receiving only chemotherapy (CHT), 23 patients (46%) were receiving chemotherapy combined with monoclonal antibody anti/CD20, rituximab (R-CHT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Molecular genetic remission was achieved in 7 out of 11 patients (64%) after R-CHT, and only in 2 out of 14 patients (14%) after CHT- this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>4 weekly doses of rituximab were administered in a sequence to 17 out of 27 patients who had received only chemotherapy and failed to achieve complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>12 out of 17 patients (71%) on this therapy were Bcl-2/IgH positive prior to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>7 out of 12 (58 %) patients were no longer Bcl-2/IgH positive in a check performed after one month; the remaining 2 out of 5 patients had a negative Bcl-2/IgH record for the interval of 3 months (1 patient) or 6 (1 patient) months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The following factors were associated with the achievement of Bcl-2/IgH negativity at any point during the treatment: age &lt; 65 years (p = 0.02) and performance status 0 + 1 according to WHO at baseline (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients who were Bcl-2/IgH negative after treatment had a lower recurrence/progression risk rate than the Bcl-2/IgH positive group of patients, i.e. 27% vs. 75% (p = 0.03), and a higher chance for progression-free survival, i.e. 81% vs. 38% (p = 0.004), event-free survival, i.e. 74% vs. 38% (p = 0.01), and overall survival, i.e. 87% vs. 74% (p = 0.05) at 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our experience, achieving Bcl-2/IgH negativity after follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> therapy implies a better prognosis </plain></SENT>
