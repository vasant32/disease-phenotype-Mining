<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have performed a comparative, quantitative study of apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in germinal centres and in the neoplastic follicles of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e>-centrocytic, follicular, non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Cb/Cc NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten cases each of reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> and Cb/Cc NHL were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One-micrometre-thick resin-embedded sections were examined at x 1000 magnification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total numbers of cells, nuclear containing apoptotic bodies, and mitoses were counted in each follicle and the apoptotic and mitotic indices were derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transmission electron microscopy was performed on selected cases to confirm the typical features of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean apoptotic (4.9 per cent) and mitotic indices (0.9 per cent) for the germinal centres were significantly higher (P much less than 0.001) than those for the neoplastic follicles (0.9 and 0.14 per cent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results lend support to the recent proposal that reduced apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> may be important in the pathogenesis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
