<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 222 patients with FL were recruited from eight sites across the UK and they completed a number of PRO measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The participants were analyzed across five <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp>: 'active disease-newly diagnosed', 'active disease-relapsed', 'partial response', 'complete response' and 'disease free' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship between these <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> and their level of health functioning was assessed as well as the relationship between being 'on' or 'off' chemotherapy and disease state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In terms of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), participants in the relapsed category had the lowest mean physical well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being and social well-being score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a regression analysis, the 'active disease-relapsed' group acted as a significant predictor for each PRO variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the remission group acted as a significant predictor of high <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> scores as measured by the Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate that various aspects of patient-reported health outcomes differ according to disease state in patients with FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For those patients who have relapsed, they are more likely to experience worse HRQoL and other patient-reported health outcomes than patients newly diagnosed, in partial or complete remission or when completely disease free </plain></SENT>
