<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent findings suggest that genetic polymorphisms in TNF and IL10 are associated with an increased risk of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), particularly for diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the contribution of common genetic variation in key cytokine and innate immunity genes to the etiology of NHL, we genotyped participants in a case-control study of NHL conducted in Australia (545 cases, 498 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated 36 single nucleotide polymorphisms in IL10, TNF and 21 other immune function genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed an elevated risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> with the IL10 -3575T&gt;A polymorphism [TA genotype: odds ratio (OR)=1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.86-2.02; AA, OR=1.84, 95% CI=1.10-3.08; trend test, P=0.02] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our most noteworthy TNF finding was an association between -857C&gt;T and a decreased risk of NHL (CT or TT, OR=0.59, 95% CI=0.42-0.84, P=0.003) and particularly follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR=0.40, 95% CI=0.23-0.68, P=0.0009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, TNF -863C&gt;A was associated with an elevated risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (CA, OR=1.45, 95% CI=0.95-2.21; AA, OR=2.06, 95% CI=0.88-4.83; trend test, P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings offer further evidence that variation in the IL10 and TNF loci influences NHL risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional studies are needed to clarify the genetic and biologic basis for these relationships </plain></SENT>
