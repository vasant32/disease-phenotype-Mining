<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ninety percent of low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs) carry the t(14;18) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This event juxtaposes the bcl-2 oncogene to the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy-chain gene and leads to bcl-2 gene overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Morphologic transformation of FL to high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is associated with multiple secondary chromosomal abnormalities of the neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: To analyze whether additional structural alterations of the translocated bcl-2 gene are associated with morphologic transformation of FL, we PCR-amplified, cloned, and sequenced the major breakpoint region (MBR) and the open reading frames (ORF) of the translocated bcl-2 oncogene in six paired samples of FL and subsequent diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In five cases, FL and DLL cells were clonally related, as suggested by the identical MBR sequences, but in one case they were different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PCR single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and sequence analyses were performed for identification of structural alterations of the bcl-2 gene in the OFR region corresponding to the 239 amino acid p26-bcl-2a protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In three of the six patients, a total of 11 point mutations of the ORF were detected in the DLL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four of them, at positions 29, 46, 59, and 106, yielded amino acid replacements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that FL and DLL cells may be clonally related or unrelated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They also show that transformation of FL cells can be associated with somatic point mutations of the bcl-2 oncogene ORF sequence resulting in alteration of the p26-bcl-2a gene product </plain></SENT>
