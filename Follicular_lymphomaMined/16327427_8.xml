<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the features of bone trephine biopsy involvement by non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 450 specimens were evaluated for percentage of marrow involvement, pattern of involvement, presence of germinal centers or follicular structures, and discordance with other involved sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A subset of 197 cases was evaluated for evidence of concurrent peripheral blood involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follicular grade 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (30.4%) was the most common type to involve the marrow, followed by diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (16.0%), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (9.3%), low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, not otherwise specified (8.7%), lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (8.4%), follicular grade 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (7.1%), and mature T- and NK-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (6.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A mixed pattern of infiltration was most common, followed by paratrabecular, nodular, diffuse, and interstitial patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Greater than 90% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had at least a focal paratrabecular infiltration pattern, but this pattern was also seen with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interstitial disease infiltration tended to correlate with lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but was also not specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of germinal centers or follicular structures was associated with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 88% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Discordance between the bone marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and other tissue sites was observed in 24.9% of cases and was most often seen with follicular or diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood involvement by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was observed in 29% of cases, found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> disease groups except for follicular grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study highlights the frequency of different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patterns in the marrow, limitations of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> classification on biopsy material alone, and the relative frequency of marrow discordance and peripheral blood involvement by marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
