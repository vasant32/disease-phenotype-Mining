<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated four polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods for their efficiency in detecting monoclonality in a well-characterized panel of frozen and paraffin-embedded B-cell lymphoid proliferations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These approaches (referred to as FR3, FR3A, FR2, and FR1) are based on amplification of rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain genes, using primers recognizing framework regions I, II, or III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FR3, FR3A and FR2 approaches reproducibly detected monoclonality in 51%, 72%, and 67% of DNAs from frozen <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No false-positives were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combination of FR2 and FR3A methods raised the figure to 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparable results were obtained using paraffin-embedded <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reproducibility of FR1 approach was unsatisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The efficiency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> PCR approaches varied depending on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The highest detection rate was in small/intermediate cell and the lowest in centro-follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Limiting dilution assays showed that PCR methods were able to detect monoclonal B-cell DNA representing 5% of nonlymphoid and 20% of polyclonal B-cell DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A diagnostic protocol may include quick and cost-effective PCR screening, particularly in cases of undetermined small cell lymphoid proliferations observed in fine needle aspirates or endoscopic biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This would also reduce call-up of patients to obtain unfixed biopsies </plain></SENT>
