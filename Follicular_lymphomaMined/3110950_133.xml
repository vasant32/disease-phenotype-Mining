<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This technique permitted the detection of cells carrying the t(14;18) hybrid DNA sequences at a dilution of 1:100,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The remission marrow and blood samples of a patient with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the t(14;18) failed to show any abnormality by morphological examination and conventional Southern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the t(14;18) hybrid DNA sequences were detected by the PCR technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, this technique is a highly sensitive tool to detect minimal residual cells carrying the t(14;18) and has the potential to identify a subpopulation of patients with subclinical disease </plain></SENT>
