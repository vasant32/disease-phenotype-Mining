<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>About three quarters of the translocations are concentrated on the 3' nontranslated, a few hundred basepare-long region of bcl-2, the so called major breakpoint region (mbr), the remaining 20-25% is located about 30 kilobases downstream of bcl-2 coding sequences in the minor cluster region (mcr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The majority of the immunoglobulin breakpoints can be found in JH6-4 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The polymerase chain reaction method can detect the translocation already in a very few number of cells (&gt; 10(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This very sensitive technique makes it possible to detect the translocation in lymphoid/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of peripheral blood and bone marrow that are missed by other diagnostic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This way one can perform a quick, early diagnosis, examine the result of treatments as well as detect the remissions and the possible relapses right at the beginning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the advantages of this method contribute to a more successful treatment of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This present work describes a polymerase chain reaction technique which is capable of a detection of the t(14;18) translocation in a patient of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e>/centrocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, moreover shows how this translocation disappears after 4 week of radiotherapy of the patient </plain></SENT>
