<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, measurement of these genes in routine practice remains difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We applied real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to polyA cDNAs prepared from 106 archived human frozen lymph nodes (63 of FL, 25 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, 10 reactive lymph nodes, and cases with paired samples of FL [4] and subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> [4]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcription and polyA reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR was performed, and resultant cDNA was probed by real-time PCR for 36 candidate indicator genes, selected from microarray studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine genes showed statistically significant different expression between FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, including cyclin B, COL3A1, NPM3, H731, PRKCB1, OVGL, ZFPC150, HLA-DQ-a, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268136" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="XPBC">XPB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, cyclin B, NPM3, and COL3A1 were higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six genes showed statistically significant higher expression in the neoplastic nodes compared with reactive nodes, namely PRKCB1, BCL-6, EAR2, ZFX, cyclin B, YY1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High levels of YY.1 were associated with a shorter survival interval in both FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The method is simple, sensitive, and robust, facilitating routine use and may be used as a platform for clinical measurement of prognostic gene signatures </plain></SENT>
