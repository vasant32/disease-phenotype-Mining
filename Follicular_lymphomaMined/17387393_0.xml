<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present three cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) exhibiting prominent <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (sclerosing variant of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), resembling <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334121" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="IMT">inflammatory pseudotumor</z:e> (IPT) of the lymph node, arising from mesenteric lymph node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinically <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases represented bulky masses of the mesenteric lymph node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the lesions were characterized by neoplastic lymphoid follicles separated by stromal collagenization and sclerotic process, with cellular infiltrate extending into the adjacent adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lesions contained variable cellular spindle cell proliferation and inflammatory infiltrate including numerous reactive T cells and histiocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Small capillary proliferation with vascular change was also noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study demonstrated the myofibroblastic nature of the spindle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, neoplastic follicles were composed of intermediate to medium-sized lymphocytes, somewhat resembling reactive lymphoid aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall histomorphological findings of the three lesions were similar to those of IPT of the lymph node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, CD10, Bcl-2 and Bcl-6 immunostaining demonstrated the neoplastic nature of the lymphoid follicles and the lesions were diagnosed as FL grade 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present three cases indicate that the sclerosing variant of grade 1 FL should be added to the differential diagnosis from IPT of the lymph node </plain></SENT>
