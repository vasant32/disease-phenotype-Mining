<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 13 patients who presented solid spleen nodules, diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, or both on imaging studies (CT, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>, US) were biopsied under ultrasound control with 18G BioPince needles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytological (imprints and cytocentrifugates) and histological material were obtained for diagnosis in every case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were the most commonly found pathology (four diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, two follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, one B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, NOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was one littoral-cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp>, one well-differentiated neuroendocrine <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, metastatic, and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018916" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haemangioma</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining two cases showed congestive features, and supposed spleen involvement by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in one of them was ruled out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On follow up, there were no complications related to the core biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Splenectomy was performed in six cases, two diagnostic and four therapeutic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that core biopsy is a safe and efficient method in the diagnosis of spleen nodules that could be considered in the routine diagnostic algorithm of these lesions </plain></SENT>
