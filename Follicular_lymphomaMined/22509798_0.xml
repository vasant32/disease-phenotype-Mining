<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FL stroma contains a special type of stromal cell found in the germinal centre of lymph nodes-the follicular dendritic cell (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We first isolated tumourigenic cells from the FL cell line FLK-1 by side population (SP) technique, and found that SP cells, which express ABCG2, were enriched by chemotherapy and radiation treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro, SP cells were attracted by and adhered to <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> through chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12/chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCL12/CXCR4) signalling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo, limiting dilution assays showed SP cells were highly enriched in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem cells (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSC</z:chebi>), but required <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> formation in non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with AMD3100, a specific CXCL12/CXCR4 inhibitor, eliminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings were then verified with FL cells isolated from an FL patient's ascitic fluid (FLA-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, we detected the ABCG2 expressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in FL clinical specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, we found that the highly tumourigenic FL cells having <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSC</z:chebi>-like activities (FL-SC) interact with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> in a CXCL12/CXCR4 dependent manner to resist chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate the importance of FL-SC and niche cell signalling in maintaining tumourigenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These signals represent novel targets for <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSC</z:chebi> eradication </plain></SENT>
