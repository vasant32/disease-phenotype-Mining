<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An epidural growth of low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is even more unusual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to this low incidence, therapeutic experience for this entity is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report the outcome of 3 consecutive patients with primary spinal epidural follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Due to the clinical disorders of the patients and despite the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e>, we used an intensive multimodal therapy concept consisting of spinal decompression, systemic (immuno)chemotherapy and local irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients improved in their medical condition; 2 achieved a complete remission, 1 of these with long-term remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the established irradiation therapy for early-stage FL, an intensive multimodal therapy concept should be initiated in patients with primary spinal epidural FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With this approach, a fast improvement of the symptoms and long-term disease-free survival is possible </plain></SENT>
