<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conversely, MSCs support survival of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) B cells, in particular after exposure to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF) and lymphotoxin-alpha1beta2 (LT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of MSCs on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant B-cell growth in steady-state and inflammatory conditions remains to be fully explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show here that resting MSCs sustain activated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cell proliferation and survival, whereas IFN-gamma-conditioned MSCs mediate IDO-dependent B-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IFN-gamma, TNF, and LT are significantly overexpressed by the microenvironment of invaded FL-lymph nodes, but their relative expression patterns are highly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> between samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro, IFN-gamma abrogates the B-cell supportive phenotype induced by TNF and LT on MSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, IFN-gamma overrules the growth promoting effect of MSCs on primary purified FL B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Altogether, these results underline the crucial role of the cytokine context in the local crosstalk between malignant cells and their microenvironment and provide new insights into our knowledge of the FL cell niche that emerges as a new promising target for innovative therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
