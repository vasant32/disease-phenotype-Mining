<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) inexplicably vary markedly between Western and Asian countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A hallmark of FL is the bcl-2 translocation, characterized by 1 of 2 common breakpoints known as major breakpoint region (MBR) and minor cluster region (mcr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed previously published data to compare rates of bcl-2 translocation in FL across geographic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Available data from the literature suggest that the incidence of bcl-2 in healthy persons in the absence of FL may be as high as 50% in Western and Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in FL our results show that the frequency of bcl-2 positivity was significantly higher for US than for Asian populations (P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This pattern persisted for MBR and mcr subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a significant gradient exists in the bcl-2 frequency between these FL populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We therefore suggest that the relatively low incidence of FL in Asian populations is caused not by a lower frequency of bcl-2 rearrangements in healthy populations but by distinct molecular pathways developing in different geographic regions that nonetheless culminate in FL, which is morphologically similar but molecularly distinct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Studies demonstrating differences in clinical characteristics according to the presence or absence of bcl-2 rearrangements support this concept </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus we hypothesize that FL may in fact be a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> encompassing entities with distinct molecular pathogenesis and potentially distinct clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If these findings were confirmed in prospective studies, it would imply that different etiologic or genetic factors might influence the development of FL across separate regions </plain></SENT>
