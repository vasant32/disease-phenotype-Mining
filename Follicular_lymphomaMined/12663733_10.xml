<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess whether nonneoplastic Bcl-2/IgH rearrangements act as a confounding factor in the setting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> analysis by evaluating their incidence in a panel of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-free subjects, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-free donors and chemotherapy-naive and chemotherapy-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 501 nonlymphoma subjects have been assessed: 258 cancer-free patients and 243 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 112 of whom were chemotherapy-naive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were primarily assessed by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by real-time quantitative PCR if they scored positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, six initially PCR-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-free donors were prospectively reassessed by qualitative and quantitative PCR after 30 and 60 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall incidence of Bcl-2/IgH positivity was 9.6%, with a median number of 11 rearrangements per 1,000,000 diploid genomes (range, 0 to 2,845 rearrangements), as assessed by real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence was similar in healthy subjects and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients at diagnosis (12% and 12.5%; P = not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the incidence of this translocation was only 2.3% in chemotherapy-treated patients (P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, three initially PCR-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-free donors showed persistence of their rearrangements when assessed after 30 and 60 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The low incidence of nonneoplastic Bcl-2/IgH rearrangements following chemotherapy provides further evidence of the prognostic role of persistent PCR-positivity in the posttreatment molecular follow-up of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
