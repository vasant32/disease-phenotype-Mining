<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients received ISIS 3521 (2 mg/kg/day) as a continuous infusion over 21 days of each 28-day cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 53 years (range 37-77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histological subtypes were low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 22) and B-cell small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one (81%) had stage III/IV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median number of previous lines of chemotherapy was two (range one to six) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 87 cycles of ISIS 3521 were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients were assessable for response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients achieved a partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No complete responses were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had stable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Grade 3-4 toxicity was as follows: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (3.8%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (26.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ISIS 3521 has demonstrated anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> activity in patients with relapsed low-grade NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There may be a potential role for this agent in combination with conventional chemotherapy for advanced low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and further trials are warranted </plain></SENT>
