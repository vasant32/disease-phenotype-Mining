<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FL has a variable clinical course, and important clinical treatment decisions for FL patients are based on histological grading, which is done by manually counting the large malignant cells called centroblasts (CB) in ten standard microscopic high-power fields from H&amp;E-stained tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This method is tedious and subjective; as a result, suffers from considerable inter and intrareader variability even when used by expert pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we present a computer-aided detection system for automated identification of CB cells from H&amp;E-stained FL tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proposed system uses a unitone conversion to obtain a single-channel image that has the highest contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From the resulting image, which has a bimodal distribution due to the H&amp;E stain, a cell-likelihood image is generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, a two-step CB detection procedure is applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the first step, we identify evident nonCB cells based on size and shape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the second step, the CB detection is further refined by learning and utilizing the texture distribution of nonCB cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the proposed approach on 100 region-of-interest images extracted from ten distinct tissue samples and obtained a promising 80.7% detection accuracy </plain></SENT>
