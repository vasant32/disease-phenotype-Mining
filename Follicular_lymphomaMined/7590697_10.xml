<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Via a 14;18 chromosomal translocation, BCLP is overexpressed in most follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> as well as some other non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and it has also been documented in other nonlymphomatous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address the possible prognostic value of this marker in predefined subsets of non-small cell <z:mp ids='MP_0008714'>lung carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e>), the authors studied 126 T1N0M0 cases seen between the years 1986 to 1991 at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated by lobectomy (105 cases) or wedge excision (21 cases) with negative margins; neuroendocrine <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> grades were specifically excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 39 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining for BCLP was done using a monoclonal antibody (clone no. 124; DAKO, Carpinteria, CA), and the avidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-peroxidase complex (ABC) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study cases included 73 <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (ACs) as well as 40 squamous cell (<z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>), five adenosquamous (ASC), and eight large cell/poorly differentiated (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCC</z:e>) <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As assessed with the Kaplan-Meier method, overall survival was 64% at 5 years (66% AC vs 59% SC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BCLP was detected in 47 of 126 cases (37%) including 32 AC (44%), 10 <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> 925%), two ASC (40%), and three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCC</z:e> (38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in 5-year survival was noted in a comparison of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with BCLP expression (63%) and those without (59%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was, however, a significant difference in the survival of grade 1 BCLP(+) cases, when compared with grade 2 or 3 BCLP(+) cases (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A nonstatistically significant trend toward increased survival was observed in BCLP(+) <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> cases (66% 5-year survival in BCLP[+] vs 45% in BCLP[-] [P = .11]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Proportional hazards analysis failed to disclose significant independent risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that bcl-2 protein immunoreactivity has limited prognostic value in the pathological evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
