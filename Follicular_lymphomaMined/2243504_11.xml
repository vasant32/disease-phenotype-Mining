<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rearrangement of the bcl-3 gene was found in only one case; a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involving the salivary gland that had progressed to a diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conclude that rearrangement of the bcl-3 gene as detected by our method occurs rarely in mature B or T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
