<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 45% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples (287/644) were positive, and 40% of the positive samples (114/287) contained more than one positive clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of t(14;18)-positive cells showed a strong correlation with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 36 cord blood samples and 48 PBMNCs from children &lt;10 years were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of circulating positive cells increased from the second to fifth decade of life from 20% to 66% and remained stable thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also the median frequency of circulating t(14;18)-positive cells as well as the prevalence of multiple clones showed an increase with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 4% (24/644) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> blood samples contained &gt;1 positive cell in 25,000 cells, a finding restricted to healthy individuals &gt;40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results are discussed in relation to the low incidence of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
