<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By using (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin((R))), a radionuclide (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">yttrium</z:chebi>-90, linked by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi> tiuxetan to the antibody ibritumomab) is brought into the vicinity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By the so-called cross-fire effect, this beta emitter has the capacity to destroy not only the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells having bound the antibody, but also neighboring <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Currently this antibody is licensed in the European Union for use in relapsed or refractory FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is anticipated that this drug will also be approved for use as consolidation therapy after successful first-line treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we first will review the published literature supporting the use of (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan in the aforementioned indications and emerging data showing applicability of ibritumomab tiuxetan as sole first-line therapy for FL, as well as in the transplant setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Possible strategies of incorporating ibritumomab tiuxetan into the treatment algorithm of FL are discussed </plain></SENT>
