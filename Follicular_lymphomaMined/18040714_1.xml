<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of FLs in Western countries have the former chromosomal changes with characteristic clinical features and low histological grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to investigate the characteristics of Korean FLs with regard to the underlying molecular defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one cases of FL were evaluated from two centers in Korea by immunostaining for CD10, bcl-2, and bcl-6 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed to detect the t(14;18) and t(3q27) break </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases with FL grade 3 accounted for 57% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 61 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18) was detected in 43.9% of the cases studied, and the frequency was 80, 50, 34.8, and 9.1% from grade 1 through grade 3b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The t(3q27) was detected in 16.1% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cases without a t(14;18) were mainly histological grade 3 (P &lt; 0.001) and had a tendency to have the t(3q27) and bcl-2 amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of t(14;18)-positive low-grade FL was found to be lower in Korea than in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The increased frequency of t(14;18)-negative grade 3 FL attributes to the lower incidence of t(14;18) in Korean FL </plain></SENT>
