<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-15 (IL-15) has been extensively studied for its role in the survival and proliferation of NK and T cells through a unique mechanism of trans-presentation by producer cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conversely, whereas activated B cells have been described as IL-15-responding cells, the cellular and molecular context sustaining this effect remains unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found that, whereas human B cells could not respond to soluble IL-15, monocytes and lymphoid tissue-derived macrophages but not stromal cells efficiently trans-present IL-15 to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells and cooperate with T-cell-derived CD40L to promote IL-15-dependent B-cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CD40L signaling triggers a Src-independent upregulation of STAT5 expression and favors a Src-dependent phosphorylation of STAT5 in response to IL-15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), immunohistochemical studies reported a strong relationship between malignant B cells, infiltrating macrophages and T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show here an overexpression of IL-15 in purified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated macrophages, and STAT5A in purified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, FL B cells respond to IL-15 trans-presented by monocytes/macrophages, in particular, in the presence of CD40L-mediated signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This cooperation between IL-15 and CD40L reinforces the importance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> microenvironment and unravels a mechanism of FL growth that should be considered if using IL-15 as a drug in this disease </plain></SENT>
