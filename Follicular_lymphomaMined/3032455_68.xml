<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have cloned the mouse bcl-2 (mbcl-2) genomic locus and analyzed it in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gene is comprised of two exons separated by more than 15 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two species of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> are produced, and DNA sequencing analysis shows that they code for two proteins differing at their C terminus: a 7.5 kb transcript codes for a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> of 236 amino acids, mbcl-2 alpha, and a 2.4 kb transcript, which derives from the 5' exon only, codes for a protein of 199 amino acids, mbcl-2 beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The gene is characterized by very long (5' about 1.4 kb, and 3' about 5.1 kb) untranslated regions surrounding the relatively short coding region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have mapped the 5' end of the mbcl-2 mRNAs by S1 protection analysis, and we have analyzed the promoter region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of the mbcl-2 gene was analyzed in different cell lines and in mouse tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression is tissue-specific in adult tissues: spleen and thymus express the highest level of mbcl-2 transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mbcl-2 gene maps to mouse chromosome 1 </plain></SENT>
