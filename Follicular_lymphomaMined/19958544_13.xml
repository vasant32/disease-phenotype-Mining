<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: MI-319 is a synthetic small molecule designed to target the MDM2-P53 interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is closely related to MDM2 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> MI-219 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46742">Nutlin-3</z:chebi> in terms of the expected working mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> activity of MI-319 in WSU-FSCCL, a B-cell follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For comparison purpose, MI-319, MI-219 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46742">Nutlin-3</z:chebi> were assessed side by side against FSCCL and three other B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological tumor</z:e> cell lines in growth inhibition and gene expression profiling experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MI-319 was shown to bind to MDM2 protein with an affinity slightly higher than that of MI-219 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46742">Nutlin-3</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, cell growth inhibition and gene expression profiling experiments revealed that the three compounds have quite similar potency against the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines tested in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro, MI-319 exhibited the strongest anti-proliferation activity against FSCCL and four patient cells, which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> have <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data obtained from Western blotting, cell cycle and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> analysis experiments indicated that FSCCL exhibited strong cell cycle arrest and significant apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; cells with mutant p53 did not show significant apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> with drug concentrations up to 10 muM, but displayed weaker and differential cell cycle responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our systemic mouse model for FSCCL, MI-319 was tolerated well by the animals, displayed effectiveness against FSCCL-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in blood, brain and bone marrow, and achieved significant therapeutic impact (p &lt; 0.0001) by conferring the treatment group a &gt; 28% (%ILS, 14.4 days) increase in median survival days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Overall, MI-319 probably has an anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> potency equal to that of MI-219 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46742">Nutlin-3</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is a potent agent against FSCCL in vitro and in vivo and holds the promises to be developed further for the treatment of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that retains <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 </plain></SENT>
