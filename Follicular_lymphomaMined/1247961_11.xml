<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 49 males and 51 females, almost evenly distributed between nodular (49) and diffuse (51) patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were seen in patients under age 20 and they were twice as common as nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in patients over 60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were predominantly lymphocytic (61%) or mixed (35%) while diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were commonly histiocytic (43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Standardized pathological staging was based upon the serial performance of bone marrow needle biopsy, percutaneous hepatic biopsy, peritoneoscopic hepatic biopsies and exploratory laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients this sequence terminated with the first positive biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hepatic involvement was documented in 40 patients by either percutaneous biopsies,18 peritoneoscopic biopsies,9 or wedge biopsy at laparotomy.13 Thirty-seven of 49 patients who underwent laparotomy had biopsy-proven abdominal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall incidence of biopsy-proven abdominal disease was 64% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Positive spleens varied widely in weight but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> negative spleens weighed less than 270 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Constancy of histologic type in multiple sites was observed in 90% of cases </plain></SENT>
