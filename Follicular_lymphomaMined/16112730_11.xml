<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is generally considered an indolent disorder but a significant subset of patients shows a worse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim of this study was to validate the FLIPI score in an independent series of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients and to correlate prognostic categories with the period of diagnosis and the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated the clinical characteristics, prognostic stratification, and outcome of 338 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> consecutively diagnosed and followed at our Institution between 1975 and 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The distribution of patients within the prognostic categories of the IPI and FLIPI score, while confirming the indolent outcome of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, shows that a subset of patients has a worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the IPI score, 62% of patients are in the low risk, 26% in the low-intermediate, and 12% in the high (high-intermediate+high) risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the FLIPI score, 48% of patients are categorized as low risk, 31% as intermediate risk, and 21% as poor risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With the IPI score, median OS is 17.3 years for the low risk; 6.3 for the intermediate risk, and 5.2 years for the high risk group (p=0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With the FLIPI system, median OS is 15.5 years for the low risk, 8.3 years for the intermediate risk, and 5.2 for the poor risk group (p=0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prognostic scores were calculated also after dividing patients according to the time of diagnosis: in three periods (before 1987, between 1988 and 1997, and from 1998), as well as in two periods (before and after 1998) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the periods studied survival of patients classified according to IPI and FLIPI categories was significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study shows in an independent series that the FLIPI score is a reproducible prognostic index of clinical utility for the initial assessment of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
