<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, SMCD infiltrates in the spleen and lymph node have a broad spectrum of morphological patterns which can make it difficult to recognize the diagnosis, especially when specimens are examined from patients in whom SMCD is not suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the pathological features of 16 spleen and 23 lymph node specimens from 19 patients which represented <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available material from a series of 58 Mayo Clinic patients with SMCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the pathological manifestations of SMCD involvement in the spleen and lymph node and to address difficulties in differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> compartments of the spleen and lymph node were found to be affected by SMCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SMCD lesions in the spleen were found in a paratrabecular (92%), parafollicular (69%), follicular (15%), and a diffuse red pulp (8%) distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the lymph node, mast cell infiltrates affected the paracortex (88%), the parafollicular region (50%), the follicles (25%), the medullary cords (13%), and the sinuses (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mast cells were frequently found in a perivascular location, and associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> was common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because of the broad spectrum of histological manifestations of SMCD in the spleen and lymph node, a wide range of differential diagnoses is discussed including follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, monocytoid B-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100726'>Kaposi's sarcoma</z:hpo>, and Langerhans' cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
