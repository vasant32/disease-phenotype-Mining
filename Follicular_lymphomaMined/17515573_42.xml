<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aim of this retrospective analysis was to determine the outcome of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who received myeloablative therapy supported by autologous bone marrow transplantation as consolidation of second or subsequent remission, with a minimum follow-up of 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-one adults received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) and total-body irradiation (TBI) supported by autologous bone marrow transplantation, with the marrow mononuclear cell fraction having been treated with monoclonal antibodies and complement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data from St Bartholomew's Hospital and Dana-Farber <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute were combined for the purpose of this analysis because the patients were treated in an identical manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients are alive, 41 without progression between 9 and 19 years; 64 patients have died, 20 without progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 13.5 years, 60 patients have developed recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is an apparent plateau on the remission duration curve at 48% at 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival of patients treated in second remission was significantly longer than the survival of patients treated later in the course of the illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both remission duration and overall survival were also significantly longer for patients treated in second remission compared with an age-matched, remission-matched group of patients treated at St Bartholomew's Hospital before the introduction of this treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, use of CY+TBI was associated with a significant risk of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, resulting in 15 patient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These mature data confirm that prolonged freedom from recurrence may be achieved with myeloablative therapy and that a plateau on the curve seems to emerge with long follow-up </plain></SENT>
