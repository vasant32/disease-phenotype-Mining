<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neoplastic follicles within follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed similar patterns to that observed in reactive follicles, which appeared to be strongly associated with the presence of follicular dendritic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of low and intermediate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> grade revealed features comparable to those of interfollicular areas of reactive lymphoid tissue, irrespective to which compartment the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells were related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Highly malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, however, displayed unique extracellular matrix configurations, resulting from active matrix degradation by macrophages; this may support rapid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed virtually the same matrix patterns as their nodal counterparts, suggesting that (malignant) lymphoid cells generate (at least partly) their own specific microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In reactive lymphoid tissue beta 1 integrins were mainly found on resident cells and except for alpha 4, alpha 5 (and beta 1) the lymphoid cells expressed very little, if any, beta 1 integrins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In comparison, expression of these integrins on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells was reduced (follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) or could not be detected at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (diffusely growing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>); this might contribute to the growth pattern and metastatic properties of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
