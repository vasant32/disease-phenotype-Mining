<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify some aspects of the natural history of FL, we retrospectively examined 43 consecutive patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> with pre- or coexisting FL grade 1 or 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients comprised 22 men and 21 women with a median age of 53 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients (34/43) showed advanced-stage (III or IV) disease initially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined both FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> components morphologically, immunohistochemically, and by interface fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH: IGH/BCL2 fusion, BCL6 translocation) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> were classified as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> subtype, with two exceptions of the anaplastic subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of both the FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> components revealed the following respective positivity rates: CD20 100%/100%, CD10 86%/66%, Bcl-2 96%/91%, Bcl-6 84%/88%, MUM1 16%/34%, CD30 0%/20%, CD138 0%/0%, and CD5 0%/3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Loss of CD10 (6/36, 17%) and gain of MUM1 (7/28, 25%) and CD30 (5/21, 24%) through transformation were not infrequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High positivity rates for Bcl-2 and Bcl-6 were maintained throughout transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e>, 84% were classified as the germinal center B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> (GCB) and 16% as non-GCB in accordance with the criteria of Hans et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IGH/BCL2 fusion was detected by FISH in 89% of FLs and 82% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>BCL6 translocation was detected in 1/6 (17%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> without IGH/BCL2 fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, although the morphological features and FISH results for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> were consistent with transformed FL, the immunophenotype showed wide <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
