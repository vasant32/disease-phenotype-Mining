<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To examine outcome of treatment for patients with recurrent follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred twelve newly diagnosed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred seventy-nine were initially treated successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recurrent or progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> developed in 116 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment was given according to disease stage and current protocols, mostly with single <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A policy of repeated lymph node and bone marrow biopsy was pursued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall median survival duration was 9 years, with a median follow-up duration of 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following recurrence, the median survival duration was 4 1/2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only eight of 116 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> died of causes unrelated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate to first re-treatment was 78% and showed slight decline with successive recurrences, reaching 48% after the fourth treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median duration of second remission was 13 months, (v 31 months for first remission), with the only significant predictive factor being quality of remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed only age at recurrence and number of prior treatments to correlate with survival after first recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Survival after second remission was only correlated with age and quality of response: Kaplan-Meier estimates gave 53% of patients reaching second complete remission alive 10 years later, compared with 28% in partial remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Age and previous and continuing responsiveness of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to therapy are the principal determinants of survival following recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Improvement in survival with new treatments will be demonstrated most readily in older patients, while more intensive approaches should be tested in younger patients in whom remission is achieved with difficulty </plain></SENT>
