<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report the long-term results of central lymphatic irradiation for stage III nodular malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1969 and 1985, 34 patients (26 with nodular poorly differentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, four with nodular mixed lymphocytic/histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and four with nodular histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) were treated with central lymphatic irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median age of the group was 51 years (range, 30 to 73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 15 men and 19 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Staging work-up included a physical examination and bone marrow biopsy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy-four percent had a lymphangiogram (LAG) and 44% a laparotomy (LAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighty-two percent had either a LAP or a LAG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients were Ann Arbor stage IIIA and two were stage IIIB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received lymphatic irradiation that encompassed cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, paraaortic, mesenteric, pelvic, and femoral lymphatics to total doses ranging from 20 to 30 Gy in 1.0- to 1.8-Gy fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Waldeyer's ring was initially treated in 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up information is available on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 34 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up is 9 years, 8 months (range, 15 to 244 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Life-table actuarial overall, disease-free, and cause-specific survival rates at 15 years are 28%, 40%, and 46%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Only one relapse was observed after 9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival was significantly improved in patients with five or fewer sites of involvement (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, B symptoms, histology, and technique of irradiation were not prognostically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Salvage therapy, including further irradiation and/or chemotherapy, was delivered to 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Ten percent of these patients remain alive without evidence of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Toxicity data were available for the patients treated at the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Radiation Therapy <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group (RTOG) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hematologic, gastrointestinal, and salivary toxicity scores were &lt; or = 2 in 83% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Late toxicity scores were &lt; or = 2 in 96% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000217'>xerostomia</z:hpo> was noted in 23% of patients who received initial treatment to Waldeyer's ring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that initial comprehensive central lymphatic irradiation may be the preferred approach to achieve a durable relapse-free interval for this group of patients </plain></SENT>
