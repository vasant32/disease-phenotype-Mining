<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were stratified, based on preclinical data, into arm A (mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) or arm B (other B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) without limitation in number of prior therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">Bortezomib</z:chebi> was administered as an intravenous push (1.5 mg/m2) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 every 21 days for a maximum of six cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty patients with a median number of prior therapies of 3.5 (range, one to 12 therapies) were enrolled; 33 patients were in arm A and 27 were in arm B, including 12 diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, five follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL), three transformed FLs, four small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>), two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024419" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemias</z:e> (WM), and one marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In arm A, 12 of 29 assessable patients responded (six complete responses [CR] and six partial responses [PR]) for an overall response rate (ORR) of 41% (95% CI, 24% to 61%), and a median time to progression not reached yet, with a median follow-up of 9.3 months (range, 1.7 to 24 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In arm B, four of 21 assessable patients responded (one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e> patient had a CR, one FL patient had a CR unconfirmed, one diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patient had a PR, and one WM patient had a PR) for an ORR of 19% (95% CI, 5% to 42%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 toxicity included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (47%), gastrointestinal (20%), <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (13%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (10%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Grade 4 toxicity occurred in nine patients (15%), and three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from progression of disease occurred within 30 days of withdrawal from study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">Bortezomib</z:chebi> showed promising activity in relapsed mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and encouraging results in other B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Future studies will explore <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> in combination with other cytotoxic or biologic agents </plain></SENT>
