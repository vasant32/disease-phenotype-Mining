<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The natural history of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is to accrue large cells and become diffuse, resulting in progression/transformation to a higher-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histologic transformation occurs in approximately 60% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most often, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> transform into diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> classified using the Working Formulation as diffuse mixed, large cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e>, or small noncleaved cell also have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evidence of transformation may be found over time in sequential biopsy specimens, or may coexist in the same biopsy specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe six cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, large cell in five cases and mixed in one case, that transformed into a diffuse or sinusoidal CD30 antigen-positive large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with anaplastic cytologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both the follicular and diffuse/sinusoidal components were of B-cell lineage, positive for the CD20 antigen and negative for the CD3 and CD43 antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neoplastic cells expressed monotypic immunoglobulin light chain in five cases, three kappa and two lambda </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BCL-2 protein was positive in four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, in both the follicular and diffuse/sinusoidal components in three cases, and only in the latter component in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), three of six cases had monoclonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18) was not amplified in any case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, the t(2;5) was amplified in one of four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This report highlights the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of B-lineage anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and indicates the need to consider antecedent follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in any B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with anaplastic cytologic features </plain></SENT>
