<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because phosphorylation status of Akt/protein kinase B is regulated by <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, we monitored total and phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50161">MGd</z:chebi>-treated HF-1 and Ramos cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levels of pAkt increased within 30 minutes after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50161">MGd</z:chebi> treatment of HF-1 but after 4 hours began to show a progressive decline to below baseline levels before cells underwent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50161">MGd</z:chebi>-treated Ramos cells, pAkt increased approximately 2-fold within 4 hours and remained persistently elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because pAkt activates survival pathways, we determined if <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50161">MGd</z:chebi>-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> could be enhanced by inhibiting phosphorylation of Akt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The addition of specific inhibitors of Akt phosphorylation (Akt inhibitor 1 or SH-5) reduced pAkt levels in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50161">MGd</z:chebi>-treated HF-1 and Ramos cells and synergistically enhanced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50161">MGd</z:chebi>-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50161">MGd</z:chebi> was also evaluated in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi>, an inhibitor of Akt phosphorylation, or docetaxel, a microtubule inhibitor that can decrease Akt phosphorylation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data point to a potential protective role for pAkt in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50161">MGd</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50161">MGd</z:chebi> activity may be enhanced by combining it with agents that inhibit Akt phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
