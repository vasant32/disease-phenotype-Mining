<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> typically has acquired a t(14;18) translocation, but subsequent additional cytogenetic abnormalities contribute to disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main aims of the study are to (a) identify the frequency and temporal sequence of cytogenetic events in t(14;18)-positive follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, (b) determine if there are specific pathways in the evolution of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, (c) determine the clonal divergence in cases with sequential biopsies or multiple clones from a single biopsy, and (d) determine the association of genetic imbalances with clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and cytogenetic analysis showing t(14;18)(q32;q21) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The karyotypes were reviewed and cytogenetic data were entered into a relational database for further computational analysis; 418 biopsies from 360 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients including 43 sequential biopsies were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the cases with only one or two genomic imbalances, the most frequent chromosomal imbalances were +7, del(6q), +der(18)t(14;18), +18, and +X </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities were also among the most frequent ones encountered when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> karyotypes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetically abnormal clones in the same (26%) and sequential biopsies (63%) often showed divergence of genetic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Balanced translocations other than the t(14;18) were uncommon events, but chromosomal breaks involving 14q32, 18q21, 1p36, 1q21, 10q22, 10q24, and a large cluster at 6q occurred relatively frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>del(6q), +5, +19, and +20 were associated with poorer overall survival, and del(17p) was associated with poorer event-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lower-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (1 and 2) were associated with fewer imbalances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggested that +der(18)t(14;18) may be an entry point to a distinct pathway of genetic evolution in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The other common early events appeared to provide multiple entry points, and they might cooperate in the pathogenesis and progression of the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetically abnormal clones from same patients often showed divergence of genetic alterations, suggesting that parallel evolution from precursor clones are frequent events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study provides the framework for further analysis of genetic pathways of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
