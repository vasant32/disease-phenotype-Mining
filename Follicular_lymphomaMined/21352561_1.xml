<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment of early stage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> is a matter of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radiation therapy has frequently been applied with a curative approach beside watchful waiting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Involved field, extended field and total nodal radiation techniques are used in various protocols, but the optimal radiation field still has to be defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is characterized by stable expression of the CD20 antigen on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The anti CD20 antibody Rituximab (Mabthera®) has shown to be effective in systemic therapy of FL in primary treatment, relapse and maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS/DESIGN: The MIR (Mabthera® and Involved field Radiation) study is a prospective multicenter trial combining systemic treatment with the anti CD20 antibody Rituximab (Mabthera®) in combination with involved field radiotherapy (30 - 40 Gy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This trial aims at testing the combination's efficacy and safety with an accrual of 85 patients.Primary endpoint of the study is progression free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints are response rate to Rituximab, complete remission rate at week 18, relapse rate, relapse pattern, relapse free survival, overall survival, toxicity and quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The trial evaluates the efficacy of Rituximab to prevent out-filed recurrences in early stage nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the safety of the combination of Rituximab and involved field radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It also might show additional risk factors for a later recurrence (e.g. remission state after Rituximab only) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials (NCT): NCT00509184 </plain></SENT>
