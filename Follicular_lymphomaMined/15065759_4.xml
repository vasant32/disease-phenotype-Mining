<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules play in the biological and clinical behaviour of non Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) has been reported in several studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study reports the findings on B-cells taken from various healthy control tissues and compared them to B-cells from 83 malignant B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, that had been classified according to the WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry was used to investigate the surface expression of CD31, an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule involved in B-cell development and vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantification of the fluorescence signals showed specific patterns of CD31 expression on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cell subpopulations and different NHL groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that CD31 expression is modulated during the differentiation process in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cells, high in pre-B-I cells, low in pre-B-II precursors, intermediate in the mature B-cell subpopulations or, depending on the functional state absent in activated follicular centre cells, present in pre- and post- germinal centre cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the CD31 expression is evaluated as fluorescence intensity in NHL, it reveals a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> pattern related to histogenetic derivation (high in small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, low in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, intermediate in marginal zone and large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that CD31 might well play a critical role in the ontogeny and <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of B-lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, on the basis of these observations we propose the CD31 molecule as an interesting additional useful parameter to be used for the differential diagnosis of NHL and hypothese that it has a pathophysiologic role in NHL evolution </plain></SENT>
