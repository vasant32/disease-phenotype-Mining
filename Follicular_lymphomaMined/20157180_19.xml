<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This phase I/II study evaluated its safety and efficacy in patients with relapsed/refractory follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) after prior rituximab therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Design and methods: Forty-seven patients were treated in three dose cohorts and received eight infusions every 3 weeks: cohort A, 200 mg/m(2) (n = 15); cohort B, 375 mg/m(2) (n = 16); cohort C, first dose 375 mg/m(2), seven subsequent doses of 750 mg/m(2) (n = 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were assessed for safety, efficacy, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median patient age was 58 years, the majority had Ann Arbor stage III/IV disease and had received a median of 2 (range 1-6) prior regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ocrelizumab was well tolerated with grade 3/4 toxicity occurring in 9% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common toxicity was infusion-related reactions (74% patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> grade 1/2 except one grade 3 event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The objective response rate was 38% and was similar in patients with low-affinity and high-affinity variants of the Fcgamma receptor IIIa (FcgammaRIIIa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With follow-up of approximately 28 months, the median progression-free survival was 11.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ocrelizumab demonstrated activity in patients with relapsed/refractory FL following prior rituximab treatment, with safety similar to rituximab although adverse events appeared milder </plain></SENT>
