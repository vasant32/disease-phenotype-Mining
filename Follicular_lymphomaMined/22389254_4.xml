<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, patients with rituximab-refractory FL received 8 weekly infusions of ofatumumab (CD20 mAb; dose 1, 300 mg and doses 2-8, 500 or 1000 mg; N = 116) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age of these patients was 61 years, 47% had high-risk Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index scores, 65% were chemotherapy-refractory, and the median number of prior therapies was 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 13% and 10% for the 500-mg and 1000-mg arms, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 27 patients refractory to rituximab monotherapy, the overall response rate was 22% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median progression-free survival was 5.8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-six percent of patients demonstrated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> reduction 3 months after therapy initiation, and the median progression-free survival for these patients was 9.1 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common adverse events included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000989'>pruritus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients experienced grade 3 infusion-related reactions, none of which were considered serious events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Grade 3-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> occurred in a subset of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ofatumumab was well tolerated and modestly active in this heavily pretreated, rituximab-refractory population and is therefore now being studied in less refractory FL and in combination with other agents in various B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
