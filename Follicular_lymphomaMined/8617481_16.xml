<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have reported that low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> have variable B-cell monoclonality detection rates by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For instance, monoclonal B-cell populations from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are most often readily amplified with a single primer pair, whereas follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and plasma cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> require alternative strategies to approach these higher diagnostic sensitivity standards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because most published reports have not focused on the variation in PCR B-cell monoclonality detection among subtypes of intermediate and high-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, additional information is necessary to determine primer selection strategies and identify problematic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> subtypes within this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current investigation, the third part in a series, was aimed at documenting the efficiency of B-cell monoclonality detection by PCR in 71 aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> of various types using a comprehensive approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A predetermined panel of primer sets was used in an algorithmic fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specifically, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples were analyzed with the standard VH-FRIII/JH assay previously shown to have the highest efficiency of monoclonality detection within low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Negative samples were further evaluated with primer sets in the following order until a positive result was observed, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> primer sets were used: (1) bcl-2/JH, (2) VH-FRI family specific/JH, and (3) VH-FRI consensus/JH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-three (61%) of the 71 B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> evaluated with VH-FRIII/JH showed monoclonal B-cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sequential use of the three reserve primer sets in samples negative with this initial primer pair resulted in an overall improvement in PCR detection from 61% to 82% (58 of 71 specimens) (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The VH-FRI family specific assay identified B-cell monoclonality in 11 (73%) of these 15 specimens and was the most productive reserve primer set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Individual categories exhibited the following initial (I) and final (F) PCR detection rates: <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>/lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 11 specimens (I = 91% to F = 91%); small noncleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 14 specimens (I = 79% to F = 86% [P &gt; .25]); diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 33 specimens (I = 52% to F= 85% [P &lt; .005]) and large cell, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 13 specimens (I = 38% to F = 62% [P &lt; .01]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The authors have shown that comprehensive PCR analysis is capable of detecting B-cell monoclonality in a significant proportion of samples from each subtype of intermediate and high-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The VH-FRIII/JH assay was an adequate initial primer set, but required augmentation with the reserve PCR assays to attenuate the false negative rate and improve diagnostic sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The B-cell clonality PCR assay is optimally used as a screening tool and when used in this fashion, the more laborious and time-consuming restriction fragment-Southern blot hybridization (RF-SBH) method for IgH gene rearrangement detection may be limited to a relatively small proportion of PCR-negative aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
