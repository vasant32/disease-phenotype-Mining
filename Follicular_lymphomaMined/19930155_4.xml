<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe novel humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) developed for therapeutic use on the basis of their physicochemical properties and cellular cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A distinct correlation between apparent dissociation constants (K(d)) and apoptotic activity for eight murine anti-CD20 mAbs (OUBM1-OUBM8) and previously-developed murine anti-CD20 mAbs enabled us to categorize anti-CD20 mAbs into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group A mAbs had lower K(d) values and did not induce definite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, while Group B mAbs had greater K(d) values and did induce definite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A murine version mAb of rituximab, 2B8, belongs to Group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> analysis showed that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> of two murine mAbs, OUBM3 and OUBM6, differed from that of 2B8 or 2F2 (ofatumumab) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two mAbs, OUBM3 from Group A and OUBM6 from Group B, were selected and humanized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As expected, the humanized OUBM3 with the lower K(d) did not induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, while the humanized OUBM6 (hOUBM6) with the greater K(d) did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both hOUBM3 and hOUBM6 induced highly-effective, complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity against Burkitt's and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, hOUBM6 exhibited cellular cytotoxicity against diffuse, large B cells that are less effectively depleted by rituximab and also exhibited effective cytotoxicity against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells from human CD20(+) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the potential impact of the further development of our anti-CD20 mAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study shows that the selection of mAbs based on their physicochemical parameters, followed by the biological activity assessment for the selected mAbs, is a rational and efficient approach for pharmaceutical mAb development </plain></SENT>
