<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clonal chromosome abnormalities were observed in 30 patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was characterized on the basis of the International Working Formulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 30 patients were classified into five groups according to the chromosome abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 8 patients with t(14;18), 3 with t(8;14), 7 with a translocation to the long arm of chromosome 3 (a 3q+ chromosome), 5 with near-tetraploidy, and 7 with other abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 8 patients with t(14;18), 5 had follicular small cleaved-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FSC), I had follicular mixed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FM), and 2 had diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DL); the diagnosis in these 2 patients was based on extranodal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 patients with t(8;14) had DL and B-cell markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Except for 1 patient, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> those with a 3q+ chromosome had DL; 4 of those who were tested had B-cell or pre-B-cell markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four of the 5 patients with near-tetraploidy had follicular mixed-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 2 of the 7 patients with other abnormalities had T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, patients with a t(8;14), a 14q+ chromosome, or a 3q+ chromosome <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tend to have diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, usually of the non-cleaved type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, our data suggest that patients with FSC generally have a t(14;18) whereas those with follicular and diffuse mixed small cleaved cells and large noncleaved cells have a different pattern with modal chromosome numbers in the tetraploid range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We added 17 previously reported patients to the 30 presented here and correlated the karyotype with survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 6 patients with near-tetraploidy had the longest median survival, 69 months, the 15 patients with t(14;18) had the next longest, 48 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 4 patients with t(8;14) had the shortest survival, 12 months, and the 9 with other abnormalities had the next shortest, 17 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Intermediate survivals of 27 and 30 months were observed in patients with a 14q+ or a 3q+ chromosome, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The median survival of these various categories differs and our data, thus, indicate that the karyotypic pattern of the malignant cell may be a significant independent prognostic feature influencing the survival of patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
