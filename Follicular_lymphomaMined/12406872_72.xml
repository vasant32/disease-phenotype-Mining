<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Genomic aberrations in a series of paired biopsy samples from patients who presented initially with follicle center <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FCL) and subsequently transformed to diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) were measured by array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The consequences of these aberrations on gene expression were determined by comparison with expression analysis on these specimens using cDNA microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> pattern of acquired genomic abnormalities was observed upon transformation, some of which were recurrent in small subsets of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some of the genomic aberration acquired upon transformation, such as gain/amplification of 1q21-q24, 2p16 (REL/BCL11A gene loci), 3q27-q29 (including the BCL6 locus), 7q11.2-q22.1, 12pter-q12, 18q21 (including the BCL2 locus) and Xq, and deletion of 6q22-q24, 13q14-q21 and 17p13 (P53 locus) have been previously implicated in the FCL/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, novel genomic imbalances not previously reported in association with FCL transformation, such as overrepresentation of 4p12-pter, 5p12-p15, 6p12.3-p21, 9p23, 9q13-q31, 16q, 17q21, and loss of 1p36.3, 4q21-q23, 5q21-q23, 9q31-qter, 11q24-q25, and 15q23, were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed a differential expression profile of many genes within regions of gain and deletion upon transformation, including novel target genes associated with FCL transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, other genes did not show deregulated expression despite their location within these areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, the combination of array CGH and expression analysis provides a more comprehensive picture of the transformation of FCL to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This process is associated with the acquisition of a variable spectrum of genomic imbalances affecting recurrent chromosomal areas that harbor overexpressed or underexpressed genes targeted upon transformation </plain></SENT>
