<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an intent-to-treat analysis, overall response was 76%, of which 47% (8 patients) were a complete response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 33.6 months, 7 complete responders remained alive and free of disease, and 2 partial-response patients remained stable without additional treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Actuarial curves showed that at 3 years, 53% of patients should be alive and free of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 4 patients who were failures died secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall survival at 3 years was 76% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was mild; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients completed the schedule on time and doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The addition of two doses of anti-CD 20 clearly improved the outcome in a group of patients with refractory follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> heavily treated and poor prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the number is too small to drawn definitive conclusions, and more clinical trials are necessary to determine if four of six doses of anti-CD20 therapy are better in this setting of patients </plain></SENT>
