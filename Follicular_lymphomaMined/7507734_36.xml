<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The B-lymphocyte/accessory-cell activation antigen B7 (BB1) has been shown in vitro to stimulate T-lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production via CD28 present on the latter cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, benign lymphoid tissues, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and extralymphoid inflammatory sites were examined immunohistochemically using anti-B7 and other relevant monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>B7 was expressed by benign transformed germinal center B cells, as it was by B cells of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>B7 was also expressed by a subpopulation (a mean of 31% to 65%) of macrophages and dendritic cells in a variety of lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was present in abundance on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> macrophages constituting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333419" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">sarcoid granulomas</z:e> in lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In extralymphoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, 17% to 35% of macrophages expressed B7 only weakly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> showed expression of B7 by the majority of Reed-Sternberg cells or malignant mononuclear variants, a phenomenon that potentially contributes to the lymphocytic accumulation that is a feature of this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD28+ T cells were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> areas where T cells were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>B7+ and CD28+ cells colocalized in, for example, lymphoid follicles, lymph node paracortex, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333419" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">sarcoid granulomas</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> tissue, indicating a potential for cellular interaction via these molecules at these sites </plain></SENT>
