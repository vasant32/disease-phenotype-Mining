<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The BCL6 gene encodes a POZ/Zinc-finger protein, which acts as a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is expressed in B cells within the germinal centers (GC) and is required for GC formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In approximately 40% of diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DLCL) and approximately 14% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL), the BCL6 gene is rearranged by chromosomal translocations, which juxtapose heterologous promoters and 5' untranslated sequences derived from other chromosomes to the BCL6 coding domain or by mutations in the 5' regulatory region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To understand the functional consequence of the chromosomal translocations, we have studied the patterns of expression of the promoters found juxtaposed to BCL6 in DLCL and FL during B-lineage differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Distinct heterologous 5' untranslated regions (IGH, IGL, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi>) were identified fused to the BCL6 coding domain by analysis of BCL6 cDNAs in two DLCL cases and one mixed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (MxFL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These three sequences, as well as three other previously identified BCL6 fusion partners (IGHG3, BOB1, H4), were studied for their pattern of expression during B-lineage differentiation by Northern blot analysis of B-cell lines representation by Northern blot analysis of B-cell lines representative of the pre-B, B, immunoblast, and plasma cell stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to BCL6, whose transcription is activated only in B cells within the GC, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the other sequences displayed a broader pattern of expression ranging from constitutive expression throughout B-cell differentiation to persistent expression in immunoblasts and plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the expression of BCL6 is deregulated as a consequence of fusion to heterologous promoter regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The persistent expression of activated BCL6 may contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> by blocking B-cell differentiation within the GC </plain></SENT>
