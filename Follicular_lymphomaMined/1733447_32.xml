<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(1989) reported that its presence indicated poor response to therapy and short survival, whereas Levine et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(1988) showed no difference in prognosis between cases with and without the translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However these results were based on small series of cases and on follow-up periods (no longer than 7 years) which are relatively short for a disease with such a slow clinical evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we report an investigation of 70 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with long term follow-up data (up to 17 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This series has been studied for the presence of the 14;18 translocation and for the expression of bcl-2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results show that there are no grounds for considering either the 14;18 translocation or the expression of the bcl-2 protein to be useful prognostic markers in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
