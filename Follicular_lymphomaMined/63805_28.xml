<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were B-cell type </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> survived significantly longer than those with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (P = 0-00003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For patients with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, however, surface markers provide prognostic information not obtainable by histological classification as "poorly differentiated lymphocytic" or "histiocytic" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients whose malignant cells had B markers survived significantly longer than those whose malignant cells had no markers (P=O-008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival of patients with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was best predicted by a classification utilising both surface markers and histological appearances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences in survival among patients with B-cell and "null" or T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> may relfect differences in sensitivity to specific drugs </plain></SENT>
