<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) is a powerful tool for the imaging of various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite its high FDG avidity, there is little data on PET in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this work, we present findings concerning PET at staging and posttreatment evaluation in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 181 PET scans were evaluated in 117 patients with FL in a retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> emission tomography-based results were compared with conventional staging in 82 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Posttreatment PET evaluation was performed in 99 patients; there were comparable progression-free survivals of PET-positive and PET-negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> emission tomography showed more involvement than computed tomography (CT) with clinical examination in 41 of 82 patients (50%), less in 11 of 82 (13%); the same extension was found in 27 of 82 patients (33%), and 3 patients revealed discordant foci visible on PET only and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> without PET activity (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Including the results of trephine biopsy, PET finally upstaged FL in 15 of 82 patients (18%), which was projected in change of treatment strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 73 of 99 negative posttreatment PET scans; 54 of 73 PET-negative patients (74%) remain in complete remission (median follow-up, 27 months); 19 (26%) of them relapsed with median of 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of 20 (70%) PET-positive patients relapsed with a median of 4.5 months regardless of findings on CT and subsequent therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The difference in relapse rates between PET-positive and PET-negative patients is statistically significant (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> emission tomography at staging is able to substantially change treatment strategy in an important proportion of patients with FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Persisting PET positivity after treatment predicts for a high risk of an early relapse and can identify patients with poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
