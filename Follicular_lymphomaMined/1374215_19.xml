<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were women (median age, 45 years) and they usually had breast masses that had recently become enlarged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sites of the lesions were the right breast in eight cases, the left breast in eight, and both breasts in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The locations of two masses were unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> recurred in the opposite breast in three cases 14, 23, and 23 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histologically, diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was the most common form of disease (63%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One lesion was a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The so-called lymphoepithelial lesion, a characteristic finding for mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, was observed in eight cases (42%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were of B-cell type; such findings confirmed morphologically based conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histologic and immunohistochemical evidence of lymphocytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006145" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mastopathy</z:e>, a recently described <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> of the breast, was found in most of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Formation of lymphoid follicles in or around the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> was found in five cases (26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, it is suggested that most mammary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and they may be associated with coexisting or antecedent lymphocytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006145" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mastopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
