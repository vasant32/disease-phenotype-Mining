<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A specific-binding protein was found in three of these sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Scatchard analysis of cytosol from a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line revealed binding sites with a Kd of 7.0 X 10(-11) and a receptor concentration of 6.6 fmol/mg protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">Sucrose</z:chebi> density centrifugation of 3H-1,25(OH)2D3 labeled cytosol showed a 3.75 peak which was absent in cytosols incubated with excess nonradioactive 1,25(OH)2D3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relative amounts of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28940">vitamin D3</z:chebi> metabolites required to displace 50% of the specifically bound 3H-1,25(OH)2D3 were 1,25(OH)2D3: 1,24,25(OH)3D3: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17933">25(OH)D3</z:chebi>: 24,25(OH)2D3 = 1: 180: 1000: 2700 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Excess <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28940">vitamin D3</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> failed to displace 3H-1,25(OH)2D3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Scatchard analysis of spleen cytosol from a patient with prolymphocytic transformation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> demonstrated a binding protein with a Kd of 1.2 X 10(-10) and a receptor concentration of 0.2 fmol/mg protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DNA cellulose binding confirmed the presence of the specific-binding protein in this cytosol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Specific binding of 3H-1,25(OH)2D3 was also quantitated in a cell line from a patient with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with a Kd of 0.3 X 10(-10) and a receptor concentration of 29.6 fmol/mg protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No specific binding of 3H-1,25(OH)2D3 was observed in lymphocytes from seven other malignant and nonmalignant sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results are the first to demonstrate a specific-binding protein for 1,25(OH)2D3 in lymphocytes from tissue and from these specific cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presence of this protein in some lymphocytes but not others may reflect the state of activation of the lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
