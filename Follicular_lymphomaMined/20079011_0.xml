<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 74 fresh tissue samples clinically suspicious of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were investigated by FISH using three probes including IgH/bcl-2, IgH/CCND1 and API2/MALT1, corresponding the translocation t(14;18), t(11;14) and t(11;18) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of FISH were analyzed and compared with the histopathologic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histological evaluation eventually confirmed that there were 62 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 12 cases of reactive lymphoid processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The translocations were detected in 7 cases in 62 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>: 3 demonstrated t(14;18) including 2 cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 1 nodular sclerosing Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four cases had t(11;14) including mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (2 cases), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1 case) and small cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> case showed detectable t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 25 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> showed no evidence of t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Amplification or loss of regional genes was seen more often in malignant than in the benign cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Interphase FISH offers useful ancillary technology that plays an important role in differential diagnosis and classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
