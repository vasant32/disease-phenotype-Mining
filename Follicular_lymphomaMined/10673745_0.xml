<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the possible role of anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> antibody detected in a case of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> which demonstrated the spontaneous reduction of leukemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells genotypically had monoclonal rearrangements of the immunoglobulin J H and C kappa genes, but phenotypically exhibited surface IgG, A, kappa and lambda (kappa lambda dual positivity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The culture study revealed that IgGlambda, at least, was derived from the serum, and IgAkappa was expressed intrinsically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the positive correlation between the densities of both surface light chains on two-color flow cytometry, the rosette formation study and its inhibition test by the Fcgamma fragment suggested that the serum IgGlambda combined with some antigens on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-cell surface via its Fab portion and with the Fcgamma receptor of macrophages via its Fc portion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From these findings, we regarded the present case as an anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> antibody-coated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the phagocytic study disclosed that the serum-derived IgGlambda, at least, might have induced the phagocytosis of circulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells by macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the existence of the anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> antibody-coated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> may be helpful in clarifying the immunological mechanism of the spontaneous regression occasionally seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
