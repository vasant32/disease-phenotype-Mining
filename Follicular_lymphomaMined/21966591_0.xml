<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims were to correlate individual marrow metabolic changes after chemotherapy with bone marrow biopsy (BMBx) for its potential value of personalized care in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>26 patients (mean age, 58 ± 15 y; 13 female, 13 male) with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, referred to FDG-PET/CT imaging, who had BMBx from unilateral or bilateral iliac crest(s) before chemotherapy, were studied retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maximal standardized uptake value (SUV) was measured from BMBx site over the same area on both initial staging and first available restaging FDG-PET/CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>35 BMBx sites in 26 patients were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>12 of 35 sites were BMBx positive with interval decrease in SUV in 11 of 12 sites (92%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining 23 of 35 sites were BMBx negative with interval increase in SUV in 21 of 23 sites (91%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The correlation between SUV change over the BMBx site before and after chemotherapy and BMBx result was significant (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This preliminary result demonstrates a strong correlation between marrow metabolic changes (as determined by FDG PET) after chemotherapy and bone marrow involvement proven by biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This may provide a retrospective means of personalized management of marrow involvement in deciding whether to deliver more extended therapy or closer followup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
