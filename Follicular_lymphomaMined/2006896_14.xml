<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found a statistically significant increase in the risk of developing non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (RR = 1.4) and a slight, nonsignificant excess for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (RR = 1.2) among individuals who lived .8-3.2 km (1/2-2 miles) from a factory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Risks were greater for certain histologic types: follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (RR = 1.5), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (RR = 5.4), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (RR = 2.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (but not for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>), the relative risks for those living within .8 km (1/2 mile) of a factory were similar or slightly larger than for those living .8-3.2 km (1/2-2 miles) from a factory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risks did not increase with duration of residence near a factory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The elevated risks of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were particularly associated with residing near stone, clay, or glass industry facilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was greater among persons who resided near chemical and petroleum plants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These preliminary findings raise the possibility that general environmental exposure associated with certain industrial activities may elevate the risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of data on proximity to industrial plants from studies in other geographic locations is needed to determine whether our results represent a meaningful association </plain></SENT>
