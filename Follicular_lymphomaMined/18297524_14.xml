<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a chromosome 6 specific tile path array, 60 samples from in total 49 cases with mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>), de novo diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), transformed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> as well as preceding follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), and childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), were characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six of the studied cases, representing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diagnoses, showed a 6q deletion among which 85% involved a 3 Mb region in 6q21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The minimal deleted interval in 6q21 encompasses the FOXO3A, PRDM1 and HACE1 candidate genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PRDM1 gene was found homozygously deleted in a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> cases, an overlapping homozygous deletion was identified in 6q23.3 - 24.1, encompassing the TNFAIP3 gene among others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, we refined the deletion pattern within the long arm of chromosome 6 in four different types of hematological malignances, suggesting the location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes involved in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
