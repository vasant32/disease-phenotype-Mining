<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The streptavidin <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> peroxidase complex method was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 46 of 49 cases of reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> the follicle center cells were unstained by MT2 whereas the mantle zone B cells and interfollicular T cells were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In three reactive cases up to 30% of follicle center cells also were stained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, more than 50% of neoplastic follicle center cells were stained by MT2 in 27 of 62 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1511945" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CB/CC</z:e>, and light chain restriction was shown in 52 of 62 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MT2 staining and/or light chain restriction was seen in 57 of 62 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 106 further cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, MT2 was positive in 59 of 77 B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 3 of 29 T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although not a B cell specific reagent, MT2 is useful in the differential diagnosis of reactive vs. neoplastic follicular lymphoid proliferations but is less sensitive than immunoglobulin stains </plain></SENT>
