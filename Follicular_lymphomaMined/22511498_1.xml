<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Treatment of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with rituximab is currently recommended at a dose of 375 mg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to provide a rationale for optimal dosing and scheduling of this anti-CD20 antibody based on pharmacokinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Clinical efficacy of immunochemotherapy with rituximab, fludarabine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> followed by 2-monthly rituximab maintenance was evaluated in 29 patients with previously untreated follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in a prospective phase II trial (AGMT-NHL9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic analysis was assessed in 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Induction treatment resulted in high clinical response rates (complete remission 66%; ORR 100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher complete remission rates were observed in female patients (86 vs. 47%; Odds Ratio 6.8, 95% CI: 1.12; 41.82; P=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rituximab pharmacokinetic analysis showed a high variability ranging over almost 1 order of magnitude at maintenance cycle 1 (area under the curve 1,540-12,025 g/L*days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median area under the curve was lower in men (81%) and in patients with initial bone marrow infiltration (76%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher rituximab serum concentrations before next therapy (C(trough)) were associated with female sex (P=0.04) as well as with absence of initial bone marrow infiltration (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>C(trough) correlated with remission quality (complete vs. partial remission; P=0.005) and progression-free survival (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A decline in rituximab C(trough) below 25,000 ng/mL was observed 9.5 to 62 months before clinical relapse (P=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot trial suggest that more differentiated dosing schedules based on gender and bone marrow infiltration should be explored for rituximab therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT01560117) </plain></SENT>
