<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results on the infiltration were related to histological and clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A mean of 4.099 +/- 350 HNK 1+ cells/microliter <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue was found, which was comparable to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (reactive) lymphatic tissues (4.441 +/- 1.235) and was about a quarter of the population density of T helper/inducer (TH) and T cytotoxic/suppressor (TS) lymphocytes together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of HNK 1+ cells within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> was diffuse except in nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of follicular center cell origin (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e>/centrocytic = cb/cc NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When evaluating the different histological subgroups, the highest number of HNK 1+ cells was found within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> areas of cb/cc, which contained about three times as many positive cells as the other NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High numbers were also found in the diffuse variant of cb/cc but not in centrocytic NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Different degrees of HNK 1+ cell densities were observed in lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (4.426 +/- 754), with high numbers in about 30% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Splenic tissues of 6 hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> displayed lower numbers of HNK 1+ cells as compared with other low grade malignant NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In "large cell" NHL, the lymphoblastic subtype showed only sparse HNK 1+ cells (1.345 +/- 386) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number was significantly reduced in comparison to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other NHL (p less than 0.01) and markedly lower than in the other NHL of high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> NHL, p less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The diminuation was not due to a simple dilution phenomenon in a rapidly proliferating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, as TH and TS infiltrates were comparable to other NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Correlating results with the clinical course (available in 58 patients), significantly higher numbers of HNK 1+ cells were found in NHL of low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> (p less than 0.02), but patients with a favourable course did not differ from those with progressive disease (p less than 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients treated by cytotoxic drugs showed higher numbers of HNK 1+ cells than those before or without treatment (p less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Results on TH and TS cell numbers in comparison to HNK 1+ cells showed completely different patterns of infiltration </plain></SENT>
