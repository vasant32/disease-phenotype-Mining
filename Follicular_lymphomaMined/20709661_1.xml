<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Based on historical data on the role of radioimmunotherapy (RIT) in pretreated non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we reviewed our hospital's clinical database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2005 and 2008, 57 patients previously treated with at least 1 rituximab-containing chemotherapy were treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">Yttrium</z:chebi>-90-labeled ibritumomab tiuxetan ((90)Y-IT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median number of pretreatments was 3 (range, 1-9 pretreatments) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 46 patients had stage III/IV disease (31 with bone marrow involvement); 6 had bulky disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to histology, 53 were follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), 2 were marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 2 were small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall response rate was 93% (53 of 57); complete response (CR) rate was 70% (40 of 57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six of 40 patients (65%) who obtained a CR are in continuous CR (CCR) with a median follow-up of 20 months (range, 10-42 months); 4 of them still maintain their CCR after 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients achieving a CCR had FL, and 21 of them with stage III/IV disease; 12 of 26 had been heavily pretreated (&gt;or= 3 previous treatments), and 2 had had autologous stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was primarily hematologic and mostly transient; no grade 4 extrahematologic toxicity was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study confirms the safety and high efficacy of (90)Y-IT RIT in heavily pretreated FL patients, with the possibility of having a subset of long-term responders </plain></SENT>
