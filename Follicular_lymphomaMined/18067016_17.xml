<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We sought to identify biologic indicators of prognosis in a series of 94 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) patients, focusing on markers of the host immune response as well as of B-cell maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immune response was assessed with immunostains for CD68 (for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-associated macrophages, LAMs) and FOXP3 (regulatory T-cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were evaluated for expression of bcl-2, CD10, and MUM-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were obtained for FLIPI, presence of bulky disease, presence of B-symptoms, treatment, and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the 69 initially treated patients, extrafollicular CD68+ cells (ef-CD68) and follicular FOXP3+ cells (f-FOXP3) were associated with shorter OS, while receipt of rituximab was associated with longer OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis showed ef-CD68 was the only independent factor associated with shorter OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In subset analysis, ef-CD68 remained statistically significant in rituximab-na√Øve but not rituximab-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We confirm the importance of LAMs and f-FOXP3 as predictors of OS in FL </plain></SENT>
