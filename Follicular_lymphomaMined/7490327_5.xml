<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tonsil very few T cells in the follicle centre expressed MIB1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proliferating T cells were concentrated in the T cell zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same pattern was observed in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the percentage of T cells expressing MIB1 was higher in mucosa associated lymphoid tissue type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, suggesting that T cell activation occurs in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The highest percentage of MIB1 positive T cells was observed in high grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that transformation to high grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is associated with an increase in T cell activation </plain></SENT>
