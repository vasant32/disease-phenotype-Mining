<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: A pilot study to validate the use of CD34+ selection (Ceprate SC) of blood stem-cell collection in patients with advanced follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> receiving myeloablative chemoradiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients were entered onto the protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of 17 patients have undergone transplantation; the median age is 42.5 years (range, 33 to 51), seven of 13 are stage <z:mp ids='MP_0010560'>IVB</z:mp>, two stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IVA</z:e>, three stage IIIB, and one stage IIB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> except two patients were treated after first or subsequent relapses after receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHOP) chemotherapy to achieve a good partial (six of 13) or complete (seven of 13) response before stem-cell mobilization with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 3 g/m2 and filgrastim 300 microg once daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven of 13 patients had a detectable t(14;18) by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median CD34+ count before selection was 2.9 x 10(6)/kg (range, 1.17 to 11.3) and after CD34+ selection was 1.54 x 10(6)/kg (range, 0.88 to 7.6) with a median CD34+ yield of 62.4% (range, 17% to 95%) and purity of 60% (range, 39.3% to 73%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 11 patients known to have t(14;18), 10 had PCR-detectable contamination of stem-cell harvests that became PCR negative in six of the 10 after CD34+ selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Engraftment was rapid with a median day to absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/L of 13 days (range, 11 to 21) and platelet count greater than 20 x 10(9)/L of 14 days (range, 10 to 44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up duration of 15 months, three patients have remained persistently PCR-positive, two of whom received PCR-positive stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two have relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the seven patients who received PCR-negative stem cells, five have had no PCR-detectable disease in posttransplant bone marrow samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Longer follow-up duration is required to determine the significance of these findings, but we have confirmed the feasibility of CD34+ selected cells to deplete peripheral-blood stem cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells from patients undergoing high-dose therapy for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
