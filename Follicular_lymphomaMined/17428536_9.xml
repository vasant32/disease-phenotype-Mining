<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since patients with FL eventually develop resistance to conventional anticancer agents, and due to BCL-2 overexpression present with profoundly compromised execution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> pathway of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, targeting alternative pathways of cell demise may appear therapeutically beneficial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein we report for the first time the effects of an ER-Golgi transport inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48080">Brefeldin A</z:chebi> (BFA), alone and in combination with a small molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor HA14-1 or agonistic anti-Fas mAb, in the recently established human FL cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cell lines tested were sensitive to BFA-induced cytotoxicity and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover BFA-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was associated with profound ER stress, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> breach and subsequent caspase cascade activation, including caspase 2 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, BFA-induced ER stress did not result in appearance of autophagic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in FL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of importance, small molecule Bcl-2 antagonist, HA14-1 and agonistic anti-Fas mAb significantly enhanced BFA-mediated cytotoxicity and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, revealing novel and previously unexplored means to enhance ER stress-mediated cell killing in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
