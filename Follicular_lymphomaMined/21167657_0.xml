<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of a 2×2 Gy (total dose, 4 Gy) palliative radiation therapy (RT) regimen for treating patients with indolent non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) in terms of response rate, response duration, and symptom relief </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective chart review was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between 2003 and 2007, 54 patients with NHL were treated to 85 anatomical sites with a 2×2 Gy palliative regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Local response was assessed by clinical and/or radiographic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptoms before and after treatment for each site treated were obtained from clinical notes in patient medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up time was 1.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For the 54 patients, the median age at time of treatment was 71.1 years old, and 57% of them were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 85 disease sites treated, 56% of sites had indolent histology, 28% of sites were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), 13% of sites had aggressive histology, and 2% of sites were shown to have other histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall response rate (ORR) was 81% (49% complete response [CR], 32% partial response [PR]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 2-year rate for freedom from local progression was 50% (95% CI, 37%-61%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ORR for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), and marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>) histology was 88%, compared with a 59% rate for CLL histology (p=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While the ORR was similar for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of different sizes, the CR rate for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>&lt;5 cm tended to be higher than those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>&gt;10 cm (CR rate of 57% vs. 27%, respectively; p=0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For the 48 sites with clearly documented symptoms at pretreatment, 92% of sites improved after low-dose RT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Short-course low-dose palliative radiotherapy (2×2 Gy) is an effective treatment that results in high response rates for indolent non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This treatment regimen provides effective symptomatic relief for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> bulk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sizes </plain></SENT>
