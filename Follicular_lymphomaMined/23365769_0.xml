<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were potentially vaccine preventable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient then developed pneumococcal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> due to a serotype 35F pneumococcus with a unique Multilocus Sequence Type (ST7004) which was not vaccine preventable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient management was influenced by host predisposition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032269" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pneumococcal infection</z:e>, antibiotic intolerance, and poor response to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi> pneumococcal vaccine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indirect immunofluorescence with anti-human immunoglobulin confirmed a poor or intermediate response to Pneumovax II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="42355,48923">erythromycin</z:chebi> was initiated, and immunoglobulin transfusions were also commenced as a preventive strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ST7004 is a single locus variant of ST1635 which has been associated with the serotype 35F capsule in England </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The spi gene in ST7004, which differentiates it from ST1635, is the same as the spi gene present in ST191 which could have arisen from the first disease episode suggesting that horizontal gene transfer may have occurred between different populations of pneumococci present within the patient in an attempt to evade vaccination selection pressure </plain></SENT>
