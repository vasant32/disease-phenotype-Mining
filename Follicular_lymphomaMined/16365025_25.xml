<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DNA synthesis and methylation, which are closely linked to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> metabolism and transport, may be affected by polymorphisms in genes involved in these pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">Folate</z:chebi> metabolism polymorphisms have been linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate whether genetic variation in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> metabolism and transport may have a role in determining the risk of developing NHL, we analyzed several polymorphisms using DNA obtained as part of a large U.K. population-based case-control study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms studied include <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) 677 C &gt;T and 1298 A &gt;C, methionine synthase (MTR) 2756 A&gt;G, serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT1) 1420 C &gt;T, thymidylate synthase (TYMS) 1494del6 and 28-bp repeat, and reduced <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> carrier (RFC) 80 G &gt;A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased risks for NHL [odds ratio (OR), 1.48; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.12-1.97], and marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR, 3.38; 95% CI, 1.30-8.82) were associated with the TYMS 2R/3R variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Marginal increased risks were also observed for diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with the TYMS homozygous 6 bp deletion (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 0.99-2.60) and for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with RFC 80AA (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 0.94-2.22) and TYMS 28-bp repeat 2R/3R (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.96-2.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed no association between NHL and haplotypes for MTHFR or TYMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings are somewhat inconsistent with those of others, but may reflect differences in circulating <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels between study populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, further investigations are warranted in larger series with dietary information to determine the roles that genetics and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> status play in the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
