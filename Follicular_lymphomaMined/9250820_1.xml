<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 7 years (range 2-9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the duration of survival of 33 patients with only abnormal karyotypes, 35 patients with a mixture of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal karyotypes (AN) and 10 patients with only <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes (NN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was true for the entire group (p = 0.6) as well as for the subsets of diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DL) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) (p = 0.6 and 0.4, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>Monosomy</z:mp> 14 was the only abnormality in the entire group of patients to be associated with a statistically significant difference in survival duration (p = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the FL patients, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 7 (p = 0.046) and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 12 (p = 0.010) were associated with shorter survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Presence of t(14;18) did not influence survival in the entire group (p = 0.16), nor in any of the histological subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the FL patients with t(14;18), presence of additional cytogenetic abnormalities was not associated with a worse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lack of consistency of results between various studies is likely to be due to several factors and the prognostic significance of karyotypic abnormalities can only be clarified by large prospective studies employing uniform treatment policies </plain></SENT>
