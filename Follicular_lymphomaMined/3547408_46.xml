<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis of a panel of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> DNAs using probes for the first exon of the bcl-2 gene indicates that DNA rearrangements may also occur 5' to the involved bcl-2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this case the IgH locus and the bcl-2 gene are found in the order 3' C gamma S gamma/mu JH 5'::5' bcl-2 3' (where C = constant, S = switch, and JH = joining segment of the heavy chain locus), suggesting that an inversion also occurred during the translocation process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The coding regions of the bcl-2 gene, however, are left intact in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> studied to date </plain></SENT>
