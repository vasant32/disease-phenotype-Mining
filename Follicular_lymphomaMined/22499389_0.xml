<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the validity of automated measurement of the MIB-1 positive area is analyzed as an alternative approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Archival MIB-1 stained tissue sections of 15 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were assessed manually and automatically by three independent observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concordance correlation coefficients and coefficients of variation were calculated to study reproducibility and variability of both methods and to compare result from both methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A good concordance was observed between the two methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reproducibility of the automated method was slightly better than the manual counting of positive nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measurement of MIB-1 positive surface area may be used as a simple and fast alternative to tedious manual counting of positive nuclei as a potential help in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grading </plain></SENT>
