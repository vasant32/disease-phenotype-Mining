<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients may be characterized by differences in the level and activity of relevant biomolecules in diseased cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When high throughput, high dimensional data is available, it becomes possible to characterize differences not only in the level of the biomolecules, but also in the molecular interactions among them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We propose here a novel approach to characterize patient specific signaling, which augments high throughput single cell data with state nodes corresponding to patient and <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp>, and learns a Bayesian network based on this data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Features distinguishing individual patients emerge as downstream nodes in the network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We illustrate this approach with a six phospho-protein, 30,000 cell-per-patient dataset characterizing three comparably diagnosed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and show that our approach elucidates signaling differences among them </plain></SENT>
