<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To analyze long-term outcomes and causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients receiving radiation therapy (RT) for localized, low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1972 and 2000, 106 patients with Stage I-II, Grade 1-2 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> received RT alone or radiation and chemotherapy (RT/CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-four percent had Stage I, and 26% had Stage II disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six percent received RT alone, and 24% received combined RT/CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Second malignancy</z:e> rates were compared with an age- and sex-matched population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median follow-up was 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median survival time was 19 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-, 10-, and 15-year overall survival (OS) rates were 93%, 75%, and 62%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age &gt; or = 60 was the only significant adverse prognostic factor with respect to OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 35 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, 20 of which were attributable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Freedom from treatment failure (FFTF) rates at 5, 10, and 15 years were 72%, 46%, and 39%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven patients (48%) relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> size &gt; 3 cm was the only significant adverse factor for FFTF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Observed incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancy</z:e> did not significantly exceed expected incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although patients with early-stage, low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> have long median survival, the leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> remains <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, patients receiving RT do not have significantly elevated cumulative incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
