<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies of staging have suggested that with respect to therapy disease is either limited (stage I or II) or advanced (stage III or IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow biopsy is important as an initial staging tool, and retroperitoneal evaluation (lymphangiography, ultrasound) is important when marrow involvement is not present and also as a means of establishing a baseline for clinical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For patients with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, combination chemotherapy can produce high rates of complete remission, but relapses occur and survival has not been shown to be improved as compared to patients receiving single-agent therapy; the value of therapy is asymptomatic patients is not established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, advanced histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which is rapidly fatal when single-agent therapy is used, is cured in half of patients receiving new combination chemotherapy regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While clinical discussions must use the Rappaport system of pathologic classification, because most data have been expressed using this terminology, it should be recognized that immunologic approaches to the classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> exist, and that their clinical utility is undergoing evaluation </plain></SENT>
