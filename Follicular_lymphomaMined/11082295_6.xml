<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of TGF on cell cycle progression of a non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtype (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 48 h of TGFbeta1 (10 ng/ml) treatment, a significantly increased number of DoHH2 cells was retained in G(0)/G(1) phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the level of cell cycle components, cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk), and their inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the expression of cyclin A and p21(WAF1) molecules was primarily modulated by TGFbeta1 treatment while the expression of other regulatory components, like cyclins D, cyclin E, cdk2, cdk4, and cdk6 or p15(INK4B), p16(INK4A), and p27(KIP1) was not significantly affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We further examined expression and activity of CREB/ATF family members to examine their roles in cyclin A inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The binding activity of CREB-1 and ATF-2 to the CRE region of the cyclin A promoter was almost completely abolished due to the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total level of CREB-1, ATF-2, and ATF-3 was notably reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, CREB-1 was dephosphorylated due to the treatment as revealed by immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We assume that down-regulation of cyclin A was mediated by the absence of CREB/ATF activation dimers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The profound effect on the ATF family of transcription factors indicates the complexity of TGFbeta1 action on FL B malignant cells </plain></SENT>
