<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is a relatively uncommon type of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) thought to derive from follicular center cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are limitations to fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> in the diagnosis of follicular NHL, and very few studies are available on it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe here the cytomorphologic features of eight biopsy-proven cases of follicular NHLs and five biopsy-proven cases of intermediate-grade NHLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five cases of reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> (RLH) diagnosed on cytology were also studied cytomorphologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Image morphometry was done in follicular and intermediate-grade NHLs, immunocytochemistry was done in follicular and intermediate-grade NHLs, and immunocytochemistry for bcl-2 expression was studied in five cases of follicular NHLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aspirate smears of follicular NHL showed the presence of higher grades, many to abundant (++ to +++) monomorphic lymphoid aggregates, with an increased number of mast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lymphohistiocytic tangles and tingeable body macrophages were not observed in any of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytomorphologically, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases of intermediate-grade NHL showed a predominantly monomorphic population of lymphoid cells with absent or few grades (+) of lymphoid aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Image morphometric data analysis of each cell parameter for follicular and intermediate-grade NHLs were found to be statistically insignificant (P &gt; 0.05) and hence of little help in diagnosis of follicular vs. low-grade NHLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemistry for bcl-2 expression in follicular NHL showed variable results, ranging from 0-90% (expressed as bcl-2 index) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Certain characteristic cytomorphological features such as the presence of monomorphic lymphoid cell aggregates and an increased number of mast cells are soft indicators for the diagnosis of follicular NHL on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> smears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemistry for bcl-2 expression may be of help in cases with clinical and cytological suspicion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Image morphometry has a small role in this regard </plain></SENT>
