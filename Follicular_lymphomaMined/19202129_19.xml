<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genealogic trees showed a pattern compatible with a common progenitor cell (CPC) origin in 13 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The identification of the t-FL clonotype in the previous FL sample and of the putative CPC sequence in both the FL/t-FL biopsies showed that the intraclonal diversity of FL and t-FL germinal centers (GCs) is more intricate than previously described, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 clonotypes (CPC, FL, t-FL) may occur simultaneously within the same lymph node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the father/son model, this CPC must be long-lived, providing a possible explanation for the incurable nature of this disease </plain></SENT>
