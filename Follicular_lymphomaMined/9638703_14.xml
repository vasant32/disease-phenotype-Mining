<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report deregulation of bcl-2 expression during progression from oral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_129'>epithelial dysplasia</z:mpath> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis with monoclonal antibodies to bcl-2 oncoprotein in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections revealed that severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_129'>epithelial dysplasias</z:mpath> had a higher percentage of immunoreactivity than did mild and moderate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of this oncoprotein was directly proportional to the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_129'>epithelial dysplasia</z:mpath>, and nondysplastic basal cells contiguous to neoplastic lesions also expressed bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings, along with down-regulation of bcl-2 in differentiating <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, suggest a role for this oncoprotein in relatively early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026640" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oral tumor</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differentiating neoplastic cells with marginal or no bcl-2 reactivity showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> cell labeling of varying intensity for differentiation-associated cytokeratin (CK13), indicating their inverse topographic relationship </plain></SENT>
