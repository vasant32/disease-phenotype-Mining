<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The etiology of most <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> remains unclear, though several hypotheses have been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the conjectured mechanisms is <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> clone by an oncologic virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, evidence has arisen implicating both <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B and, even more so, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C viruses in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on this information, we surveyed the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B and C virus in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 334 newly-diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> patients (200 males, 134 females) and 1,014 (133 females, 881 males) healthy controls were randomly recruited from the university blood bank </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serologic evaluation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B and C viruses was conducted and confirmed using PCR analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B and/or C, controls, and subgroups of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> were compared using Pearson Chi-square analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002022'>lymphoid tumors</z:mp>, the seropositivity of HbsAg and/or anti-HCV was 8.7% (29/334), and among the controls 6.1% (49/802), however this difference did not achieve statistical significance (P = 0.23, OR: 1.36, 95% CI: 0.82-2.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found no significant gender- or age-related differences for either <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B or C seropositivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the seropositivity rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B, C, or both in either NHL or Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in the diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subgroups, the HbsAg seropositivity rate was significantly higher than that in the controls (P = 0.017, P = 0.048, respectively), as was the seropositivity rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C in those with diffuse B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> versus controls (P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We did not identify any significant difference in the combined prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B or C seropositivity between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, significant differences were revealed among certain patient subgroups versus the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These two viruses could play a role in the development of certain specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, larger epidemiological studies are necessary and should focus, particularly on specific patient subgroups </plain></SENT>
