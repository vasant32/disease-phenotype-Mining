<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the frequency of BCL-2/IgH rearrangement in peripheral blood cells of healthy Chinese individuals of Han nationality located in Zhejiang area and the low incidence of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nested-PCR and direct DNA sequencing were used to detect the Bcl-2/IgH rearrangement in peripheral blood cells of 196 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA sequences involved were then searched and aligned in NCBI database to confine the broken points in major breakpoint region and the IgH segments involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: First, in this sample the frequency of BCL-2/IgH translocation in Chinese individuals of Han nationality located in Zhejiang area is 9.66%, being much lower than that in North America and Europe countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Second, the breakpoints tend to fall into 3 clusters: 3055, 3116 and 3165 bp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Usage of J6 segment is most common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Third, There are different subclones of BCL-2/IgH rearrangements in the same individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The low frequency of BCL-2/IgH translocation in healthy Chinese individuals of Han nationality located in Zhejiang area may be one of the reasons for the difference in the incidence of FL between China and Western countries </plain></SENT>
