<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated mutations of the p53 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene in B-cell lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> with reference to oncogene rearrangements associated with specific chromosomal translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These included 15 patients with a BCL1/PRAD1 gene rearrangement and/or PRAD1 overexpression, 45 with a BCL2 rearrangement, 2 with a BCL3 rearrangement, 24 with a BCL6 rearrangement, and 6 with both BCL2 and BCL6 rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients lacked detectable oncogene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was isolated from involved tissues or leukemic cells obtained at diagnosis and/or at relapse, and established cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction-mediated single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing were performed to analyze abnormalities of the p53 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We detected p53 gene alterations in 18 of 128 patients, representing 21 of the total 151 materials analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the total of 66 patients with an oncogene rearrangement studied at diagnosis, only one had a mutation; however, 6 of 37 patients studied at relapse showed p53 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequential analysis revealed that the p53 mutation was closely associated with transformation from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, exclusively in BCL2-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of 13 mutations observed in oncogene rearrangement-positive cases and cell lines were transitions at CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the relationship between p53 mutations and clinical behavior in oncogene rearrangement-negative cases was variable; 5 patients including one with indolent follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were positive for p53 mutation at initial presentation, and 2 of the 5 showed prolonged disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that p53 alteration exhibits diverse functions in the development and progression of B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> related to the presence or absence of oncogene rearrangement, and that chemotherapy-related influences may be involved in the occurrence of progression-associated p53 mutations </plain></SENT>
