<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-3 has recently been shown to be overexpressed in several epithelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, with increased expression correlating with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behavior</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, there is no published literature evaluating <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-3 in lymphoid tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we immunohistochemically evaluated <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-3 expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid tissue and 141 lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Physiologically, <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-3 expression was restricted to germinal center B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> demonstrated the highest percentage of positive cases (26/26, 100%) often with bright staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was positive in 10 (83%) of 12 cases with moderate to bright staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was also positive in a high percentage of cases (12/15, 80%), the intensity was exclusively weak to moderate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although 22 (85%) of 26 of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were positive for <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-3, there was wide variability in staining intensity, which did not correlate with classification into activated B cell versus germinal center B origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By contrast, lower proportions (8%-20%) of other non-germinal center B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes were <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-3-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, although <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-3 expression is seemingly restricted to physiologic germinal center B cells, its expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of germinal center B origin is less robust </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, there does appear to be some association with the latter group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, which may prove to have diagnostic or therapeutic relevance as the biologic role of <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-3 is further elucidated </plain></SENT>
