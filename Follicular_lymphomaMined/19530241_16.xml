<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using Methylated CpG Island Amplification with Microarrays to study CpG Island DNA methylation in FL, we discovered widespread hypermethylation of homeobox genes and previously identified targets of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in cell lines and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e>, but not in benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BFH</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation for HOXA11, HOXD10, HOXB7, HOXC12, PAX6, LHX9, SFMBT2, EN2, and PAX7 was independently validated in the RL cell line and HOXA11, HOXD10, PAX6, and EN2 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">Bisulfite</z:chebi> Restriction Analysis (COBRA) also established DNA methylation for the previously identified PRC2 targets <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>, DES, GAD2, AQP5, GPR61, GRIA4, GJD2, and AMPH in FL but not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BFH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene expression analyses revealed 411 genes that were hypermethylated and transcriptionally repressed in RL, 74% of which were reactivated by the demethylating agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> (5-azaD) plus or minus the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46024">trichostatin A</z:chebi> (TSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty genes were also downregulated in primary FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that extensive hypermethylation in promoters of polycomb target genes is a characteristic of FL and that loss of expression of certain SUZ12 target genes could be functionally relevant for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
