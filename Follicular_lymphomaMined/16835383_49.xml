<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four hundred one patients were included from July 1994 to March 2001: 209 received 12 cycles of CHVP plus interferon alpha for 18 months (CHVP-I arm) and 192 received 4 cycles of CHOP followed by high-dose therapy (HDT) with total body irradiation and ASCT (CHOP-HDT arm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall response rates were similar in both groups (79% and 78% after induction chemotherapy, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred thirty-one of the 150 patients eligible for HDT underwent transplantation (87%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intent-to-treat analysis after a median follow-up of 7.5 years showed that there was no difference between the 2 arms for overall survival (P = .53) or event-free survival (P = .11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with a complete response at the end of the induction therapy had a statistically longer event-free survival and overall survival (P = .02 and &lt; .001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After long-term follow-up, our study showed that there was no statistically significant benefit in favor of first-line high-dose therapy in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High-dose therapy should be reserved for relapsing patients </plain></SENT>
