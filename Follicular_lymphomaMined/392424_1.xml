<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surface marker characteristics distinguished 2 subtypes of B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> was a monoclonal proliferation of B lymphocytes which produced spontaneous rosettes with mouse erythrocytes and had faintly immunofluorescent surface immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> also had their origin from B lymphocytes but in contrast, this subtype did not show receptors for mouse erythrocytes and their surface immunoglobulin was brightly staining and demonstrated "capping" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clonal origin of nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> could also be demonstrated on frozen sections stained for surface immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two cases of true histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The current information available on surface marker characteristics of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is reviewed </plain></SENT>
