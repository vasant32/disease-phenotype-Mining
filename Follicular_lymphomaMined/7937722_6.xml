<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Morphological clues may help to differentiate the benign from the malignant nodules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is sometimes difficult, if not impossible, to make this distinction, especially in patients with a known low-grade lymphocytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to determine whether staining bone marrow biopsies with an antibody to the bcl-2 protein might aid in making this differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a monoclonal antibody to bcl-2, we stained 26 bone marrows with benign lymphoid aggregates, 19 with a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 10 with small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, three with other non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and three with other miscellaneous hematopoietic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only one of the 26 benign lymphoid aggregates had moderate to intense staining with this antibody; in contrast, 79% of the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> stained positively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 10 small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> cases stained with moderate to intense intensity; the other two cases had weak staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No consistent pattern was seen with the other six lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on this data, we conclude that lack of staining of small lymphoid aggregates within the bone marrow with the antibody to the bcl-2 protein is suggestive of a benign aggregate, whereas moderate to strong staining intensity is most consistent with a malignant process </plain></SENT>
