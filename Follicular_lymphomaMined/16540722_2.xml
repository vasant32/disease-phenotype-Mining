<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the utility of a panel of paraffin-reactive antibodies in differentiating these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using clinical data and morphologic criteria, 134 cases of small B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were grouped as those with (1) one strongly suggested diagnosis, (2) differential diagnosis between two types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and (3) small B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> without hints for further subclassification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With a panel of antibodies including CD5, CD10, CD23, CD43, bcl-2, and cyclin D1, most but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases could be precisely categorized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This panel confirmed the diagnosis in 96.5% of the cases from group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group 2 it confirmed one of the two diagnoses in 81.5% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group 3 it established a definitive diagnosis in 55% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups were considered, a correct diagnosis could be established for 88.1% of cases; for 6.7% of them the authors remained with two possible diagnosis, and the broad "small B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>" was the only diagnosis for 5.2% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD10 separated most follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> from other small B-cell lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD23 separated small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cyclin D1 separated mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present study selected CD10, CD23, and cyclin D1 as a minimal panel for the classification of small B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, yielding a final diagnosis in 88.1% of the cases </plain></SENT>
