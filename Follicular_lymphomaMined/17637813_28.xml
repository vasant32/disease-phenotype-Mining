<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 375 patients (54%) developed recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 10-year progression-free survival (PFS) being 31% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, younger age (P=0.003) and HDT in first complete remission (CR1) (P&lt;0.001) correlated with longer PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 10.3 years, 330 patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten-year overall survival (OS) from HDT was 52% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Shorter OS was associated on multivariate analysis with older age (P&lt;0.001), chemoresistant disease (P&lt;0.001), BM+PBPC as source of stem cells (P=0.007) and TBI-containing regimens (P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine patients developed secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), in 34 cases having received TBI as the conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, older age (P&lt;0.001), refractory disease (P&lt;0.001) and TBI (P=0.04) were associated with a higher NRM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This long follow-up study shows a plateau in the PFS curve, suggesting that a selected group of patients might be cured with HDT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the downside, TBI-containing regimens are associated with a negative impact on survival </plain></SENT>
