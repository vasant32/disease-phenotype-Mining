<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The presence of neoplastic (light chain restricted) B-cell follicles in low-grade B-cell gastrointestinal (GI) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) has been explained on the basis of specific colonization of reactive follicles by centrocyte-like (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="3478">CCL</z:chebi>) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Low-grade B-cell thyroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> have been included in the category of MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but the frequent presence of a follicular pattern in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> has contributed to the view that they are follicle center cell (FCC) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have reviewed the histology and investigated the phenotype and genotype of nine cases of primary low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the thyroid, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were distinguished by a predominantly follicular pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases also demonstrated features of MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, including <z:chebi fb="15" ids="3478">CCL</z:chebi> cells and lymphoepithelial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The appearances and immunohistology of the follicles were those of follicular colonization as described in GI MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> rather than FCC follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The predominant pattern of follicular colonization was replacement of the follicle center by slightly enlarged <z:chebi fb="15" ids="3478">CCL</z:chebi> cells that showed a strikingly high proliferation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No evidence of the t(14;18) translocation was found in any case, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on DNA extracted from fresh (n = 1) or paraffin-embedded (n = 9) tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings argue against a FCC lineage for primary thyroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and support their inclusion in the MALT category </plain></SENT>
