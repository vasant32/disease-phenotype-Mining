<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TWelve cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> B-lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, 18 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e>/centrocytic follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 17 cases of lymphoplasmacytic/lymphoplasmacytoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, as diagnosed according to Kiel classification, were subjected to enzyme assay and isoelectric focusing of acid esterase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Enzyme values revealed no characteristic distribution among the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The isoenzyme pattern, specific to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human B-lymphocytes, were regularly detectable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results document the B-cell origin of the analyzed subsets of B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, although distinctive acid esterase patterns were lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of three anodal isoenzymes in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> B-lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, hardly detectable in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> entities, were interpreted as the expression of a clonal proliferation, arrested at a certain differentiation stage of B-cells common for the majority of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hence, further evidence is provided supporting the view that the studied entities represent B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> at different stages of differentiation expressing a variety of different markers </plain></SENT>
