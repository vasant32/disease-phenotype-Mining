<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance and prognostic value of CD10 in de novo diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively studied 19 men and 9 women based on the following criteria: (1) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> with no evidence of concomitant or antecedent follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; (2) available flow cytometric immunophenotyping data, including CD10 status; (3) older than 15 years; (4) specific exclusion of high-grade, Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; and (5) exclusion of primary cutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When available, clinical data at diagnosis, including components of the international prognostic index, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven cases were CD10+, and 17 were CD10- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the CD10+ and CD10- groups in age, sex, stage, performance status, extranodal involvement, or serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase levels at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in the 26 cases for which follow-up data were available, the CD10+ group displayed a shorter overall survival than the CD10- group (8 vs 30 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the clinical findings at diagnosis are similar in CD10+ and CD10- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, CD10 expression is associated with shortened overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our data suggest CD10 expression may have prognostic importance in adults with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
