<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To overcome this problem, we decided to validate a quantification method of t(14;18)-bearing cells and test it in t(14;18)-bearing follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We designed a competitive PCR method to quantify t(14;18)-bearing cells in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, we controlled overall reliability (specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility, precision and accuracy); then we used our method to study 16 peripheral blood samples collected in 8 patients with t(14;18)-bearing FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were considerable variations in the number of circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell (CTC) in FL patients, ranging from zero to 17,813 cells/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients who were sampled before and after treatment and who attained complete remission (CR), a significant decrease in the number of CTC was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients with detectable CTC during CR, relapse occurred 4 to 11 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 3 patients with no detectable CTC, 2 remain in CR 35 and 95 months later, but one relapsed 11 months after sample collection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These preliminary results suggest that quantification of CTC may be worthwhile in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It may improve our ability to predict relapse occurrence, but also may help in understanding this peculiar disease </plain></SENT>
