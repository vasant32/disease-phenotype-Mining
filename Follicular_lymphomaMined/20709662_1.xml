<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>R-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16108">DHAP</z:chebi> combines rituximab with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We substituted <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> to avoid nephrotoxicity and retrospectively analyzed a large series of 91 patients with refractory/relapsed B-cell NHL to evaluate toxicities, response rates (RRs), and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median age at R-DHAX (rituximab/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>) treatment was 60 years (range, 28-82 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>Renal insufficiency</z:hpo> was present in 18 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most frequent histologic subtypes were diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 42) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients (19%) were naive to rituximab at time of R-DHAX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Grade III/IV toxicities were mainly hematologic, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (n = 9), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (n = 44), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (n = 47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Grade I/II neurologic toxicities, sensitive or motor, were observed, and these were mainly transient except for 3 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235025" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">motor neuropathy</z:e> associated with previous exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither renal toxicities nor degradation of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall RR was 75%, with a complete RR of 57%, with no statistical difference between patients previously treated with rituximab versus without rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 23 months, 2-year probability rates of overall survival and progression-free survival were 75% and 43%, respectively, with a significant difference between patients treated with HDT/ASCT and patients not eligible for HDT/ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: R-DHAX is an efficient regimen in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell NHL even in elderly patients if hematologic toxicities are closely managed </plain></SENT>
