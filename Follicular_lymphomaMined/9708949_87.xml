<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the clinical characteristics of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and the relative frequency in the Republic of Korea of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> belonging to the newly described REAL (revised European-American <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) classification categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Hematolymphoreticular Study Group of the Korean Society of Pathologists conducted a consensus-based morphologic review of a nationwide collection of 1548 malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>), diagnosed at 23 institutes over a recent 2-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Slides stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin or other immunohistochemical stains were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were classified according to the histologic criteria proposed by the International <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Study Group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical data, including age, gender, and site of disease involvement, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Republic of Korea had lower rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> and follicle center <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and higher rates of extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and angiocentric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> compared with Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent subtypes of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) were diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, extranodal marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, unspecified type, and angiocentric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, in decreasing order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with a previous nationwide study, the rates for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and NHL involving the stomach, orbit, and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system were increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of T-cell NHL in the current study was much lower than that reported in a previous study for the Republic of Korea and was also lower than that reported for other Far East countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>, the relative frequency of nodular <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> subtype was higher compared with that in the previous study, and lymphocyte predominance and lymphocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> were lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence rates for various subtypes of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the Republic of Korea are distinct from those in Western countries and similar in many ways to those in other countries in the Far East </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared with other Far East countries, the Republic of Korea has a higher rate of extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, rare adult T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and a relatively low rate of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It appears that over time there have been changes in the relative rates for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, and gastric and orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The authors attribute these changes primarily to refined criteria for diagnosing new clinicopathologic entities </plain></SENT>
