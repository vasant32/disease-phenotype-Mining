<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In situ follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is usually an incidental finding in otherwise reactive lymph node [1–3] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it may be associated with overt FL, or with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> other than FL or with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>,in other sites or, less commonly, in the same lymph node [2,4–8] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we describe two cases of in situ FL, one with concurrent overt FL(Case 1), and one with concurrent peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e>),NOS (Case 2) in the same lymph node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction for B and T-cell clonality, and double-staining chromogenic in situ hybridization for BCL2 translocation were performed.In both cases, the in situ FL foci were characterized by strong expression of BCL2 and CD10 in the germinal center B cells of the affected follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case 1 showed the concurrence of an overt B-cell FL with IgH@ rearrangement and expression of B-cell markers, but not BCL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Case 2 demonstrated the concurrence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e>, NOS with TCRG@ rearrangement and expression of T-cell markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion,the association of in situ FL with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e> expands the spectrum of lymphoproliferations that may coexist with in situ FL and suggests that in situ FL may not behave like a simple precursor for overt FL </plain></SENT>
