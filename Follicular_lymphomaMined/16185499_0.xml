<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 83 gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases were analyzed retrospectively in accordance to the criteria of the new World Health Organization classification for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic diseases</z:e> of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The correlations between clinicopathological features, therapeutic measures and survival were discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age of patients ranged from 25 to 77, with a median of 52 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of males were similar to that of females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no specific symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common symptoms were stomach ache (60 cases, 72%) or discomfort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The duration of symptoms was often long and with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastric diseases</z:e> (21 cases, 25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>13 cases had multiple lesions in the gastrointestinal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>51 cases (61%) were accompanied by lymph node involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>According to the new World Health Organization classification for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic diseases</z:e> of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues, 57 cases were extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)-type (MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), 23 were diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> accompanying MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 2 were diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 1 was follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases, 31 were stage I E, 38 stage II E, 8 stage III E and 6 stage IV by the Ann Arbor staging system (1972) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The total 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 77.8% and 70.1% respectively, with the mean survival time of 146 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The 5-year and 10-year survival rates of MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were 77.4% and 72.3%, the 5-year and 10-year survival rates of diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> accompanying MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were 81.8% and 68.2%, the 5-year survival rate of diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was 50.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are no specific symptoms in gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of MALT-type is the main histopathological type of gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, often accompanied by multiple mucosa involvement and also often accompanied by a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastric disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The lesion is usually localized for a long time, with a very good prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Survival rate has a significant correlation with lymph node involvement and clinical stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>No correlations were found between the survival rates with age, gender, B symptoms, invasive depth of the wall of stomach, the size and range of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> or different therapeutic measures </plain></SENT>
