<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to quantify cytological features and to assess objective descriptions, a morphometric analysis was performed on 83 peripheral blood smears of B-cells disorders (n = 77) and healthy donors (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using standardized May-Grunwald Giemsa staining, standardized image acquisition system and well defined microscopic fields, we have analyzed lymphoid cells, measuring morphometric and color parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By combining seven relevant morphometric criteria (the nuclear shape, the cellular shape and area, the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33252">nucleo</z:chebi>-cytoplasmic ratio, the nuclear red/blue ratio, the cytoplasmic green/blue ratio and the proportion of cells with nucleolus), we have established a score that could range from a minimum of -3 (large B-CLL type) to a maximum of +8 (large <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> type): negative scores corresponds to different types of B-CLL (n = 30), including "atypical B-CLL" (n = 6), the score zero correspond to healthy donors (n = 6) used as baseline, the positive score values correspond to +1 for Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 2), +3 for Splenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> with Villous Lymphocytes (n = 12), +4 for Hairy Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 7), for Hairy Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo>-variant (n = 2), +6 for B-prolymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 6) and +7 and +8 for most Mantle Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Testing T-cell disorders samples (n = 10) using the same protocol, the profile is different and cannot be confused with B-cell diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our scoring system indicates that measurement of some common morphologic features in standardized conditions provides objective criteria to characterize those diseases and might be helpful for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
