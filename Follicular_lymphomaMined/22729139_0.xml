<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to describe the value of surveillance CT in detection of disease relapse in patients with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade 3 (FL3) and to evaluate whether relapse detected by different methods influenced outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective review of consecutive 341 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> or FL3 diagnosed between 2003 and 2009 in complete response (CR) or unconfirmed CR, 113 patients experienced relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that routine surveillance CT detected asymptomatic relapse in 25 patients (22.1%; group 1), including 22 of 100 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and three of 13 with FL3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first presentation of relapse of the other 88 patients (group 2) included patient-reported symptoms (60.2%), physical examination (13.3%), or abnormal laboratory data (4.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For 72 patients received chemotherapy after relapse, the overall survival after relapse was not different between groups 1 and 2 (p = 0.569) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of our study suggested that routine surveillance CT only has a limited role in the early detection of relapse and the relapse detected by surveillance CT or not has no impact on survival after relapse for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> or FL3 </plain></SENT>
