<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper we review recent clinical trials investigating the addition of rituximab to standard chemotherapy regimens for treatment of patients with diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report focuses upon treatment efficacy, quality of life, and safety of rituximab or rituximab-containing regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More uniquely, we review economic aspects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treatments, including the cost of standard chemotherapy regimens with or without rituximab, cost effectiveness of rituximab in both induction and maintenance treatment, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>'s impacts on patient's productivity and their caregivers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that adding rituximab to standard chemotherapy treatment for patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is safe and cost-effective in numerous settings during both induction and maintenance therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite extensive review of the literature, many important questions have yet to be answered in the rituximab era and these represent important directions for future study </plain></SENT>
