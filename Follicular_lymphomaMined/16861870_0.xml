<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The treatment and prognosis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is dependant on the grade of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the World Health Organization classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, grading of FL into low grade (1 and 2) and high grade (3) is recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Grading of FL is possible in excision biopsy; histological grading is subjective and inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Grading is extremely difficult in needle core biopsies and fine needle aspirates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We attempted to grade FL using flow cytometry (FCM) and CD19/ forward scatter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cases of FL seen in our institution and submitted for FCM were evaluated for the percentage of cells detected beyond the 500-channel mark (on a 1024 scale) on a CD19/forward scatter dot plot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that these cells most likely represent centroblasts and their percentage would reflect the grade of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological grading of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> on the open biopsies constituted the reference for FL grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-six cases of FL, including 22 males and 14 females, ranging in age from 19 to 92 years (median, 42 years), were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 17 cases of low grade (grade 1; n=10 and grade 2; n=7) and 19 cases of high grade (grade 3) FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The percentage of cells identified beyond the 500-channel mark on CD19/forward scatter dot plot ranged from 0.12% to 12.55% (median, 4.9%) in low grade (grade 1 and 2) whereas the percentage of those cells in high grade FL ranged from 6.22% to 51.95% (median, 21%; P=0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that using a CD19/forward scatter dot plot can help identify centroblasts in FL making grading possible on FCM, especially in small biopsies and fine needle aspirates </plain></SENT>
