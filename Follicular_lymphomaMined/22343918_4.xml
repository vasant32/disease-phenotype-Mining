<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The FOXO transcription factors control proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in different cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their activity is regulated by posttranslational modifications, mainly by the PI3K-PKB pathway, which controls nuclear export and degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show that FOXO1 is highly expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> germinal center B cells as well as in non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in 31 of 32 classical Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (cHL) cases, Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells were FOXO1 negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neoplastic cells of nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were negative in 14 of 20 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FOXO1 was down-regulated in cHL cell lines, whereas it was expressed in non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines at levels comparable with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ectopic expression of a constitutively active FOXO1 induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in cHL cell lines and blocked proliferation, accompanied with cell-cycle arrest in the G(0)/G(1) phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that, in cHL cell lines, FOXO1 is inactivated by multiple mechanisms, including constitutive activation of AKT/PKB and MAPK/ERK kinases and up-regulation of microRNAs miR-96, miR-182, and miR-183 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that FOXO1 repression contributes to cHL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
