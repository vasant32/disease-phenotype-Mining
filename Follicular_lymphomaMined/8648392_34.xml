<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To answer the question whether t(14;18)-positive cells can be detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the peripheral blood of healthy blood donors and patients with nonmalignant diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) from healthy donors (n = 36) and patients with nonmalignant diseases (n = 21) were examined by two-step PCR for the detection of t(14;18)-positive cells with a breakpoint within the major breakpoint region (MBR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Approximate numbers of t(14;18)-positive cells were determined using limiting dilution assays, as well as the stochastic multiple-tube approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We were able to detect t(14;18)-positive cells in PBMNC of approximately 50% of healthy donors and patients with nonmalignant diseases if DNA amounts up to 10 microg were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with 17 t(14;18)-positive patients being in complete remission after radiotherapy for low-stage malignant follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the majority of 26 healthy donors were found to have significantly lower numbers of t(14;18)-positive cells circulating in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the case of six healthy donors, more than one t(14;18) DNA fragment based on size and nucleotide sequence analysis was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one healthy individual, four different t(14;18)-positive cell clones were found in nine samples found over 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The occurrence of the t(14;18) translocation is not restricted to follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In healthy donors, long-lived t(14;18)-positive cells can be detected by PCR if the sensitivity is high enough </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on nucleotide sequence analysis, the t(14;18) DNA fragments detected in healthy donors cannot be distinguished from those found in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
