<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate genomic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, 50 biopsies of 21 patients with B-LPD of different histogenetic origin were studied for changes in the immunoglobulin gene structure during follow-up study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ig-heavy chain (IgH) gene alterations were analyzed by Southern blotting using a panel of eight endonucleases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ig-light chain (IgL) genes and the translocation of the bc 1-2 gene involved in t(14;18) were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In seven of nine follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, most alterations suggested mutations in the IgH genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conservation of most restriction sites and of the t(14; 18) breakpoint confirmed the monoclonal origin in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, in two of three diffuse follicle center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (CLL) and in each of four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytomas</z:e>, IgH alterations were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, clonal changes were absent in three centrocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and two cases of CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In two follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with bitypic IgL expression, a common origin with subsequent divergence of the two constituents, rather than true biclonality, was indicated by the Ig gene structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No relation was found between the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> and histologic signs of progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that somatic hypermutation in IgH genes is related to the histogenesis of the B-LPD and reflect the <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of their benign counterparts in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cell development </plain></SENT>
