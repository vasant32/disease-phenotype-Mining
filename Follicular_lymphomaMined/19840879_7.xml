<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Industrial pollution has been suspected as a cause of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), based on associations with chemical exposures in occupational studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a case-control study of NHL in four SEER regions of the United States, in which residential locations of 864 cases and 684 controls during the 10 years before recruitment were used to characterize proximity to industrial facilities reporting chemical releases to the Environmental Protection Agency's Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each of 15 types of industry (by 2-digit SIC code), we evaluated the risk of NHL associated with having lived within 2 miles of a facility, the distance to the nearest facility (miles categories of &lt; or =0.5, &gt;0.5-1.0, &gt;1.0-2.0, &gt;2 [referent]), and the duration of residence within 2miles (years categories of 10, 1-9, 0 [referent]), using logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased risk of NHL was observed in relation to lumber and wood products facilities (SIC 24) for the shortest distance of residential proximity (&lt; or =0.5 mile: odds ratio [OR]=2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.4-11.8) or the longest duration (10 years: OR=1.9, 95% CI: 0.8-4.8); the association with lumber facilities was more apparent for diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (lived within 2 miles: OR=1.7, 95% CI: 1.0-3.0) than for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR=1.1, 95% CI: 0.5-2.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also observed elevated ORs for the chemical (SIC 28, 10 years: OR=1.5, 95% CI: 1.1-2.0), petroleum (SIC 29, 10 years: OR=1.9, 95% CI: 1.0-3.6), rubber/miscellaneous plastics products (SIC 30, &lt; or =0.5mile: OR=2.7, 95% CI: 1.0-7.4), and primary metal (SIC 33, lived within 2miles: OR=1.3, 95% CI: 1.0-1.6) industries; however, patterns of risk were inconsistent between distance and duration metrics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study does not provide strong evidence that living near manufacturing industries increases NHL risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, future studies designed to include greater numbers of persons living near specific types of industries, along with fate-transport modeling of chemical releases, would be informative </plain></SENT>
