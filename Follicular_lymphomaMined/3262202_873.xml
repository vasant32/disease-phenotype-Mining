<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By analogy with the translocated c-myc oncogene in other B-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598798" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoid tumours</z:e> bcl-2 is a candidate oncogene, but no biological effects of bcl-2 have yet been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test whether bcl-2 influences the growth of haematopoietic cells, either alone or together with a deregulated c-myc gene, we have introduced a human bcl-2 complementary DNA using a retroviral vector into bone marrow cells from either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or E mu-myc transgenic mice, in which B-lineage cells constitutively express the c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 cooperated with c-myc to promote proliferation of B-cell precursors, some of which became tumorigenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine how bcl-2 expression impinges on growth factor requirements, the gene was introduced into a lymphoid and a myeloid cell line that require interleukin 3 (IL-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the absence of IL-3, bcl-2 promoted the survival of the infected cells but they persisted in a G0 state, rather than proliferating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results argue that bcl-2 provided a distinct survival signal to the cell and may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> by allowing a clone to persist until other oncogenes, such as c-myc, become activated </plain></SENT>
