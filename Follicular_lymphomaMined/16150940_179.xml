<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Because the causes of most lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> remain unknown, comparison of incidence patterns by disease subtype may provide critical clues for future etiologic investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore conducted a comprehensive assessment of 114,548 lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> diagnosed during 1992-2001 in 12 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries according to the internationally recognized World Health Organization (WHO) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> classification introduced in 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cases coded in International Classification of Diseases for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo>, Second Edition (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-O-2), were converted to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-O-3 for WHO subtype assignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age-specific and age-adjusted rates were compared by sex and race (white, black, Asian) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age-adjusted trends in incidence were estimated by sex and race using weighted least squares log-linear regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diverse incidence patterns and trends were observed by lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> subtype and population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the elderly (75 years or older), rates of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> increased 1.4% and 1.8% per year, respectively, whereas rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e>) declined 2.1% per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although whites bear the highest incidence burden for most lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> subtypes, most notably for hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, black predominance was observed for plasma cell and T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Asians have considerably lower rates than whites and blacks for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e> and Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the striking differences in incidence patterns by histologic subtype strongly suggest that there is etiologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> among lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and support the pursuit of epidemiologic analysis by subtype </plain></SENT>
