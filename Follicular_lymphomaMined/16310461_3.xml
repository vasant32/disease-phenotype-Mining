<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To study BCL10 expression in ocular adnexal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the US population and its association with clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Institutional, retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed with antibody against BCL10 on two tissue microarray blocks that were constructed with paraffin-embedded tissues from the same cohort of 48 patients with ocular adnexal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main outcomes that were measured include extraorbital involvement, recurrence rate, and time to recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median length of the follow-up period was 40 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Aberrant BCL10 expression (nuclear [moderate intensity] and cytoplasmic [weak to moderate intensity] staining) was observed in 10 of 33 cases (30.3%) of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, in 4 of 10 cases (40%) of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (grade 1, 9 cases; grade 2, 1 case), in 0 of 2 cases of diffused large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, in 0 of 1 case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in 1 of 1 case (100%) of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in clinical parameters at examination (ie, average age, gender, site of occurrence, laterality, extraorbital involvement at diagnosis), recurrence rate, and time to recurrence for patients (MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) with or without aberrant nuclear BCL10 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Aberrant BCL10 expression can occur in other types of ocular adnexal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> besides MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ocular adnexal MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> may have slightly lower frequency of aberrant BCL10 expression than gastric/pulmonary MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that have been reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, aberrant BCL10 nuclear expression in ocular adnexal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> does not seem to correlate with clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies that include a larger number of cases and longer follow-up period are needed to confirm our observation </plain></SENT>
