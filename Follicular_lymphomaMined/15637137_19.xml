<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, the amount of BCL2/IgH(+) cells in the BM was low (1 BCL2/IgH(+) cell in 1000-100 000 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells) in 43% of patients, intermediate (1 in 100-1000) in 34%, and high (&gt; 1 in 100) in 23% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 2 log decrease of BCL2/IgH(+) cells was achieved after CHOP and an additional 2 log reduction following rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, a low level of BCL2/IgH(+) cells in the BM at diagnosis was the best predictor for the achievement of a complete clinical and molecular response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 5 years, the event-free survival rates of patients with a low/intermediate or high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> infiltration in the BM were 59% and 32%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The freedom from recurrence of patients who achieved a molecular response in the BM, no matter whether after CHOP alone or CHOP and rituximab, was 64% as compared to 32% for patients who did not (P &lt; .006) </plain></SENT>
