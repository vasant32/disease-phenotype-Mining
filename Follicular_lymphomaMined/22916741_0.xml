<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To help clarify this issue, PMH and NHL incidence was examined in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Prevention Study-II Nutrition Cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between 1992 and 2007, 616 cases of NHL were identified among 67 980 postmenopausal women who were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-free at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PMH use was updated during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using extended Cox regression, we observed a statistically significant 29% higher risk of NHL for ever unopposed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> use compared to never use, which was restricted to follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (current <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> compared to never use, hazard ratio [HR] = 2.25, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17-4.33) and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, HR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.13-3.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no association between current <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestin</z:chebi> (E + P) use and NHL incidence overall, but a suggested positive association between current E + P use and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, as well as former E + P use and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that postmenopausal hormones might play a role in NHL etiology, particularly for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
