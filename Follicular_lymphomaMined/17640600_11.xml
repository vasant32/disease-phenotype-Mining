<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored our experience in ASCT for FL among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients treated over a 15-year period from diagnosis through their entire treatment history including relapse post ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who underwent an unpurged ASCT for relapsed, advanced FL between June 1990 and December 2000 were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After salvage therapy they received melphalan/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>/total body irradiation, BCNU, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, melphalan (BEAM), or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> BCNU <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (CBV) as conditioning for the ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred thirty-eight patients with a median age of 48 years and a median follow-up of 7.6 years were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority were of the subtype grade 1, nontransformed (FL-NT), having had 1 prior chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of the FL-NT at 10 years were 46% and 57%, respectively, and at 5 years for the transformed (FL-T) were 25% and 56%, respectively, of which only the PFS was significantly different (P=.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median OS from diagnosis was 16 years for the FL-NT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ASCT positively altered the trend of shorter remissions with subsequent chemotherapies, and there was no difference in OS between those who had 1, 2, or &gt;2 chemotherapies prior to ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Salvage therapy for relapse post ASCT was effective (OS&gt;1 year) in a third of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Unpurged ASCT is an effective tool in the treatment of relapsed, aggressive FL-NT and FL-T, is superior to retreatment with standard chemotherapy, is effective at various stages of treatment, is likely to have a beneficial influence on the natural history of this disease, and the disease is amenable to salvage therapy post-ASCT relapse </plain></SENT>
