<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Autologous bone marrow transplantation is increasingly being used in the management of several types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and to avoid reintroduction of malignant cells, bone marrow purging is often performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In such cases, sensitive quantitation methods are needed both to assess the efficacy of the purging and for surveillance of patients in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has the necessary sensitivity for this application, but it requires that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells can be recognized by a defined genetic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, PCR is in principle a qualitative technique and must be modified for quantitative purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In follicular non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the translocation t(14;18) (q32;q21) is common and is used here for model experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A PCR-based method for the quantitation of translocation-positive cells was developed on the basis of coamplification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific target molecules with competitor molecules of known concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gel electrophoresis was substituted by a colorimetric quantitation system to cope with patient PCR products of the same size as the competitor product and ease automation of the method at a later stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cell line Karpas 422, which contains the t(14;18) (q32;21) translocation, was used to validate the method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The method was used to assess the efficacy of a patient bone marrow purging where the initial infiltration levels were too low for traditional detection systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A reproducible and near linear response was obtained between 70 pg and 200 ng K422 DNA, equivalent to 10 K422 cells and 30,000 K422 cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow infiltration in one patient was 0.6 to 0.7% before malignant cell removal and 3 to 7 x 10(-4) after removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The corresponding figures for the other patient were 2% and 3 to 7 x 10(-4), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The method presented has a sufficient dynamic range for applications like evaluation of bone marrow purging or monitoring of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Adaptation of this method to other translocations is discussed </plain></SENT>
