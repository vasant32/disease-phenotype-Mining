<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The clinicopathologic and molecular features of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) in Taiwan have not been well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a retrospective study including history review, immunohistochemistry, and molecular study for the major breakpoint region (MBR) of t(14;18) and correlated these findings with survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-five FLs were identified, with a male to female ratio of 1.9:1 and a median age of 63 years (mean, 60 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty cases (92%) were nodal, 4 (6%) were extranodal, and 1 (2%) was indeterminate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median ages of the nodal and extranodal cases were 63 years and 44 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disease staging in 59 patients included 15 patients (25%) with stage I disease, 14 (24%) with stage II, 20 (34%) with stage III, and 10 (17%) with stage IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-four patients received chemotherapy, 2 patients received chemotherapy with palliative radiation therapy, and 13 patients received supportive treatment/observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 5-year survival rate was 52.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cases were classified as grades 1 (n = 27; 42%), 2 (n = 22; 34%), 3A (n = 13; 20%), and 3B (n = 3; 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty cases (31%) were positive for MBR, including 19 of 57 (33%) nodal cases and 1 of 4 (25%) primary extanodal FLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with low-stage disease (stages I/II) had a better survival rate than patients with high-stage disease (III/IV; log-rank test, P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the largest series of Taiwanese FLs with immunophenotypes and MBR detection rates similar to those of the West </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Disease stage was statistically significant with regard to survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although the number of extranodal FLs cases was small, the patients were younger, their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> had lower CD10 expression, and they had more favorable survival rates than patients with nodal disease </plain></SENT>
