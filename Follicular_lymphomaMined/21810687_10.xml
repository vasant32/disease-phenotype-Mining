<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received five 35-day cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi>, bendamustine, and rituximab: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> administered intravenously (IV) at a dose of 1.6 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, cycles one to five; bendamustine 50, 70, or 90 mg/m(2) IV over a 60-minute infusion on days 1 and 2, cycles one to five; and rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycle one and day 1 of subsequent cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were assessed using the International Workshop Response Criteria, with the primary end point of 60% complete response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the dose-escalation phase, the maximum-tolerated dose for bendamustine was not reached; the 90 mg/m(2) dose level was expanded for the efficacy assessment, and a total of 63 patients received bendamustine 90 mg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these 63 patients, the overall response rate was 88% (including 53% complete response) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median duration of response was 11.7 months (95% CI, 9.2 to 13.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival was 14.9 months (95% CI, 11.1 to 23.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Toxicities were manageable; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> was the main toxicity (25% and 14% of patients experienced grade 3 to 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and grade 3 to 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transient grade 3 to 4 neuropathy occurred in 11% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi>, bendamustine, and rituximab is highly active in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who have received previous treatment </plain></SENT>
