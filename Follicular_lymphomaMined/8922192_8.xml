<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This phase II multi-institutional trial was designed to assess response and toxicity of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDA</z:e>) in patients with previously untreated follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of detecting cells carrying the t(14;18) translocation (bcl-2/JH rearrangement) in peripheral blood and bone marrow by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) before, during and after treatment was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between May 1993 and October 1995, 37 patients were accrued: male/female: 15/22, median age 51 years (range: 20-78), stage III/IV: 9/28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received a total 2-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDA</z:e> dose of 0.7 mg/kg as continuous s.c. or i.v. infusions over 7 days, every 28 days for a maximum of 5 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 165 cycles were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 25 patients, blood and bone marrow before, during and after treatment were available for PCR analysis of the bcl-2/JH rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 37 patients were evaluable for response and toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 84% (95% confidence interval, 68%-94%) with 14% CR (n = 5) and 70% PR (n = 26) and a median time to treatment failure of 15.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>bcl-2/JH rearrangement in peripheral blood and/or bone marrow was found in 10/25 of patients (40%) before treatment and 5 of these became repeatedly negative after 2-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDA</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no apparent association between bcl-2/ JH result and response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 11 patients, 2-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDA</z:e> was stopped because of progressive disease (n = 4), myelotoxicity (grade 2-3, n = 4), and other causes (n = 3, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorder</z:e>, and patient's decision) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four patients (11%) suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (grade 2-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 6 patients, persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> of 7.5 months (range: 3-21) occurred after completion of the 5 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: 2-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDA</z:e> is active in untreated follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, but time to treatment failure suggests no advantage compared with standard treatment and toxicity on haematopoietic stem cells appears to be more pronounced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Molecular remission is induced in a considerable proportion of patients with disappearance of the bcl-2/JH rearrangement, and its possible significance as a predictive factor for quality of response and relapse warrants further study </plain></SENT>
