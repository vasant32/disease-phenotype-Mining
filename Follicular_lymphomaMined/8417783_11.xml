<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these 37 patients, 22 were positive either at the DNA or <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> level (8 with active disease and 14 in CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among these positive patients, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was more often negative for patients in CR (9 of 14 [64%]) than for patients with active disease (2 of 8 [25%]; Fisher's exact test, P = .09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 14 patients in CR with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e>, 2 of 5 with <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> positivity relapsed, whereas 1 of 9 with <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> negativity and DNA positivity relapsed with a median follow-up after sample collection of 8 months (range, 4 to 18 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous analysis of the bcl-2/IgH gene at the DNA and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> level showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> patterns of PCR positivity in regards to the evaluation of the biologic activity of the t(14;18)-carrying cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A larger study and long-term follow-up will help in determining whether the expression patterns in turn reflect the functional status of disease activity in FL patients </plain></SENT>
