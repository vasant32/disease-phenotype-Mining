<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Persistent polyclonal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo> (PPBL) is a rare entity, presenting especially in adult smoker women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by an increase of serum IgM, DR7-HLA haplotype, cytogenetic abnormalities and multiple IgH/BCL-2 rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, it has not been elucidated whether this is a benign or premalignant disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the PPBL characteristics with especial attention to its evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five PPBL patients from 5 hospitals in Catalonia were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A simultaneous morphologic review of the blood smears was performed by members of the GCCH in a 16 multiple-observer optic microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical and biological data were also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PPBL presents in the majority of cases with persistent polyclonal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo> and affects primarily smoker women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The morphologic hallmark, in absence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, is the presence of activated lymphocytes with bilobulated and/or cleaved nuclei, and nuclear pockets in the ultrastructural study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased serum IgM, HLA-DR7 haplotype, chromosomal abnormalities such as i(3)(q10) and multiple IgH/BCL-2 rearrangements were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four out of 35 patients are alive after a median follow up of 70.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient died because of <z:mp ids='MP_0002027'>lung adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and another developed a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> without relation to PPBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PPBL has an asymptomatic and stable evolution, although it frequently presents genetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It remains unknown whether it is a premalignant entity, similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278494" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MGUS">monoclonal gammopathies of unknown significance</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Hence, accurate cytologic diagnosis and follow-up are essential </plain></SENT>
