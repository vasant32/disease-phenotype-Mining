<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: For decades, non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) incidence has been increasing worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NHL risk is strongly increased among HIV-infected people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our understanding of trends in NHL incidence has been hampered by difficulties in separating HIV-infected NHL cases from general population rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: NHL incidence data during 1992-2009 were derived from 10 U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SEER <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries with information on HIV status at NHL diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CDC estimated the number of people living with HIV in the registry areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of NHL cases with HIV and NHL rates in the total and the HIV-uninfected populations were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Time trends were assessed with Joinpoint analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 115,643 NHL cases diagnosed during 1992-2009, 5.9% were HIV-infected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The proportions of NHL cases with HIV were highest for diffuse large B-cell (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>; 7.8%), Burkitt (26.9%), and peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (3.2%) with low proportions (≤1.1%) in the other subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NHL rates in the total population increased 0.3% per year during 1992-2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, rates of NHL in HIV-uninfected people increased 1.4% per year during 1992-2003, before becoming stable through 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Similar trends were observed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in HIV-uninfected people; rates increased 2.7% per year until 2003 and 1.7% per year until 2005, respectively, before stabilizing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NHL incidence rates in the United States have plateaued over the last 5-10 years, independent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: Although the causes of the long-term increase in NHL incidence rates in the United States remain unknown, general population rates of NHL have stabilized since the early 2000s, independent of HIV </plain></SENT>
