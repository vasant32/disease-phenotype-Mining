<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several steps in the clinical evolution of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> are associated with a variety of recurrent chromosomal defects that could prove essential to the understanding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found 15 types of nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities in a study of 71 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; 10 of the types appeared to influence the histopathological findings, clinical course, or response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A translocation, t(14;18), observed in 85 percent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients appeared to be the main determinant of a follicular pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with a t(14;18) as a single defect had the histologic features of follicular small cleaved-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most did not require treatment for one to four years, because their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> had an initial indolent course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients with follicular small cleaved-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with t(14;18) and deletion 13q32 acquired the hematologic features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and had an acceleration of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A deletion 6q together with a complete or partial <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 7 or <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 12 (or both) was associated with the clinically more aggressive follicular mixed small- and large-cell or large-cell histologic type, which often evolves from follicular small-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A complete or partial <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 3, 18, or 21 correlated almost exclusively with follicular large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> follicular stages, a <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 2 or duplication 2p often accompanied an accelerated clinical course and a poor response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that several discrete genomic defects may govern the evolution of a patient's malignant disease </plain></SENT>
