<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In two patients, primary nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the lung which presented incidentally were diagnosed following routine chest radiography, exploratory thoracotomy, and the application of histologic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses were confirmed using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase (<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>) technique and transmission electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whereas most investigators had demonstrated intracytoplasmic immunoglobulins in only the large cells of nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> using the standard <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> method, we were able to prove the presence of monoclonal immunoglobulin within the cytoplasm of both the large cells and small cells using a modification of the <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> technique as described by DeLellis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This modification uses very dilute antisera and a prolonged incubation time and is more highly sensitive and specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal immunoglobulin was also shown to be within the cytoplasm of mature plasma cells observed within the interfollicular areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This monoclonal immunoglobulin was the same as that seen within the cytoplasm of the small and large cells of each respective <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy permitted the identification of three cell types within each patient's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>: small cells, large cells, and dendritic reticulum cells((DRCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The finding of the DRCs, presently considered a residual marker of the germinal center, is supporting evidence that both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> studied were nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of B cell derivation </plain></SENT>
