<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Large series have reported this complication in 3% of indolent NHLs, generally following histological transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the disease characteristics and clinical course in seven patients (six females, one male) with indolent B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> who developed <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement during various stages of their illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median ages at diagnosis of systemic and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were 60 and 63 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histologies were: small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (two), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade I (two), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade II (two) and unclear low-grade histology (one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were diverse neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients had parenchymal involvement, three had leptomeningial involvement and two had both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one having bone marrow involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients had a transformation to high-grade histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six patients were treated with systemic and intra-cerebrospinal fluid chemotherapy, and two received radiotherapy as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five patients achieved <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Survival was 1-9 years for treated patients (median 2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three patients died of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement is a rare and unexpected complication of indolent NHL, which should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with new neurological signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This condition is treatable and some patients have a long clinical course </plain></SENT>
