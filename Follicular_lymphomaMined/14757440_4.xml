<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have evaluated the frequency of this translocation in 106 Argentinean non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) patients: 83 with diagnosis of FL and 23 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nested (N) and long-distance PCR (LD-PCR) approaches were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By N-PCR, a total of 42 (51%) FL cases showed BCL-2 rearrangement: 28 (34%) for major breakpoint region (MBR) and 14 (17%) for minor cluster region (mcr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By LD-PCR, additional 23 (28%) new positive cases were found: 10 (12%) for MBR and 13 (16%) for mcr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data make a total of 65 (78%) positive cases for BCL-2 gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> cases, N-PCR detected two (9%) cases with the MBR breakpoint and one (4%) with mcr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven (30%) new positive cases by LD-PCR were found: four (17%) for MBR and three (13%) for mcr, showing a total of 10 (43%) positive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, both FL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> had high frequencies of breakpoints located between MBR and mcr clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our N-PCR results in FL (51%; 95% CI, 40-62%) showed statistical differences with respect to the pooled data from USA (P &lt; 0.0001) and overlapped with the frequencies from Asia and Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, no significant differences with respect to the literature were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This data support the idea that FL may be a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> with distinct molecular pathogenesis and suggest that the geographic differences may be related with the distribution of breakpoints that are widely spread throughout the sequence stretch between MBR and mcr </plain></SENT>
