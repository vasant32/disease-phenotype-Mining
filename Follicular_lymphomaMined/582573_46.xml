<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clinical and histopathologic findings were reviewed in 57 cases in which there had been a diagnosis or suspicion of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the skin other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mycosis fungoides</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were included only if 1) extracutaneous tissue satisfactory for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> classification was available, or 2) there was no evidence of extracutaneous involvement after a minimum of five years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients had systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; in eight of these that disease first became manifest in the skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were two patients with typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206182" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="lyp">lymphomatoid papulosis</z:e> and one with a somewhat similar but solitary lesion which did not recur after excision; we have termed the latter a "solitary lymphomatoid papule." The remaining 19 cases without extracutaneous involvement were regarded as benign <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinically, the cutaneous lesions of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were difficult to distinguish from those of <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp>; only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206182" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="lyp">lymphomatoid papulosis</z:e> was distinctive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histologically, it was found that a definite diagnosis of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mycosis fungoides</z:e>) could be made in the skin when three criteria were fulfilled: 1) exclusive presence or marked preponderance of medium-sized or larger lymphocytes, 2) absence of preferential involvement of the upper dermis, and 3) absence of extensive epidermal infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These criteria were met in 21 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206182" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="lyp">lymphomatoid papulosis</z:e>, the infiltrate was predominantly composed of large lymphocytes but was primarily limited to the upper dermis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The "solitary lymphomatoid papule" contained a similar cell population and involved the full thickness of the dermis; however, it displayed a prominent intraepidermal component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fourteen cases of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> were characterized by a mixture of lymphocytes of varying size or a predominance of small lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nine cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> exhibited at least one of three findings not observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; these findings were 1) germinal centers, 2) marked paucity of medium-sized lymphocytes in comparison to both small and large lymphocytes, and 3) sharp margination between adjacent groups of small and large lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Aside from one case of small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> which showed deep subcutaneous extension, the remaining cases (13 malignant and 10 benign) could not be reliably differentiated from each other by skin biopsy findings alone and were thus considered histologically indeterminate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases in this group were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the small lymphocytic or follicular types; the failure of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to exhibit a follicular pattern in the skin was a major impediment to its recognition in that location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The cutaneous infiltrates in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of large lymphocytic, Burkitt's, and lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were diagnostic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
