<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The production of therapeutic T-cell populations for adoptive immunotherapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> requires extensive ex vivo cell processing, including the isolation or creation of Ag-specific T cells and their subsequent propagation to clinically relevant numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These procedures must be performed according to the principles of current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) for phase I clinical trials to ensure the identity, purity potency and safety of the cellular product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report we describe our approach to manufacturing and characterizing bulk populations of gene-modified autologous T cells for use in treating follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PBMC from healthy donors, obtained after informed consent, were stimulated in vitro with Ab to CD3epsilon (OKT3) and recombinant human IL-2 and then electroporated with plasmid DNA containing a human CD19-specific chimeric Ag receptor (CAR) gene and HSV-1 thymidine kinase (TK) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stably transfected cells were selected in cytocidal concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16976">hygromycin B</z:chebi> over multiple 14-day stimulation culture cycles and then cryopreserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vials of cryopreserved/selected T cells were used to initiate T-cell expansion cultures to produce cell products for clinical infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These cultures were characterized for phenotype, function and suitability for use in adoptive immunotherapy studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that bulk populations of gene-modified T cells derived from peripheral blood of healthy donors express CD19+ chimeric Ag receptor at low levels and can specifically lyse CD19+ target cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These cells display a differentiated T-effector phenotype, are sensitive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi>-mediated killing and display a non-transformed phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TCR Vbeta usage indicated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> populations tested were polyclonal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ex vivo cell expansion from cryopreserved cell banks is sufficient to produce doses of between 5 x 10(9) and 1 x 10(10) cells/run </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One of three transductions resulted in a population of cells that was not suitable for infusion but was identified during release testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No populations displayed any evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp>, fungal or mycoplasma contamination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: We have established a manufacturing strategy that is being used to produce T cells for a phase I clinical trial for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Genetically modified T cells have been characterized by cell-surface marker phenotype, functional activity against CD19+ targets and requisite safety testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These pre-clinical data confirm the feasibility of this approach to manufacturing T-cell products </plain></SENT>
