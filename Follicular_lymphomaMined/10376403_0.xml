<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim of the study was to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> at molecular level using polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined a diverse set of B-NHL (90 patients--48 men, range 18-76 years, mean age 53 years and 42 women, range 20-86 years, mean age 54 years) to detect immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>32 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e>-centrocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (12 men, range 45-64 years, mean age 52 years and 20 women, range 29-85 years, mean age 53 years) were also studied for translocation (14,18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA was isolated from lymphatic nodes, bone marrows and peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Translocation (14,18) was founded in 38% lymphatic nodes, 36% bone marrows and in 50% of peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The detection rate of IgH PCR varied according to the morphologic type of the analyzed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A high detection rate (100%) was observed in low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, while in high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was in 62% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In bone marrows samples from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, IgH PCR positivity was observed in 50% cases without leukaemic blood picture and in 64% cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in peripheral blood picture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In peripheral blood with bone marrow infiltration, but without the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (morphological assessment) we observed 71% IgH PCR positive samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In case, when bone marrow and peripheral blood were morphologic negative, we identified 64% positive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Using t(14,18) and IgH PCR we detected neoplastic population in 81% follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IgH PCR and t(14.18) PCR are convenient additional technology for detection of neoplastic lymphocytes in B-NHL, particularly when <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunological marker analysis are insufficient </plain></SENT>
