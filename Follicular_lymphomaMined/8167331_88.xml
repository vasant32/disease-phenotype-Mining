<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that an evolutionary conserved gene LAZ3, encoding a zinc finger protein, is disrupted and overexpressed in some B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (mainly with a large cell component) that show chromosomal rearrangements involving 3q27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the breakpoints involved in these rearrangements are focused in a narrow major translocation cluster (MTC) on chromosome 3, we used genomic probes from this region to study the molecular rearrangements of LAZ3 in a large series of patients (217) with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis showed LAZ3 rearrangement in 43 patients (19.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rearrangement was found in 11 of the 84 patients (13%) with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but was most frequent in aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (diffuse mixed, diffuse large cell, and large cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> subtypes), in which 31 of the 114 patients (27%) were affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The highest proportion of LAZ3 alteration was observed in B-cell aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (26 of 71 cases, 37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 32 patients with 3q27 chromosomal abnormality had no LAZ3 rearrangement, suggesting the possibility of LAZ3 involvement outside the MTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, 18 of the 39 patients with LAZ3 rearrangement and available cytogenetic results did not have visible chromosomal break at 3q27, suggesting that almost a half of the rearrangements are not detectable by cytogenetic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No statistical association could be found between LAZ3 status and initial features of the disease or clinical outcome in either follicular or aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that LAZ3 alteration is a relatively frequent event in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, especially in those of aggressive histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It could be used as a genomic marker of the disease, and further studies are needed to clarify clinical implications of these alterations </plain></SENT>
