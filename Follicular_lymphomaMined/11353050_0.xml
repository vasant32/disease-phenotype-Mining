<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of the primary gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are thought to be of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) origin, and neither bcl-6 gene rearrangement nor protein expression is found in low-grade gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the MALT type as in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marginal zone cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, bcl-6 protein expression was identified in high-grade gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, suggesting its role in high-grade transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis for bcl-6 primer was performed in order to ascertain the molecular mechanisms of bcl-6 protein expression in primary gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total 31 cases of gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were classified into low-grade gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of MALT type (n = 13), high-grade gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of MALT type (n = 6) and gastric diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bcl-6 mutations were observed in 11 of 13 (84.6%) low-grade gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the MALT type and in 8 of 12 (66.7%) diffuse large B-cell gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 6 cases of the high-grade gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the MALT type, both the low- and high-grade components demonstrated the same frequency (3/6, 50%) of mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The tissue obtained from the marginal zone of Peyer's patch by microdissection technique revealed no bcl-6 mutations by the PCR-SSCP analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the acquisition process of bcl-6 mutations by the marginal zone cells may be involved in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> of the stomach, but our data does not explain the reason why bcl-6 protein is expressed only in high-grade gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
