<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We propose a report on automatic classification of three common types of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal was to find patterns indicative of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and allowing classifying these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> by type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a computer vision approach for quantitative characterization of image content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A unique two-stage approach was employed in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the outer level, raw pixels were transformed with a set of transforms into spectral planes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Simple (Fourier, Chebyshev, and wavelets) and compound transforms (Chebyshev of Fourier and wavelets of Fourier) were computed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Raw pixels and spectral planes were then routed to the second stage (the inner level) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the inner level, the set of multipurpose global features was computed on each spectral plane by the same feature bank </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> computed features were fused into a single feature vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The specimens were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> (H) and eosin (E) stains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Several color spaces were used: RGB, gray, CIE-L*a*b*, and also the specific stain-attributed H&amp;E space, and experiments on image classification were carried out for these sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The best signal (98%-99% on earlier unseen images) was found for the HE, H, and E channels of the H&amp;E data set </plain></SENT>
