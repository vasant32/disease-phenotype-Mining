<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed 30 cases of THRLBCL to evaluate its <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> based on morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cases were classified according to the appearance of the large neoplastic B cells into three morphologic variants: 1) lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&amp;H-like) (resembling the L&amp;H cells of nodular lymphocyte predominance Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (14 cases); 2) centroblast (or immunoblast)-like (10 cases), and 3) Reed-Sternberg cell-like (resembling the neoplastic cells of classic Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) (6 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a panel of immunohistochemical stains, including those with specificity for germinal center B cells: CD20, CD79a, CD30, CD15, epithelial membrane antigen, BCL-2, BCL-6, and CD10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The /JH polymerase chain reaction assay was further performed to investigate a relationship to follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results were correlated with Epstein-Barr virus status as determined by staining for latent membrane protein and EBER-1 in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were of B-cell immunophenotype with strong surface CD20 reactivity in the neoplastic large lymphoid cells, although CD79a was more inconsistently and weakly expressed (10 of 17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nuclear positivity for the BCL-6 protein was detected in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in 26 of 29 (90%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, differences in expression of other antigens were encountered in the histologic subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Epithelial membrane antigen positivity, a feature often seen in nodular lymphocyte predominance Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, was observed in 11 of 30 (37%) cases and was most commonly seen in cases with L&amp;H cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> (8 of 14; 57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CD30 expression was observed in 9 of 30 (30%) cases but was most frequent in cases with Reed-Sternberg-like <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> (3 of 6 [50%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CD10 expression was infrequent overall (3 of 29; 10%), with 2 of 3 positive cases identified in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The overall rarity of positivity for CD10, BCL-2 (3 of 22; 13%), and -2 JH rearrangement (1 of 28; 4%) indicates a lack of connection to follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The three cases that were negative for BCL-6 protein were LMP-1 positive and EBER-1 positive by in situ hybridization, and 2 of 3 had neoplastic cells with Reed-Sternberg-like <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that although a large proportion of THRLBCL represent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of germinal center B cell derivation, they exhibit a diversity of morphologic and immunophenotypic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A subset of THRLBCL may be related to nodular lymphocyte predominance Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A small percentage show features closely resembling classic Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and could be considered a variant of grey zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
