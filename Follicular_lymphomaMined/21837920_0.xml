<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NMZL) is an indolent B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that originates from the marginal zone of B-cell follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> is rather uncommon, and shares some morphologic and immunophenotypic similarities with the extranodal form of marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, diagnosis of NMZL implies the exclusion of lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and lymph node involvement by extra nodal or splenic marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> In addition, its distinction from reactive conditions, including T-zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, are sometimes problematic based on morphologic grounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient who presented with cervical and inguinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathies</z:hpo> and high <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> indexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow and lymph node biopsies were performed for definitive diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow histological and immunophenotypic examinations were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and excluded haematological disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, lymph node evaluation showed some features compatible with a possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo>, even though no definite diagnosis could be made based on morphologic and immunohistochemical investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, the problem of a differential diagnosis between NMZL and a florid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> of monocytoid B-elements was posed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, in order to assess the nature (neoplastic vs. reactive) of the lesion, molecular analysis of the immunoglobulin genes was performed by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Notably, although no clonal rearrangements were revealed by IGHV@ analysis, further evaluation of the immunoglobulin light chain (IGKV@) confirmed the presence of a clonal B-cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, a final diagnosis of NMZL was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this case is a good example of the crucial role of complete molecular analysis in the diagnostic work up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
