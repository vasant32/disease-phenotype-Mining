<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed an in vivo purging method capable of providing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-free stem cell products from most patients with mantle cell or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and bone marrow involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a prospective study, 15 patients with CD20(+) mantle cell or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, bone marrow involvement, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-detectable molecular rearrangement received 2 cycles of intensive chemotherapy, each of which was followed by infusion of a growth factor and 2 doses of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The role of rituximab was established by comparison with 10 control patients prospectively treated with an identical chemotherapy regimen but no rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CD34(+) cells harvested from the patients who received both chemotherapy and rituximab were PCR-negative in 93% of cases (versus 40% of controls; P =.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aside from providing PCR-negative harvests, the chemoimmunotherapy treatment produced complete clinical and molecular remission in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 evaluable patients, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 with mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (versus 70% of controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo purging of hematopoietic progenitor cells can be successfully accomplished in most patients with CD20(+) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, including mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results depended on the activity of both chemotherapy and rituximab infusion and provide the proof of principle that in vivo purging is feasible and possibly superior to currently available ex vivo techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The high short-term complete-response rate observed suggests the presence of a more-than-additive antilymphoma effect of the chemoimmunotherapy combination used </plain></SENT>
