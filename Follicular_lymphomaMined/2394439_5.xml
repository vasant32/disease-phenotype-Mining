<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001429" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Warthin's tumor</z:e> which was involved by malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was classified in the Working Formulation as follicular and diffuse, mixed small cleaved and large cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Frozen section immunohistochemical studies revealed an abnormal immunophenotype: immunoglobulin-negative and B-lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gene rearrangement analysis confirmed the diagnosis by demonstrating rearrangements of both the immunoglobulin heavy and kappa light chain genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2 gene was also rearranged, consistent with the presence of the t(14;18) (q32;q21) translocation which is typically seen in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The T-cell receptor beta chain gene retained the germline configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results in this case highlight an advantage of molecular techniques as compared with immunophenotypic analysis: gene expression is not required to demonstrate clonality </plain></SENT>
