<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SNP array analysis was performed with the use of the Affymetrix 10K 2.0 Gene-chip array on DNA from 185 diagnostic FL patients to assess the prognostic relevance of aUPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genetic abnormalities were detected in 118 (65%) of 182 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Number of abnormalities was predictive of outcome; more than 3 abnormalities was associated with inferior overall survival (OS; P &lt; .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sites of recurrent aUPD were detected on 6p (n = 25), 16p (n = 22), 12q (n = 17), 1p36 (n = 14), 10q (n = 8), and 6q (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis aUPD on 1p36 correlated with shorter OS (P = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>aUPD on 16p was predictive of transformation (P = .03) and correlated with poorer progression-free survival (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>aUPD is frequent at diagnosis of FL and affects probability of disease transformation and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
