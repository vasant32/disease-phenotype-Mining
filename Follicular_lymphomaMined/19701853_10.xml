<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pre-therapeutic lymph-node biopsies from 155 patients with NHL (64 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs), 47 de novo diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and 44 peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e>)) were stained by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
