<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median age was 60.5 years and the male:female ratio was 1.5:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most common site of involvement was Waldeyer's ring, followed by the oral cavity, thyroid gland, paranasal sinuses, nasal cavity, and larynx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five percent of the patients were in Stage I or Stage II at admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histologically, diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> accounted for 94% and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> for 6% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The histologic grade according to the Working Formulation System of the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute was low in 11%, intermediate in 75%, and high in 14% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical study showed that the majority of the cases were of B-cell type and only 13 cases (11%) were of the T-cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (eight cases) mainly occurred in the nasopharynx and nasal cavity, whereas four of five thymic T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were found in the palatine tonsil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The over-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5-year survival rate was 54%, and the factors affecting survival were sex, histologic grade, T/B phenotype, clinical stage, and the site of initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival with nasal cavity and Waldeyer's ring <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was 24% and 46%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The poor prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> at these sites might result from the predominance of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the paucity of low grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and the relatively high incidence of cases that were in an advanced stage at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In Stage II, patients treated with combined therapy tended to have a better 5-year survival rate than those treated with radiotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
