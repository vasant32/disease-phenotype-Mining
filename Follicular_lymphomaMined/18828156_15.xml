<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, their exact genomic extension and involved target genes remain to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, we used array-based intermediate-high resolution genomic profiling in combination with Affymetrix gene expression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> specimens from 128 FL patients were analyzed for the presence of genomic aberrations and the results were correlated to clinical data sets and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 114 (89%) of the 128 analyzed cases, a total of 688 genomic aberrations (384 gains/amplifications and 304 losses) were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Frequent genomic aberrations were: -1p36 (18%), +2p15 (24%), -3q (14%), -6q (25%), +7p (19%), +7q (23%), +8q (14%), -9p (16%), -11q (15%), +12q (20%), -13q (11%), -17p (16%), +18p (18%), and +18q (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Critical segments of these imbalances were delineated to genomic fragments with a minimum size down to 0.2 Mb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By comparison of these with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> gene expression data, putative candidate genes were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we found that deletions affecting the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene CDKN2A/B on 9p21 were detected in nontransformed FL grade I-II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For this aberration as well as for -6q25 and -6q26, an association with inferior survival was observed </plain></SENT>
