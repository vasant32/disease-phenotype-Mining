<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven radiologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> nodes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039590" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">testicular tumour</z:e> patients receiving higher doses of external irradiation were measured for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following lymphography spontaneous shrinkage by up to 20% of the surface area of the node was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since spontaneous and continual regression of abdominal nodes can occur exceptionally in nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, treatment was deferred until there was evidence of an increase in the size of nodes judged as being involved by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two forms of systemic therapeutic irradiation were employed, total body (TBI) and hemi-body (HBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of nodal regression with both was comparable but the amount of regression, time to nadir of node size and subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth delay</z:hpo>, was greater for HBI than TBI </plain></SENT>
