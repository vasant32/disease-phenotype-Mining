<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results of this study showed DRC-1 to be expressed in 1/3 of small lymphocytic; 3/3 of mantle zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>); 10/10 of follicular, small cleaved; 6/7 of follicular, mixed; 1/2 of follicular, large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, DRC-1 was not expressed in any of diffuse, small cleaved (0/6) and diffuse, large cell (0/6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although S-100 protein was positive in the majority of these DRC-1-positive cases on the paraffin embedded specimens, positive nodules were less intense and smaller in number compared with those of DRC-1 on frozen tissue specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that in case of small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> found to be positive for DRC-1, the networks of the DRCs are expressed in the pseudofollicular proliferation centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study also suggests that the networks of the DRCs newly appear accompanying the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic growth</z:e> rather than originating from residual germinal centers, and that neoplastic small cleaved cells play a major role in inducing the DRCs in the positive cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>, and small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
