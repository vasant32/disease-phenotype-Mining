<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reliable prognostic markers to differentiate patients who progress rapidly from those who survive for years with indolent disease have not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most cases overexpress Bcl-2, but the pathogenesis of FL remains incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine whether a proteomic approach could help overcome these obstacles, we procured lymphoid follicles from 20 cases of FL and 15 cases of benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> (FH) using laser capture microdissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lysates were spotted on reverse-phase protein microarrays and probed with 21 antibodies to proteins in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, including those specific for posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A panel of three antibodies [phospho-Akt(Ser473), Bcl-2, and cleaved poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase] segregated most cases of FL from FH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Phospho-Akt(Ser473) and Bcl-2 were significantly increased in FL (P = 0.001 and P &lt; 0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the Bcl-2/Bak ratio completely segregated FL from FH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High ratios of Bcl-2/Bak and Bcl-2/Bax were associated with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from disease with differences in median survival times of 7.3 years (P = 0.0085) and 3.8 years (P = 0.018), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using protein microarrays, we identified candidate proteins that may signify clinically relevant molecular events in FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This approach showed significant changes at the posttranslational level, including Akt phosphorylation, and suggested new prognostic markers, including the Bcl-2/Bak and Bcl-2/Bax ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Proteomic end points should be incorporated in larger, multicenter trials to validate the clinical utility of these protein microarray findings </plain></SENT>
