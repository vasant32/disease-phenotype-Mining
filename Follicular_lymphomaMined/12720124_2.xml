<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The genetic basis of this disorder is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have recently found that the genetic makeup of WM cells is different from that commonly reported for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IgH) translocations could not be detected in any case, and a molecular analysis showed that the IgH locus switch mu retained its germline configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>Aneuploidy</z:mp> was not detected using chromosome enumeration probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The only recurrent chromosome abnormality found was deletion of 6q21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lack of legitimate of illegitimate rearrangements at the IgH locus suggests that other mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Given the clear evidence of a familial form of WM and the currently presumed genomic stability of the clonal cells, it is likely that a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037176" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">single gene defect</z:e> may be responsible for disease pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Having found deletions of the long arm of chromosome 6 as the only recurrent aberration, we speculate that a gene involved in B-cell maturation or survival at this locus may be inactivated as a cause of WM </plain></SENT>
