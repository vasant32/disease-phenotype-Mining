<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each subtype was classified by age of animal at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, breed, and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As in man, nodular cleaved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> are rare in animals, the cow having the most varied <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was one cleaved-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in 72 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in dogs, 23 of 81 in cats, and 33 of 90 in cows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were six <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1334971" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">nodular tumors</z:e> of 72 in dogs, two of 81 in cats and eight of 90 in cows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of 16 nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had noncleaved cells and twelve had small or predominantly small cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cats with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were older at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> than cats with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nodularity was not associated with greater age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in dogs and cows </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> was greater with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1334971" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">nodular tumors</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three species, and was equal in cleaved and noncleaved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
