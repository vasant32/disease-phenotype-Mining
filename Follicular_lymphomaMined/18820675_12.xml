<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The assembly of a collection of gene-expression signatures of the major types of B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has identified increased T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 1A (TCL1) expression in multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> types and cases, and has enabled the investigation of the functional and clinical importance of TCL1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specifically, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases show a homogeneously strong expression of TCL1, whereas diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, nodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and splenic marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> display a striking variability in the intensity of TCL1 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was validated in two independent series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis of the genes correlated with TCL1A expression found that variation in the level of expression of TCL1A was significantly associated with some of the most important gene signatures recognizing B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> pathogenesis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, such as germinal center, B-cell receptor, NF-kappaB (and its target genes), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, MAP kinases, TNFR1, TOLL, and IL1R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, TCL1 expression was correlated with shorter time to treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> cases and shorter <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-specific survival in mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> series, thus indicating the clinical and biological significance of TCL1 expression, and suggesting TCL1A as a potential therapeutic target </plain></SENT>
