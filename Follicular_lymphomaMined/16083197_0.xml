<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the clinicopathological and immunohistochemical features of extranodal malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the upper aerodigestive tract according to WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Descriptive study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 77 Thai patients who presented between 1998 and 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Routine histology was performed and stained with H&amp;E and immunohistochemistry, and clinical characteristics were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients included 42 males and 35 females, with an average age of 53.87 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> sites were as follows: Waldeyer ring (n = 42, 54.55%), sinonasal areas (n = 19, 24.67%), oral cavity (n = 9, 11.69%), hypopharynx (n = 4, 5.19%), and larynx (n = 3, 3.90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, 57 tumors (74.02%) were of B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> and 19 tumors (24.68%) were of T-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>According to the WHO classification, 45 cases (58.43%) were large B-cell, 3 (3.90%) were Burkitt, 3 (3.90%) were marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), 4 (5.19%) were follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 1 (1.30%) was precursor B-lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 1 (1.30%) were mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 9 (11.69%) were of peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, unspecified, 9 (11.69%) were extranodal NK/T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, nasal type, and 1 (1.30%) were anaplastic large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In nasal cavity, 8 tumors (42.11%) were extranodal NK/T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, nasal type, 5 (26.32%) were diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 4 (21.05%) were peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, unclassified, and 1 (5.26%) was Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data correspond with series from Japan, Hong Kong, and Korea, but there is a significant difference from Western population in T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of sinonasal area especially extranodal NK/T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of nasal type and peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, unspecified which had a higher frequency in Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, and Korea </plain></SENT>
