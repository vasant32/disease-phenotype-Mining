<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 52 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), 24 had rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a group of 50 patients with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, three of 32 patients with diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of rearrangements in each of these groups, as detected by both major and minor breakpoint cluster region probes, was compatible with that found in other Far Eastern studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the difference in frequency between the groups studied in the Far East and the West was significant, and these two geographically distinct populations also displayed a difference in the breakpoint distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the immunophenotype study of 33 patients with FL, the expression of CD10 antigen correlated with bcl-2 involvement, whereas none of the other B markers emerged as parameters to distinguish between the two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> groups; those with, and without, the rearrangements </plain></SENT>
