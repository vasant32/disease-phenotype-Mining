<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Primary gastrointestinal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (GIFL) is rare and most commonly occurs in the elder women with indolent clinical course, mainly in the duodenum and terminal ileum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted this study to characterize GIFL in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY: A total of 13 cases were retrospectively collected in 4 hospitals in southern and eastern Taiwan up to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pathology review and immunohistochemistry were performed and the clinical data were obtained from chart review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 5 men and 8 women with a median age of 58 years (range, 31 to 74; mean, 55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequent site was ileum (7/13, 54%) with 4 tumors in the terminal ileum and the most common symptom was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> (8/13, 62%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334638" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Multiple lymphomatous polyposis</z:e> was present in 6 patients (46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five (45%) of 11 tumors with surgical resection showed transmural involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most of the cases revealed a predominantly follicular pattern (7/13, 54%) and low-grade disease (grades 1 and 2; 10/13, 77%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> expressed CD10 (62%), Bcl-2 (77%), Bcl-6 (77%), and MUM1 (38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five patients (38%) were at stage IE and 8 (62%) at stage IIE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment included surgery with or without chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients achieved complete remission and relapse occurred in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up time of 51 months (range, 3 to 180; mean, 63), 11 patients (85%) were disease free and no patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We characterized the clinicopathologic features of the first series of GIFL in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> frequently involved ileum with a favorable prognosis </plain></SENT>
