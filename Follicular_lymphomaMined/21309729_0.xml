<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The determination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification product sizes of the Bcl-2/IgH fusion gene from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) provides evidence of clonal identity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The present study describes detection of Bcl-2/IgH fusion gene clonality utilizing a small, simple microcapillary electrophoretic chip combined with a real-time PCR method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The microcapillary electrophoretic chip system effectively detects size differences among the Bcl-2/IgH fusion gene amplification products of FL from patient samples; something that is not possible using traditional gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also describe the potential of this system to utilize formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples sectioned on charged slides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The simple detection of Bcl-2/IgH fusion gene clonality using a microcapillary electrophoretic chip provides reliable information for monitoring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> of FL, and can be an effective tool for use in clinical laboratories </plain></SENT>
