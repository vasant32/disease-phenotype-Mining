<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By contrast, its usefulness to visualize indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> characterized by a lower cellular turnover has not clearly been defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated accuracy and clinical usefulness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG-PET in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 64 patients with FL WHO grade I - III (48, 5, and 11 patients) were imaged at our institution to assess the value of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG-PET for imaging of FL of different gradings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 115 scans (48 before therapy and 67 for response assessment after treatment) were performed, and findings were compared to conventional staging including CT-scan of thorax and abdomen, sonography of lymph nodes and bone marrow biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG-PET had a sensitivity of 98%, a specificity of 94%, a positive predictive value of 95% and a negative predictive value of 98% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results were significantly more accurate (P = 0.023) than the conventional radiology studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference (P = 0.093) in the accuracy between patients with indolent (WHO grade I and II) versus aggressive FL (WHO grade III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG-PET scan is a reliable method for staging and follow up of patients with nodal FL irrespective of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grading </plain></SENT>
