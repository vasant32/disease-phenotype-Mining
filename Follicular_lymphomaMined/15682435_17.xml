<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten per-cent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FLs, however, do not show Bcl-2 protein expression with standard immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal Bcl-2 antibody against residues 41-54 of the Bcl-2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the biological background of 18 Bcl-2-negative FL cases grade I, II, or IIIa was investigated by immunohistochemical staining and western blot analysis with alternative antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 protein was demonstrated in five of the 18 cases and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these carried the t(14;18) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 13 cases that were Bcl-2 negative with alternative antibodies, 12 lacked the t(14;18) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PCR and subsequent sequence analysis of cDNA demonstrated that three cases with a t(14;18) contained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in the translocated BCL2 gene, resulting in amino acid replacements in the region of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> recognized by the antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the majority of Bcl-2-negative FL lack a t(14;18) but a significant subset of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> are false negative due to mutations in the BCL2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings may have consequences for the use of Bcl-2 immunohistochemistry for diagnostic purposes </plain></SENT>
