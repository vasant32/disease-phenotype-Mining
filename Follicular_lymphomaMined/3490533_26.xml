<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using isolated idiotype (Id) protein we generated panels of antibodies in two patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, one of whom had never received prior chemo-or radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry and frozen section tissue staining of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> with these monoclonal antibodies (mAb) revealed multiple subpopulations within each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Individual mAb stained between 7% and 83% of surface Ig+ cells in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These subpopulations were overlapping and no single antibody recognized <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, combinations of antibodies seemed to capture total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In some instances, the percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stained by a single mAb varied over time, and differed between lymph nodes sampled at the same time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because a single species of Id protein was used to generate mAb in each case, it appears that the antibodies were directed against idiotopes variably shared by different populations within each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, and this was confirmed by crossblocking studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> cells from one patient were fused to a nonsecreting heteromyeloma line K6H6/B5, and most of the resulting hybrids secreted Id protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four mAb were used to screen the Id proteins secreted by these hybrids, and 11 different variants (16 maximal) were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis of rearranged Ig genes was done in two hybrids and biopsy material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Identically rearranged light-chain genes were seen but it appeared as though extensive somatic variation had occurred in heavy chain genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These studies indicate that: striking Id variation can exist at diagnosis in untreated patients, the percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> represented by an individual variant may change with time and may differ between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sampled from different anatomical locations, and somatic variation appears to be responsible for the observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although this degree of variation makes anti-Id antibody therapy more difficult, appropriate combinations of mAb should be more efficacious than single antibodies in such cases </plain></SENT>
