<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper describes the results of a prospective multicenter study of an intensified purging-free high-dose sequential (i-HDS) chemotherapy schedule with peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) autografting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main feature of this program is harvesting stem cells after intensified chemotherapeutic debulking, with no ex vivo manipulation of PBPCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety-two previously untreated patients aged 60 or younger with advanced-stage FCL were enrolled by 20 Italian centers and evaluated on an intention-to-treat basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>i-HDS proved feasible with limited toxicity (87% patients completed the planned treatment schedule) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>i-HDS led to a complete remission rate of 88% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The projected overall survival and disease-free survival (DFS) were, respectively, 84% and 67% at 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Centralized molecular analysis showed that polymerase chain reaction-negative harvests could be collected in 47% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following autograft, 65% of molecularly evaluable patients achieved clinical and molecular remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The projected DFS at 4 years of this subgroup is 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This result emphasizes the importance of achieving maximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> reduction in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data show that highly effective intensified treatments can now be routinely offered to young patients with poor-risk FCL even at small institutions, with no need for sophisticated and expensive cell manipulation procedures </plain></SENT>
