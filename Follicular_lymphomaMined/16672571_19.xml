<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Age ranged from 1.5 to 16 years (median 9.0 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dogs of 26 breeds, plus 13 of mixed breeding or unknown lineage, were represented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>B-Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (CD79a+) predominated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>), the largest group, involved lymph node (33 cases) and spleen (13 cases), with both tissues involved in five of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) involved lymph nodes (five cases), and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) occurred as solitary splenic masses (three cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nodal CD3+ T-zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (TZL) (10 cases), were included since they resembled late-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> at the architectural level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two cases of marginal zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> (MZH) were included to aid in differentiation of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clonality status was determined in 54 cases by analysis of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) and T-cell antigen receptor gamma (TCRG) gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clonal rearrangement of IGH was detected in 28 of 35 MZL cases (80%), four of four FL cases (100%) and three of three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> cases (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Concurrent cross lineage rearrangement of TCRG was detected in six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> and two FL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clonal rearrangement of TCRG was documented in five of eight TZL cases (63%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Limited survival data obtained for 18 dogs indicated that the B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, and FL) and the T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (TZL) were associated with indolent behavior and long survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although to the authors' knowledge, the true incidence of canine indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is unknown, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> are not rare and may have been underrecognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Recognition of their architectural features, routine application of immunophenotyping, and molecular clonality assessment should alleviate this </plain></SENT>
