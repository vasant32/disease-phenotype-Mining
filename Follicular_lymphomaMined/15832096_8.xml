<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We searched our surgical pathology files for malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> identified from prostate surgical specimens from 1989 to 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 4,831 cases of prostate specimens (3,405 biopsies, 266 transurethral resections, 1,160 prostatectomies) examined at the City of Hope during this period, 29 cases of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> involving the prostate and pelvic lymph nodes were identified (0.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> can be divided into two groups: 1) 18 incidental cases (0.37%) without prior history of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; and 2) 11 cases (0.23%) with concurrent known malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the first group, the patients with pelvic node involvement ranged in age from 59 to 78 years (mean, 69.2 years; median, 70 years), and the patients with prostate involvement ranged in age from 45 to 78 years (mean, 64.6 years; median, 67.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the second group, the patients ranged in age from 53 to 80 years (mean, 66.8 years; median, 69 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases were confirmed by immunohistochemistry or molecular analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten of 18 cases in the first group involved pelvic nodes only, and the other 8 cases were primary prostatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 18 cases in the first group, 13 were small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>/CLL), 3 were marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 1 was mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were not readily apparent in most cases by histologic examination, and may be confused with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000024'>prostatitis</z:hpo> when the prostate was involved or with reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> when pelvic nodes were involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and molecular studies may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For the second group, prostate and pelvic lymph nodes were involved as part of systemic dissemination of concurrent malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was usually easily established in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of 11 cases, 4 were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>/CLL, 4 were follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 2 were mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 1 was diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
