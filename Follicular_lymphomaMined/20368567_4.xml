<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The prognostic value of residual BCL2/immunoglobulin heavy chain (BCL2/IgH) -positive cells in peripheral blood (PB) or bone marrow (BM) after induction treatment in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a prospective randomized phase III intergroup trial of 465 patients with relapsed/resistant follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), we showed that addition of rituximab to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> induction results in increased overall and complete response rates, and that rituximab maintenance strongly improves median progression-free survival (PFS) as well as overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we studied whether BCL2/IgH major break point levels in PB/BM correlated with response rates/quality for the induction phase and PFS for the maintenance phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Samples were obtained before and after induction therapy and at the end of the 2 years maintenance/observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BCL2/IgH major break point-positive cells were quantified by genomic quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 792 samples from 238 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pretreatment BCL2/IgH levels had no significant prognostic value for overall response or complete remission rates after induction treatment, but pretreatment positive BM results had an adverse prognostic value for PFS from first randomization (P = .023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, BCL2/IgH levels at the end of induction treatment had no prognostic value for PFS from second randomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The highly significant improved PFS by rituximab maintenance was observed in both BCL2/IgH PB/BM-positive and -negative groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Postinduction BCL2/IgH major break point status in BM/PB is not useful for decisions on subsequent therapy for patients with relapsed/resistant FL </plain></SENT>
