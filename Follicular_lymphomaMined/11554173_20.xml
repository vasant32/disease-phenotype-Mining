<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The number of CD20 antibodies bound per cell (CD20 ABC) in bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood (PB), and lymph node aspirate (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="48010">LNA</z:chebi>) samples from patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (B-CLL) or other B-cell disease was studied using quantitative flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD20 ABC differed significantly with the specimen type in B-CLL, being highest in PB (mean, 9,051) and lower in BM (mean, 4,067) and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="48010">LNA</z:chebi> (mean, 3,951) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No difference in CD20 ABC between BM and PB samples was found in splenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, we found a significant difference of CD20 ABC by type of disease: lowest in B-CLL; higher in splenic, follicular, and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; and highest in hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lower CD20 surface antigen levels in BM and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="48010">LNA</z:chebi> than in PB in B-CLL may have clinical relevance with regard to the efficacy of rituximab therapy </plain></SENT>
