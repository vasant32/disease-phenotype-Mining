<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The microenvironment influences outcome in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our hypothesis was that several immune cell subsets are important for disease outcome and their individual prognostic importance should be demonstrable in the same analysis and in competition with clinical factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Seventy follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients with extreme clinical outcome ("poor" and "good" cases) were selected in a population-based cohort of 197 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the 37 good-outcome patients died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 33 poor-outcome patients succumbed in &lt;or=5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the good-outcome patients were followed for a long time and needed no or little treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A tissue microarray was constructed from diagnostic, pretreatment biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cellular subsets were quantified after immunostaining, using computerized image analysis, separating cells inside and outside the follicles (follicular and interfollicular compartments) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry data from the same samples were also used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Independently of the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index, CD4(+) cells were associated with poor outcome and programmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-1-positive and CD8(+) cells were associated with good outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prognostic values of CD4(+) and programmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-1-positive cells were accentuated when they were follicular and that of CD8(+) cells were accentuated when they were interfollicular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follicular FOXP3(+) cells were associated with good outcome and interfollicular CD68(+) cells were associated with poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additionally, high CD4/CD8 and CD4 follicular/interfollicular ratios correlated with poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There are many important immune cell subsets in the microenvironment of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Each of these is independently associated with outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This is the first study showing the effect of the balance of the entire microenvironment, not only of individual subsets </plain></SENT>
