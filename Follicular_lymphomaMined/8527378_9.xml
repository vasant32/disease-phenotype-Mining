<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A classical t(3;14) and t(3;22) were found in three patients (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the remaining cases, eleven different 3q27 abnormalities were demonstrated and characterized with the use of chromosome painting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven of twelve "variant" rearrangements identified in our series affecting 1p32, 1p34, 3p14, 6q23, 12p13, 14q11, and 16p13 have not been reported before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, involvement of both homologs of chromosome 3 in distinct translocations was detected as an unexpected result in two cases and was confirmed via FISH in a third case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The putative bichromosomal rearrangements of the 3q27 region were evidenced by Southern analysis in one of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In another case, FISH with a cosmid spanning the 3q27 breakpoint region demonstrated the involvement of BCL6/LAZ3 only in one of two t(3q27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In our series, which was selected on cytogenetic and molecular criteria, 50% (6 of 12) of cases with BCL6/LAZ3 rearrangement were diagnosed as diffuse, large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DLCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Another 33% (4 of 12) of cases were diagnosed as follicular center <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL), with t(14;18)/BCL2 rearrangement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in three follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases in which multiple samples were analyzed, the disease showed no evidence of histological progression during a follow-up period of 3-14 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
