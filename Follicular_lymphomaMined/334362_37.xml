<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, complete agreement (type and subtype) between institutional and LPPR review diagnoses was found in only 66% of confirmed cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and in only 58% of confirmed cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency with which initial diagnoses were confirmed on LPPR review was highest for three subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>: nodular <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (88%), diffuse histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (86%), and nodular lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (78%); rates of confirmation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other subtypes ranged from 13-50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of this analysis emphasize the necessity of having pathologic review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases entered on major <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> studies so that comparability of cases can be assured and the results of those studies placed in proper perspective </plain></SENT>
