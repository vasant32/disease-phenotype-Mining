<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This translocation results in the fusion of the bcl-2 oncogene on chromosome 18 with immunoglobulin heavy chain genes on chromosome 14, and in the expression of higher amounts of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bcl-2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied bcl-2 expression in biopsies of 108 patients with benign and malignant cutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative diseases</z:e> (B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, primary cutaneous, 42; secondary cutaneous, 21; primary cutaneous T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 21; B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221269" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudolymphoma</z:e>, 24), using a monoclonal anti-bcl-2 antibody on paraffin-embedded tissue sections, bcl-2 protein was detected immunohistochemically in 16 of 63 cases of cutaneous B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, whereas cutaneous T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221269" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudolymphomas</z:e> were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proportion of bcl-2 protein expression was significantly higher in secondary (11/21) than in primary cutaneous B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (5/42; chi 2 test, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsies from 25 of these patients (B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 22; B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221269" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudolymphoma</z:e>, three) were analyzed previously on the molecular level for the t(14;18), using polymerase chain reaction amplification of DNA obtained from paraffin-embedded sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In four of 11 cases of bcl-2 protein-positive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (primary, one; secondary, three) the t(14;18) was detected by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate: 1) bcl-2 protein is expressed in a small portion of cutaneous B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; 2) bcl-2 protein expression is significantly more frequent in secondary than in primary cutaneous B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; 3) only approximately one-third of cases expressing the bcl-2 protein are characterized also by the t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>bcl-2 protein expression might indicate that the cutaneous manifestation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> represents a secondary spread from a node-based <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
