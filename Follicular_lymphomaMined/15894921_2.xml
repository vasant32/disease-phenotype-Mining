<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Though more recent studies suggested that it might be a distinct clinicopathologic entity and/or a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> entity with derivation from germinal center B cells, its histogenetic derivation remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors analyzed 30 cases of THRLBCL to further characterize the origin of the neoplastic cells using immunohistochemical and molecular studies for expression of Bcl-6, CD10, and CD138, as well as rearrangements of IgH/bcl-2 genes on paraffin-embedded tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Half of the cases (15/30) showed Bcl-6 expression and five cases (19%) showed CD10 expression, but none had CD138 expression (0/20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only three cases showed coexpression of both Bcl-6 and CD10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecular studies performed in 21 cases detected rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy gene in 18 cases, with none having detectable Bcl-2 gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, the cell origin of neoplastic cells in THRLBCL is composed of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of proliferating peripheral B cells, with only some cases originating from germinal center B cells and others derived from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> origins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lack of Bcl-2 gene rearrangements seems to argue against a possible progression from preexisting follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterpart of the neoplastic cells cannot at this time be the sole basis for the subclassification of THRLBCL </plain></SENT>
