<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> secondary lymphoid organs, specific stromal cell subsets provide a highly specialized microenvironment that supports immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular, fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) mediate immune cell migration, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, and reciprocal interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The role of FRCs and their postulated progenitors, that is, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), in FL remains unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the relationships between FRCs and MSCs and their capacity to sustain malignant B-cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings strongly suggest that secondary lymphoid organs contain MSCs able to give rise to adipocytes, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, as well as fully functional B-cell supportive FRCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro, bone marrow-derived MSCs acquire a complete FRC phenotype in response to a combination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha and lymphotoxin-alpha1beta2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, MSCs recruit primary FL cells that, in turn, trigger their differentiation into FRCs, making them able to support malignant B-cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Altogether, these new insights into the cross talk between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and their microenvironment could offer original therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
