<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The optimal treatment for these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> remains undefined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present two cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with transformation to Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both cases dual translocations involving both the bcl-2 and c-myc loci were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent intensive induction immunochemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation and radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first patient received post-transplant mediastinal radiation and developed recurrence in multiple areas outside of the radiation field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second patient received total body irradiation as part of the conditioning regimen, and is without recurrence 18 months after transplant, and 24 months after diagnosis of the dual translocated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We review dual translocation B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the setting of transformation from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and suggest a potential role for total body irradiation in the management of this highly aggressive non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
