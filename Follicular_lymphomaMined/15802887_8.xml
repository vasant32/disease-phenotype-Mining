<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis was conducted and clinical features of histological subtypes were established in 810 patients (age &gt; or = 15 years) with NHL who were treated at 8 major centers representative of Greece </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 435 males and 375 females 95% of them aged &gt;30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>B symptoms were present in 34% of the patients, while 45.3% had stages I-II and 54.6% had stages III-IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LDH was increased in 37% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> formed 88% of the cases whereas T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> formed 12% of the total </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> accounted for 31.1%, aggressive ones for 66.7% and very aggressive ones for 2.4% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> extranodal ones (MALT B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) were the most common subset while follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> grade I and II and small lymphocytic ones presented with equal frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL) was the most common subtype; this entity along with large-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> accounted for 45.2% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, peripheral T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the T/null-cell type were the most common subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common extranodal presentation was the gastrointestinal tract (GI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Next in frequency were primary extranodal NHL of the head and neck region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MALT B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were found in almost half of the patients with GI tract NHL, whereas in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other extranodal places DLCL was the predominant histological subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The median survival for indolent and aggressive NHL was 123.5 and 55.5 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of a large series of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in Greece using the WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It appears that there are no significant differences between NHL in Greece and other large series as far as clinical and extranodal presentation is concerned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The frequency of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the current study is comparable to that reported from Asian countries and mainland Europe, but lower than that of US and Northern European series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>There were no important differences in the incidence of the remaining histological subtypes between Greece and other European countries </plain></SENT>
