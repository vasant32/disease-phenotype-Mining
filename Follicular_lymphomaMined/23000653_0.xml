<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The outcomes of conventional therapies for many indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes have dramatically improved over the last several years with the use of monoclonal antibodies, maintenance therapy programs and with the incorporation of radio-immunoconjugates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These significant advances in the armamentarium of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> therapeutics warrant reappraisal of the current role of auto-HCT in the treatment algorithm of indolent NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prospective randomized studies comparing contemporary chemoimmunotherapies against auto-HCT are lacking, leading to significant debate about the role and timing of auto-HCT for indolent NHL in the modern era </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although autografting for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) in first remission has been largely abandoned, it remains a useful modality for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relapsed disease</z:e>, especially for the subgroup of patients who are not candidates for allogeneic transplantation with a curative intent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Auto-HCT can provide durable disease control in chemosensitive transformed FL and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) in first remission, with relatively low toxicity, and remains appropriate in chemoimmunotherapy era </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Contemporary data are also reviewed to clarify the often underutilized role of autografting in relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> and other less frequent indolent NHL histologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The biological basis of the increased risks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancies</z:e> with auto-HCT are reviewed to identify strategies designed to mitigate this risk by, for example, avoiding exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50902">genotoxic agents</z:chebi>, planning early stem cell collection/cryopreservation and minimizing the use of TBI with transplant conditioning, and so on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genetic testing able to identify patients at high risk of therapy-related complications and novel post-transplant immune therapies with the potential of transforming autografting in indolent NHL from a remission-extending therapy to a curative modality are discussed to examine the possibly expanding role of auto-HCT for lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> in the coming years.Bone Marrow Transplantation advance online publication, 24 September 2012; doi:10.1038/bmt.2012.182 </plain></SENT>
