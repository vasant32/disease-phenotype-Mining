<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a 3-tier grading system (Grades 1-3) for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs) based on the absolute number of centroblasts per high-power microscopic field (HPF) in 10 neoplastic follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Grades 1 and 2 FL are still managed as indolent FLs, whereas Grade 3 FL is thought to behave more aggressively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the feasibility of grading FL using ThinPrep (TP) slides and flow cytometry (FC) was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-three cases of lymph node fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> (FNA) from patients with histologically confirmed FL (20 Grade 1, 17 Grade 2, and 16 Grade 3) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of centroblasts present in 300 lymphoid cells and in 10 HPF in TP Papanicolaou-stained slides was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of CD10-positive small cells was calculated with FC results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed with the Jonckheer-Terpstra nonparametric trend test and the Wilcoxon rank sum test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The statistical analysis demonstrated a significant upward trend in the number of centroblasts as the grades increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 methods had statistically significant results to distinguish different grades of FL, except when FC was used to distinguish Grade 2 from Grade 3 FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Counting centroblasts, either in 300 lymphoid cells or per 10 HPF in TP slides, represented a statistically significant method to separate different grades of FL in FNA samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analysis of cell size by FC was not as reliable to distinguish different grades of FL, especially Grade 2 from 3 </plain></SENT>
