<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The human immunoglobulin secreted by these hybridoma cells was used as an immunogen to make murine monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antibodies specific for idiotype, mu heavy chain and lambda light chain, were produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One anti-idiotype antibody was used to document that idiotype-positive cells and low levels of 19S IgM idiotype were present in the patient's blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of each were found to correlate with the patient's disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The monoclonal anti-idiotype was effective in eliminating idiotype-positive cells in vitro by solid phase absorption or by complement-mediated cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The anti-idiotype was also used to analyze the host's immunologic response to his own <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> idiotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was neither a detectable anti-idiotype antibody response produced in vivo nor a detectable population of T cells that expressed idiotype of could bind idiotype </plain></SENT>
