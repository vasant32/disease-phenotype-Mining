<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order fully to identify secondary chromosomal alterations, such as duplications, additions and marker chromosomes that remained unresolved by G banding, 60 cases of t(14;18)-positive follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) were analysed by multicolour karyotyping techniques [multicolour fluorescence in situ hybridization (MFISH)/multicolour banding for chromosome 1 (MBAND1)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 165 additional structural chromosomal aberrations were delineated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An increased frequency of chromosomal gains involving X, 1q, 2, 3q27-q29, 5, 6p11-p21, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14q32, 17q, 18 and 21 and deletions of 1p36, 3q28-q29, 6q, 10q22-q24 and 17p11-p13 was revealed by the MFISH/MBAND1 analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Balanced translocations other than t(14;18) were uncommon, whereas unbalanced translocations were numerous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Deletion of 1p36 and duplication of 1p33-p35, 1p12-p21 and 1q21-q41 were regularly involved in chromosome 1 alterations, seen in 53% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A strong correlation was demonstrated between gains of individual chromosomal bands and increased gene expression, including 1q22/MNDA, 6p21/CDKN1A, 12q13-q14/SAS, 17q23/ZNF161, 18q21/BCL2 and Xq13/IL2RG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unfavourable overall survival was associated with del(1)(p36) and dup(18q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data support the notion that translocation events are primarily responsible for FL disease initiation, whereas the unbalanced chromosomal gains and losses that mirror the gene expression patterns characterize <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> and disease progression, and thus provide further insights into the biology of FL </plain></SENT>
