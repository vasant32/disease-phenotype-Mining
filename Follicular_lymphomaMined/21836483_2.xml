<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our experience with primary FL of the GI tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The surgical pathology computer files at the Massachusetts General Hospital were searched for cases of FL involving the GI tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were included if on staging, the major site of disease was the GI tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine cases were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were collected from electronic medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 27 women and 12 men ranged in age from 29 to 79 years (median, 59 y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> involved the small bowel (19 the duodenum); 8 involved the colon; and 1 involved the stomach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight of 10 tumors that were resected involved the small bowel (jejunum and/or ileum without duodenum) of which 5 presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005214'>intestinal obstruction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were grade 1 or 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunostains showed consistent expression of CD20 (100%), CD10 (97%), and Bcl-2 (97%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among the 34 cases with Ann Arbor staging information, 22 were stage I, 10 were stage II, and 2 were (6%) stage IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of 36 cases with follow-up (median, 4.5 y), 27 patients are alive without disease, 7 are alive with disease, and 2 died of other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Primary FL of the GI tract occurs most often in middle-aged adults with a 2:1 female preponderance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The most frequent site of involvement is the duodenum, followed by the ileum and colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Distal small bowel involvement is more likely to present as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">bowel obstruction</z:e> requiring resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The disease is localized in the bowel and regional lymph nodes in the vast majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The prognosis is favorable even when the disease is disseminated </plain></SENT>
