<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rearrangement of the BCL2 gene with the immunoglobulin (IG) genes is the most frequent genetic abnormality in B cell lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the majority of cases, breakages occur at two breakpoint cluster regions; major breakpoint cluster (MBR) and minor cluster region (mcr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a minority of cases with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), rearrangements involving the 5' flanking region of the BCL2 (5'-BCL2) have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated 196 patients with NHL and 31 with CLL, with regard to rearrangement of the BCL2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hybridization analyses using probes representing the three cluster regions revealed that a total of 57 patients had a rearrangement of the BCL2; 42 (73.7%) were within the MBR, seven (12.2%) were within the mcr, and nine (15.8%) had a rearrangement at the 5'-BCL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The nine patients with 5'BCL2 rearrangement included two with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, four with diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> variant, two with leukemic phase of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and one with CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comigration analysis with probes for the IG heavy chain gene (IGH), kappa-chain gene (IG kappa) and lambda-chain gene (IG lambda), demonstrated a 5'-BCL2/IGH junction at the JH region in four patients with NHL derived from follicular center B cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the 5'flanking region is a third cluster for recombination between the BCL2 and IGH, which is closely associated with the development of follicular center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molecular cloning of a 5'-BCL2/IGH junction demonstrated recombination of the two affected genes in divergent orientation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A 5'-BCL2/IG kappa junction was observed in two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and one with CLL had a 5'-BCL2/IG lambda recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients, including one with a BCL2-MBR/JH junction, lacked obvious recombination of the 5'-BCL2 with IG genes, suggesting the presence of a deletion at the 5'-BCL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> not only in clinicopathological presentation of B cell disease with rearrangement of 5'-BCL2, but also in molecular lesions resulting from the rearrangement </plain></SENT>
