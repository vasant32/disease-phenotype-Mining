<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In a phase II trial we investigated fludarabine phosphate (FAMP) as therapy for patients with relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to determine its effectiveness and toxicity in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 67 assessable patients had a median age of 56 years and had received a median of three chemotherapy regimens before treatment with FAMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The starting dose was 25 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 30 minutes daily for 5 days every 3 to 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High response rates were observed for follicular small cleaved-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FSCCL) (62%), follicular mixed small- and large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (80%), and follicular large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FLCL) (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Responses also occurred in small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>) (33%), transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (33%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mycosis fungoides</z:e> (40%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No responses were observed in other intermediate- or high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (N = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, there were five patients with a complete response, 23 patients with a partial response, and an overall response rate of 37% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was primarily hematologic and infectious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, or neurologic toxicity occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that FAMP has major activity in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fundamental research is needed to understand this differential efficacy in low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> yet lack of efficacy in intermediate- and high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clinical investigations should be done using FAMP in varying dose schedules and in combination regimens </plain></SENT>
