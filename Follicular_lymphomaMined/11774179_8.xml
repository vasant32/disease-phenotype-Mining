<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A monoclonal proliferation of germinal center cells within a lymph node follicle was incidentally discovered during the staging surgical procedures in a patient with Clark III-level <z:hpo ids='HP_0012056'>cutaneous melanoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In one of the 19 axillary lymph nodes examined, we identified a single morphologically atypical lymphoid follicle, predominantly composed of medium-sized cells and immunoreactive for B-cell antigens and for the markers of germinal center origin CD10 and bcl-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A monoclonal rearrangement of the immunoglobulins heavy chains (IgH) was documented by polymerase chain reaction after laser capture microdissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cells of the aberrant follicle expressed the bcl-2 protein at higher levels than the surrounding T lymphocytes in the absence of bcl-2 gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We propose for this lesion the designation of incipient follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present findings also confirm the previously reported association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
