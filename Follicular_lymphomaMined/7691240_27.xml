<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies in cell lines and transgenic animal models have suggested that this results in the suppression of apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in germinal centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>B lymphocytes from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> germinal centers and lymph nodes infiltrated by follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were isolated by immunomagnetic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of cells bearing CD4, CD8, or slgD for study in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells expressing Bcl-2 protein were shown to resist <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> after isolation, and could be induced to proliferate in a culture system previously described for the growth of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By the use of a mouse fibroblast monolayer transfected with the CDw32 Fc receptor to present CD40 monoclonal antibody in the presence of interleukin-4, prolonged culture was possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Karyotypic analysis of cultured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells showed the t(14;18) translocation, with clonal identity confirmed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the breakpoints and direct sequence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings support the hypothesis that resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is an influence on the initiation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and provide a novel means of studying in vitro the intercellular reactions that may be important in progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
