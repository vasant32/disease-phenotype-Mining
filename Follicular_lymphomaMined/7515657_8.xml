<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six samples were from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FLs), and twenty-four were from diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DLCLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two specimens (86%) were obtained by fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> of a diseased node, seven (11.6%) were from involved bone marrows, and one specimen was from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve of the thirty-six (33%) cases with FL had <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 12 in 3-41% of the cells (median, 10%) (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls had three signals in 1.4 +/- 0.7% of cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 12 was found in 62% of the patients who had had FL for more than 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine of the twenty-four cases (37%) with DLCL had more than two copies of chromosome 12 in 4-92% of the cells (median, 78%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine cases were of B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unlike FL cells, some DLCL cells had 4-6 copies of chromosome 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In previously untreated patients, 54% of DLCLs and 26% of FLs had subpopulations of cells containing more than two copies of chromosome 12 (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 2/7 cases of DLCL with polysomy 12 had rearrangement of the BCL2 gene, indicating that the majority of DLCL cases with polysomy 12 did not result from histologic transformation of low grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that FISH of interphase cells is a sensitive method for detecting numerical abnormalities of chromosome 12 in NHL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
