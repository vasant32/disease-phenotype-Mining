<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The TNF family member TRAIL is emerging as a promising cytotoxic molecule for antitumor therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its mechanism of action and the possible modulation of its effect by the microenvironment in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show here that TRAIL is cytotoxic only against FL B cells and not against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells, and that DR4 is the main receptor involved in the initiation of the apoptotic cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the engagement of CD40 by its ligand, mainly expressed on a specific germinal center CD4(+) T cell subpopulation, counteracts TRAIL-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in FL B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD40 induces a rapid <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and protein up-regulation of c-FLIP and Bcl-x(L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The induction of these antiapoptotic molecules as well as the inhibition of TRAIL-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by CD40 is partially abolished when NF-kappaB activity is inhibited by a selective inhibitor, BAY 117085 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the antiapoptotic signaling of CD40, which interferes with TRAIL-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in FL B cells, involves NF-kappaB-mediated induction of c-FLIP and Bcl-x(L) which can respectively interfere with caspase 8 activation or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo>-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that a cotreatment with TRAIL and an inhibitor of NF-kappaB signaling or a blocking anti-CD40 Ab could be of great interest in FL therapy </plain></SENT>
