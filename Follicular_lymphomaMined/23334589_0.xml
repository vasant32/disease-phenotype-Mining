<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: miRNAs have been implicated in numerous tumorigenic pathways, and previous studies have associated miR-202 dysregulation with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types, including follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The miR-202 targetome was identified by ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation-microarray (RIP-Chip), and functional interactions among identified targets were investigated using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also conducted a population-based genetic association study of a polymorphism within the miR-202 stem-loop sequence and risk of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro gain-of-function experiments were further conducted to elucidate the functional significance of the variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 141 potential members of the miR-202 targetome were identified by a transcriptome-wide RIP-Chip assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional interactions among identified targets suggested that miR-202-regulated genes are involved in biologic pathways relevant for hematologic function and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, a genetic association analysis using human blood samples revealed a significant association between a germline mutation (rs12355840) in the miR-202 precursor sequence and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An in vitro functional assay further showed that the variant allele resulted in diminished miR-202 levels, possibly by altering precursor-processing efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-202 is involved in follicular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Impact: These findings implicate miR-202 as a potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and warrant the investigation of miR-202 as a novel biomarker of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
