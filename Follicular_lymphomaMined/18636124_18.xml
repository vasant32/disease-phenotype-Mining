<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic association studies may help identify environmental risk factors and enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 768 coding and haplotype tagging SNPs in 146 genes were examined using Illumina GoldenGate technology in a large population-based case-control study of NHL in the San Francisco Bay Area (1,292 cases 1,375 controls are included here) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses were restricted to HIV- participants of white non-Hispanic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genes involved in steroidogenesis, immune function, cell signaling, sunlight exposure, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotic</z:chebi> metabolism/<z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, energy balance, and uptake and metabolism of cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixteen SNPs in eight pathways and nine haplotypes were associated with NHL after correction for multiple testing at the adjusted q&lt;0.10 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight SNPs were tested in an independent case-control study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Germany (494 NHL cases and 494 matched controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Novel associations with common variants in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor 1 (ESR1) and in the <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> receptor and matrix metalloproteinase gene families were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four ESR1 SNPs were associated with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) in the U.S. study, with rs3020314 remaining associated with reduced risk of FL after multiple testing adjustments [odds ratio (OR) = 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23-0.77) and replication in the German study (OR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.06-0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Several SNPs and haplotypes in the matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3) and MMP9 genes and in the <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> receptor genes, solute carrier family 23 member 1 (SLC23A1) and SLC23A2, showed associations with NHL risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest a role for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> and matrix metalloproteinases in the pathogenesis of NHL that will require further validation </plain></SENT>
