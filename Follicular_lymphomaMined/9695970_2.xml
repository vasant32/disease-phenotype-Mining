<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One had stage III and three stage IV and were resistant to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FDR was well tolerated, the only complication being <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">herpes zoster infection</z:e> in three patients, which was controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2453">aciclovir</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient developed a gastric MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from a different clone than the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, some patients with refractory low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> achieve long-term CR with FDR: therefore this agent may be considered as alternative to stem-cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
