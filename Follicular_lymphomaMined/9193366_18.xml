<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-nine FLCL patients who were histologically reviewed and who received an intensive chemotherapy regimen according to the LNH 87 protocol were analyzed and compared with 1,096 B-cell DLCL patients included in the same protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After intensive induction treatment, 59 patients (67%) achieved a complete remission [CR] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Estimated 5-year survival was 59%, and estimated 5-year freedom from progression (FFP) was 39% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prognostic factors associated with shorter FFP were age greater than 60 years (P = .02), advanced clinical stage (P = .01), abnormal lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level (P = .02), abnormal beta-2 microglobulin (P = .02), B symptoms (P = .03), bone marrow involvement (P = .04), and high expression of bcl-2 protein (P = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When compared with B-cell DLCL patients, FLCL patients were younger (P = .02), had a better Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group (ECOG) status (P = .05), less bulky mass (P = .04), more advanced clinical stages (P &lt; .001), and more bone marrow involvement (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed between FLCL and DLCL patients for response to therapy (67% v 67% of CR), 5-year overall survival (58% v 51%), 5-year disease-free survival (53% v 57%), or FFP survival (39% v 43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FLCL patients have a favorable response rate and survival when treated with intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Their outcome is similar to that of B-cell DLCL patients, and a long-term FFP is observed for a substantial number of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some adverse prognostic factors (including those of the International Prognostic Index, bone marrow involvement, and beta-2 microglobulin) have been identified to define a subset of patients who require other therapeutic approach </plain></SENT>
