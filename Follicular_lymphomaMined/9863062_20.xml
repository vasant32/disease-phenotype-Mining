<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To detect t(14;18)-positive cells present in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissue, bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC), we have established an automated, real-time quantitative PCR using double-labeled fluorogenic probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In relation to t(14;18)-positive genomic DNA or a cloned t(14;18)-DNA fragment, highly reproducible results can be obtained with initial copy numbers between 10 to 10(5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The detection of single copies has been verified by the stochastic multiple-tube approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PBMNC cells obtained during clinical follow-up of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were analyzed by the one-step, real-time quantitative PCR and a two-step, semi-nested PCR combined with a limiting dilution assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The quantitative results obtained by both assays correlate very well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Real-time quantitative PCR has several advantages: (i) it involves less critical pipetting steps, (ii) is less time-consuming and (iii) <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15713">UTP</z:chebi>, in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi>-N-glycosylase, can be used to control carryover contamination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The higher specificity is due to optimized primer annealing conditions and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6636">MgCl2</z:chebi> concentration and the use of AmpliTaq Gold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity is at least as high as by the two-step PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Real-time quantitative PCR will be very helpful in large epidemiological studies and in research for molecular staging and the detection of minimal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumor</z:e> cells, including the analysis of blood stem-cell preparations to be used for transplantation after myelo-ablative therapy </plain></SENT>
