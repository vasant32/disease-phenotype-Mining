<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Altogether, 124 patients with FL were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 63 patients received HDCT with ASCT, and this group was compared with 61 patients who were treated with rituximab and CHOP (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>) chemotherapy and supplementary radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the QoL of the patients was compared to the QoL of healthy people on the basis of two studies about the general health status of the German population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the QoLs of the HDCT group and the conventional therapy group were compared, there was a tendency for better QoL in the HDCT group, maybe due to a higher proportion of patients in complete remission (CR) or a longer follow-up period in the HDCT group (8.5 years vs. 4.5 years in the conventional therapy group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both the HDCT group and the conventional therapy group, the results of the questionnaires showed a reduced QoL compared to the healthy population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study, there was a tendency for better QoL in the HDCT group compared to the conventional therapy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the negative impact of both HDCT and conventional therapy on the QoL of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> should not be underestimated and should lead to the development of less toxic therapy strategies </plain></SENT>
