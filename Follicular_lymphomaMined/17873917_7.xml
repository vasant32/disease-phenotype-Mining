<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Addition of rituximab to chemotherapy for FL has been shown to improve survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The impact of prior therapy with rituximab upon the effectiveness of high-dose therapy (HDT) and ASCT in patients with FL is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients with FL who underwent HDT and ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were categorized according to prior therapy with rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were compared between groups in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and in a well-matched subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 35 patients received prior rituximab and 71 rituximab-naive patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rituximab-naive group had a median overall survival (OS) that was not reached during follow-up, with a median relapse-free (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) survival of 49.9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prior rituximab group also did not reach median OS and had a median <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> of 24.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survivals were not significantly different in this group or in the well-matched subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these results suggest that the use of rituximab-based regimens for the treatment of FL does not compromise the effectiveness of HDT and ASCT as a salvage strategy in patients with FL </plain></SENT>
