<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Because follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) patients have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> outcomes, the FL international prognostic index (FLIPI) was developed to risk-stratify patients and to predict survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, limited data exist regarding the role of FLIPI in the era of routine first-line rituximab (R) and R-chemotherapy regimens and in the setting of community <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the outcome data from the National LymphoCare Study (NLCS), a prospective, observational cohort study, which collects data on patients with FL in the United States (US) community practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 1068 male and 1124 female patients with FLIPI data, most were treated in US community practices (79%); 35% were FLIPI good risk, 30% intermediate risk, and 35% poor risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FLIPI risk groups were significant predictors of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) for patients who undergo watchful waiting (WW), and those who receive non-R-containing regimens, R-alone, and R-chemotherapy combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of contemporary practice with routine R use, stratifying patients into good, intermediate, and poor FLIPI risk groups predicts distinct outcomes in terms of OS and PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FLIPI remains an important prognostic index in the R era and should be used in clinical practices to support discussions about prognosis </plain></SENT>
