<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously found that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the TNFSF13B promoter resulted in increased transcription, suggesting that genetic variation in TNFSF13B may influence its expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore wanted to determine if genetic variation in TNFSF13B is associated with high BAFF levels and non-Hogkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We genotyped 9 tagSNPs within TNFSF13B in a clinic-based study of 441 NHL cases and 475 matched controls and evaluated the association of individual SNPs with risk of NHL; 3 tagSNPs were significant (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When categorized into low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups based on risk alleles, we found the permutation-corrected odds ratio for the trend to be 1.43 (P = 0.0019) for risk of B-cell NHL, 1.69 (P = 0.0093) for diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 1.43 (P = 0.029) for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 1.06 (P = 0.21) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean serum BAFF level in those who carried the low-risk alleles was 2 ng/mL compared with 4.3 ng/mL in those with the high-risk alleles (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data suggest that genetic variation in the TNFSF13B gene is significantly associated with NHL risk and elevated serum BAFF levels </plain></SENT>
