<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is generally assumed that follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) not only morphologically resemble <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> germinal centers but have retained some functional characteristics of their non-neoplastic counterparts as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent IgV gene analyses on a panel of FLs however, strongly suggested that FLs do not retain the capacity of somatic hypermutation and are not being selected on basis of the quality of their mIgV regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To extend these findings, we investigated the follicular organization and class switching in a FL that consisted of both IgM- and IgG-expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells with a high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> load and significant intraclonal V(H) gene diversity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>V(H)-C(mu) and V(H)-Cgamma gene transcripts were amplified and sequenced from samples of approximately 50 tumor cells, isolated from frozen tissue sections by laser microdissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified many different subclones and obtained limited evidence of subclone dominance in individual follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, several subclones were found scattered over different follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> samples contained IgM- and IgG-expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells with, in general, non-identical mutation patterns, which is not in support of ongoing class switching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, no switch circle recombination products were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings indicate that the neoplastic follicles lack the organization and functions typical of reactive germinal centers </plain></SENT>
