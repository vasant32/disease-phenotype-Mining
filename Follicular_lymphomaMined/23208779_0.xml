<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 27 consecutive patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in detection rates was observed in 12 patients who underwent total enteroscopy at both VCE and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBE</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pathologic diagnostic yields stratified by location were 91 % in the proximal duodenum at esophagogastroduodenoscopy, 88 % in the jejunum at antegrade <z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBE</z:chebi>, 52 % in the ileum at retrograde <z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBE</z:chebi>, and 57 % in the terminal ileum at colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VCE and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="28534">DBE</z:chebi> were helpful in determining treatment in 44 % of patients </plain></SENT>
