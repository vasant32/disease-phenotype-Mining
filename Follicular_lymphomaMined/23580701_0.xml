<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An 11-year-old, spayed female domestic <z:mp ids='MP_0000417'>shorthair</z:mp> cat was presented for a right flank wound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On clinical examination, a single non-painful skin tear lesion with irregular edges was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the examination, star-shaped cigarette paper-like <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> appeared spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An abdominal mass was also palpated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Feline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001030'>skin fragility</z:hpo> syndrome (FSFS) was suspected and a multicentric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was diagnosed by fine needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cat's condition declined and it died spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Post-mortem examination confirmed the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neoplastic lymphocytes were not observed in the skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis of the skin was consistent with the morphological aspects of FSFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A possible direct link between the two conditions remains a matter of speculation, but this case report provides the first description of FSFS associated with multicentric follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, multicentric follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> should be considered as a differential diagnosis in cats presenting with FSFS </plain></SENT>
