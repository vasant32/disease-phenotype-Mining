<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody against the CD20 molecule which is used to treat B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 60% of low-grade B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in which rituximab was effective at first, there was no clinical response in a second treatment and a few cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) with transformation to diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a new case and hypothesize about the mechanisms of transformation: a 52-year-old man, in follow-up during 8 years for FL, who after rituximab treatment and complete remission of FL showed progressive disease involving the liver and duodenal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical and molecular studies were performed on paraffin-embedded tissue samples of lymph nodes, the small intestine, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023903" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After rituximab treatment, biopsies of a liver lesion and the small bowel both showed CD20-negative large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecular study of the initial and relapse specimens shows a CDR2 IgH rearrangement with the same height and t14;18 (MBR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rapid relapse with the same rearrangement of IgH seems to support the interpretation that the change of grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and loss of CD20 expression occurred before rituximab treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The existence of a varying proportion of a CD20-negative cell population in every B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> which does not respond to rituximab should therefore be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reduction of CD20 expression could be a resistance mechanism to rituximab retreatment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> as a consequence of the progression of low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B-NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is necessary to perform new biopsies to evaluate CD20 expression in relapse or the progression of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> after rituximab treatment </plain></SENT>
