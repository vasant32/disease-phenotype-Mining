<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Incident rates were estimated by age and sex for six Asian ethnic groups--Asian Indian/Pakistani, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese--in five United States <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry areas during 1996-2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For comparison, rates for non-Hispanic Whites were also estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 1996-2004, Filipinos had the highest (24.0) and Koreans had the lowest incidence (12.7) of total lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By subtype, Vietnamese and Filipinos had the highest incidence for diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) (8.0 and 7.2); Japanese had the highest incidence of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (2.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although a general male predominance of lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> was observed, this pattern varied by lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whites generally had higher rates than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Asian ethnic groups for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and most <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes, although the magnitude of the difference varied by both ethnicity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The observed variations in incidence patterns among Asian ethnic groups in the United States suggest that it may be fruitful to pursue studies that compare Asian populations for postulated environmental and genetic risk factors </plain></SENT>
