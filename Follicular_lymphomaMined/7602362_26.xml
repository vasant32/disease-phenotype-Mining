<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe the course of patients following histologic transformation (HT) from low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to intermediate- or high-grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were identified from data bases in the Division of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> and the Department of Surgical Pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HT was defined as the conversion of a follicular small cleaved-cell or follicular mixed small cleaved-cell and large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to a diffuse large-cell, diffuse mixed small cleaved-cell and large-cell or any high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We analyzed the clinical course of 74 low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients with histologically proven transformation occurring from 1965 to 1988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median time from diagnosis to HT was 66 months, and the median age at HT was 58 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median duration of survival after transformation was 22 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anatomic extent of disease at HT (limited v extensive, P = .01), prior chemotherapy (none v any, P = .01), and response to therapy (complete v partial or none, P = .005) at time of HT were identified as significant predictors of survival after HT in backward-selection Cox regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients attained a complete response to therapy at HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They had a median survival duration of 81 months after HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A subset of patients with HT from low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to intermediate- or high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> enjoys relatively long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with limited disease and no previous exposure to chemotherapy have the most favorable prognosis </plain></SENT>
