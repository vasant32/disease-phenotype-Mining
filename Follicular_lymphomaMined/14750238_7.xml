<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While bcl-6 and CD10 are expressed characteristically in FLs, their significance for biologic behavior of FL has not been studied previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Samples from 73 patients with FL and clinical follow-up from 7 to 231 months were evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with high levels of bcl-6 expression had favorable overall survival (OS) (P = .003), disease-specific survival (DSS) (P = .033), and time to treatment failure (P = .003) compared with patients with low levels of bcl-6 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that the results for OS, DSS, and time to treatment failure were independent of the international prognostic index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with CD10+ FLs also had longer OS (P = .001), DSS (P = .007), and time to treatment failure (P = .004), and grade 1 FL was associated with better OS (P = .01) and a statistical trend for longer DSS (P = .05) and time to treatment failure (P = .05), but these results were not independent of bcl-6 expression or the international prognostic index in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
