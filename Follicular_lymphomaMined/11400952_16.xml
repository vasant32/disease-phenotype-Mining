<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis was performed to investigate the outcome of high-dose therapy (HDT) and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> beyond first remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ninety-two patients with primary induction failure or relapsed follicular low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FLGL), follicular large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FLCL), and transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (TFL) were treated with myeloablative therapy consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (60 mg/kg), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (100 mg/kg), and either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3423">carmustine</z:chebi> (BCNU;15 mg/kg) or fractionated total body irradiation (FTBI; 1200 cGy) followed by transplantation of purged autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the 49 patients with relapsed FLGL, the median age was 49 years and the median interval from diagnosis to HDT was 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 4-year estimate of overall survival (OS) was 60% (95% confidence interval [CI], 45%-75%) and of disease-free survival (DFS) was 44% (95% CI, 29%-59%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with the FTBI-containing HDT regimen was associated with significantly longer DFS (P = .04) and OS (P = .04) in our multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OS was also significantly longer among those treated with 3 or fewer chemotherapy regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the 26 FLCL patients, the median age was 51 years and in 31% the indication for HDT was primary induction failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For FLCL patients, the 4-year estimate of OS was 58% (95% CI, 37%-79%) and of DFS was 51% (95% CI, 30%-72%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 17 patients with TFL, 13 (76%) transformed at first relapse, and only 6 patients (35%) achieved complete remission with salvage therapy prior to HDT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For TFL patients, the 4-year estimate of OS was 50% (95% CI, 24%-76%) and of DFS 49% (95% CI, 20%-78%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were 3 occurrences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (1 after treatment with TBI, 2 after BCNU treatment), yielding an estimated incidence of 7% (95% CI, 0%-16%) at 56 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This analysis shows that relapsed FLGL patients treated with 3 or fewer different chemotherapy regimens show inferior survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The HDT regimen containing FTBI appears to be superior to the BCNU-based regimen for relapsed FLGL, although longer follow-up is needed to evaluate late effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Lastly, patients with TFL or induction failure and relapsed FLCL can achieve survival outcome comparable to those observed with the indolent follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
