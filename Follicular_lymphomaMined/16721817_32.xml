<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on patients with biopsy-proven nontransformed and transformed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), B-cell small-cell lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>/CLL), or marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>) who underwent PET and computed tomography (CT) scans within 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Standard uptake values (SUV) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> abnormal foci were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In FL, PET demonstrated 94% sensitivity and 100% specificity for staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PET was more specific than CT for detecting recurrence or assessing therapeutic responses (91% vs. 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FDG avidity among patients with WHO Grades 1, 2, and 3 disease was not significantly different (analysis of variance [ANOVA]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> staging, PET had moderate sensitivity (71%) and outperformed CT alone in the depiction of extranodal sites (85% vs. 57% sensitivity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>/CLL, PET sensitivity was 53% and underestimated disease extent in 5 of 19 patients (26%) compared with CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PET did not affect initial management but confirmed suspected recurrences in 75% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nontransformed FL had a higher SUV (ANOVA, P &lt; .05) compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>/CLL </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PET usefulness in staging low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> varies depending on histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>PET sensitivity is excellent in FL and moderate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>PET is more specific than CT for follow-up in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>PET has limited usefulness for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>/CLL staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, a suggestive pattern of hazy and mild uptake was often noted in positive scans </plain></SENT>
