<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A polymerase chain reaction analysis of biopsy specimens from a total of 52 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> has revealed the presence of the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation in 14 cases (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve involved the major breakpoint region and two included the minor cluster region of the bcl-2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing of the amplified 14q+ junctions from the initial four positive cases (from 21 biopsies) has been previously published and demonstrated the similarity in nature of the break-points to those described in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 52 biopsies have also been studied with a monoclonal antibody to immunolocalize the Bcl-2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases Bcl-2 positivity was observed in the majority of surrounding lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in 11 cases, positive immunostaining in the Sternberg-Reed cells was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of these cases contained the t(14;18) translocation, but 11 cases which were positive for the t(14;18) by PCR did not show Bcl-2 protein staining in the Sternberg-Reed cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This data confirms the presence of t(14;18) in 28% of biopsies from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and demonstrates Bcl-2 protein staining in a variable proportion of Sternberg-Reed cells of some cases </plain></SENT>
