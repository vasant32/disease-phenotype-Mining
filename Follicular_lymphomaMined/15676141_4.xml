<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The BCL2 gene was identified through molecular analysis of the breakpoints involved in the t(14;18)(q32;q21) found in the majority of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Variant translocations leading to juxtaposing of the BCL2 with either the IGK or IGL gene have been recognized in B-cell malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, although they are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases that had variant translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three cases had simple translocations involving two chromosomal regions: t(18;22)(q21;q11.2) in two cases and t(2;18)(p11.2;q21) in the third case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complex translocations affecting more than two chromosomes were seen in the remaining four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization using the LSI IGH/BCL2 DNA probes revealed rearrangements of the BCL2 gene locus in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, expression of BCL2 protein was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases; only five of the seven cases expressed BCL6 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Morphologically, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were categorized as B-cell follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in six cases and in the seventh case as diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Richter syndrome) transformed from preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In case 2, the variant t(18;22) was seen as a secondary aberration evolving from a <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 12 clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings revealed that BCL2 rearrangements in some malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> occur through variant simple or complex chromosomal translocations, but always involving the IGH, IGK, or IGL chromosomal site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, fluorescence in situ hybridization proved to be an important tool in evaluating these cases by showing IGH/BCL2 gene fusion or repositioning of the BCL2 gene </plain></SENT>
