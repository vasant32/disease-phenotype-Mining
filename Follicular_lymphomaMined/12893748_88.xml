<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 176 (19%) received allogeneic, 131 (14%) received purged autologous, and 597 (67%) received unpurged autologous transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five-year treatment-related mortality (TRM) rates were 30%, 14%, and 8% and 5-year recurrence rates were 21%, 43%, and 58% after allotransplantation, purged autotransplantation, and unpurged autotransplantation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, allotransplantation had higher TRM and lower disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Purged autotransplantation had a 26% lower recurrence risk than unpurged autotransplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five-year probabilities of survival were 51%, 62%, and 55% after allogeneic, purged autotransplantation, and unpurged autotransplantation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Advanced age, prolonged interval from diagnosis to transplantation, high <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH), refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005956" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disease, bone marrow</z:e> involvement, low performance scores, and transplantation between 1990 and 1993 were associated with adverse outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total body irradiation was associated with higher TRM but lower recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> and recurrence after allotransplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that both allogeneic and autologous transplantation can induce durable remissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There may be a benefit to graft purging in autologous transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The decreased recurrence after allotransplantation is offset by increased TRM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We did not detect a correlation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) and recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Finally, outcomes of transplantation for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> show improvement over the past decade </plain></SENT>
