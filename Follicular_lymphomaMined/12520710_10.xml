<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of CD10+ cells with high bcl-2 expression predicted the presence of FL rather than RH with a positive predictive value of 100% and negative predictive value of 96% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD10+ cells with high bcl-2 expression also were found in a subset of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and were otherwise rare in other types of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast with immunohistochemical studies, a reduced but apparently measurable level of bcl-2 was present in benign follicular center cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hematogones showed lower bcl-2 levels than did FL cells in the bone marrow, and neutrophils were bcl-2- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measurement of bcl-2 expression levels by multiparameter flow cytometry offers a rapid, quantitative assessment that may assist in the diagnosis of FL in lymph nodes or bone marrow, even when other CD10+ cells or admixed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells are present </plain></SENT>
