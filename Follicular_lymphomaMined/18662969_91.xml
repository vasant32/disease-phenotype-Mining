<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare the long-term outcome of patients with previously untreated follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) needing therapy, after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CVP) versus CVP plus rituximab (R-CVP) and to evaluate the predictive value of known prognostic factors after treatment with R-CVP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with previously untreated CD20-positive stage III/IV FL were randomly assigned to eight cycles of R-CVP (n = 159) or CVP alone (n = 162) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up period was 53 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The primary end point-time to treatment failure (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi>), which included patients without a response after four cycles as an event-was significantly prolonged in patients receiving R-CVP versus CVP (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Improvements in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other end points, including overall and complete response rates (P &lt; .0001), time to progression (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>; P &lt; .0001), response duration (P &lt; .0001), time to next antilymphoma treatment (P &lt; .0001), and overall survival (OS; P = .029; 4-year OS: 83% v 77%;) were achieved with R-CVP versus CVP alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate analyses demonstrated an improvement in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> with R-CVP versus CVP irrespective of the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) subgroup, the International Prognostic Index (IPI) subgroup, baseline histology, and the presence or absence of B symptoms or bulky disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, FLIPI retains a strong predictive power for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> in the presence of the trial treatment effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> outcome measures, including OS, confirm the benefit of adding R to CVP in the front-line treatment of FL </plain></SENT>
