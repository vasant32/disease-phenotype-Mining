<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: Fine needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> biopsy (FNAB) is emerging as a technique of potential value in the diagnosis of benign and malignant lesions in areas such as the breast and thyroid gland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its place in distinguishing reactive from neoplastic lymphoid proliferations, when compared to the established practice of excision biopsy and histopathology, continues to undergo evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>Morphology</z:mp> alone discriminates poorly between atypical or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> as seen in the presence of Epstein-Barr or human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore the polymorphic populations of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> may mimic reactive changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition previous classifications of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> using working formulation or Kiel classification relied heavily on architecture, which is a feature not reflected in cytology smears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The World Health Organisation approach includes clinical features, immunophenotyping and cytogenetic profiles to define <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> of immunohaematopoietic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry on fine needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> biopsy offers additional advantages in being rapid and objective in quantitatively as well as qualitatively documenting cell surface characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients referred for this procedure to Tygerberg Academic Hospital with suspected nodal or extranodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> between January 2002 and December 2004 were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In each case flow cytometry and cytomorphology were correlated with histopathology on tissue biopsy, bone marrow examination and clinical follow-up for confirmation of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results of the 124 cases were tabulated and statistically processed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eighty-one met the inclusion criteria, thirteen (16.1%) were not malignant, two (2.5%) were falsely negative, two (2.5%) were equivocal needing histology and in the remaining sixty-four (79%) diagnosis was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: Fine needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> coupled with flow cytometry can reliably distinguish between nodal and extranodal neoplastic B-cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that appropriate use, in a collaborative multidisciplinary setting, may eliminate the need for surgical procedures in many cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These advances are not widely recognised and this is particularly true in South Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, such an approach has been prospectively evaluated in the Western Cape showing that the combination of ready availability and diagnostic accuracy, after an initial learning curve, allow accurate characterisation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematologic malignancies</z:e> so that excision biopsy may be reserved for specific further studies to provide data not available from this less invasive procedure </plain></SENT>
