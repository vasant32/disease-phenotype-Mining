<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Unlike nodal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NFL), Primary cutaneous follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (PCFLs) rarely express Bcl-2 protein or t(14;18)(q32;q21) (Bcl-2/IgH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to further characterize PCFL in a large series from North America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical data and archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue were obtained from 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PCFL was defined as follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> limited to the skin at the time of diagnosis and within the first 6 months after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specimens were analyzed for the expression of CD3, CD10, CD20, Bcl-2, and Bcl-6 proteins by immunohistochemistry as well as for the presence of t(14;18)(q32;q21) by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The male-to-female ratio was 1.5:1, with a median age of 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients had lesions on the head and neck, five had lesions on the trunk, and three had lesions on both head and trunk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data were available in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, with a mean length of 35.8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority of the patients were treated with radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were alive at last follow-up except one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recurrence was noted in seven patients (22%), after a mean disease-free survival time of 17.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CD10 and Bcl-6 expression were seen in 29 (91%) of 32 and 31 (97%) of 32 cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 expression was noted in 13 (41%) of 32 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>PCR results for t(14;18)(q32;q21) were positive in 11 (34%) of 32 patients and showed correlation with Bcl-2 protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The sequencing of the t(14;18)(q32;q21) amplicons confirmed unique breakpoints in each of the seven tested cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Comparison between the Bcl-2 and/or t(14;18)(q32;q21)-positive and t(14;18)(q32;q21)-negative cases revealed no significant difference in age, site, clinical course, or outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We demonstrated Bcl-2 protein expression and t(14;18)(q32;q21) in a significant minority of cases, suggesting a relationship with NFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It remains to be seen whether, on longer follow-up, there is any clinical difference in cases with and without t(14;18)(q32;q21) </plain></SENT>
