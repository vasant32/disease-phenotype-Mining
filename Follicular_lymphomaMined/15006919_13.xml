<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Previous epidemiologic studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus (HCV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B-NHL) have yielded conflicting results, perhaps due to differences in the classification of B-NHL and the choice of non-population-based control groups that may not reflect the background population prevalence of HCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the link between HCV and NHL, we conducted HCV testing on serum samples of 998 women (464 cases; 534 controls) from a population-based case-control study of women in Connecticut </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum samples were screened for HCV antibodies using an enzyme immunoassay; positive samples were confirmed by additional testing for HCV antibodies and for serum HCV <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Approximately 2% (8 of 464) of cases and 1% (5 of 534) of controls tested positive for HCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk of NHL associated with HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> appeared to be concentrated among B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> [odds ratio (OR) 2.0; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6, 8.2], particularly among follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (OR 4.1, 95% CI 0.8, 19.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The primary strength of this study is our use of a population-based study design, although the low prevalence of HCV among women in Connecticut resulted in wide CIs for the estimated association between HCV and B-NHL subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that HCV may be associated with increased risk of development of B-NHL, and that this risk may vary by B-NHL subtype among women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Due to the relatively low prevalence of HCV in our study population and the scarcity of population-based epidemiological research on this subject, our study highlights the need for additional large, population-based studies of the role of HCV in the etiology of B-NHL </plain></SENT>
