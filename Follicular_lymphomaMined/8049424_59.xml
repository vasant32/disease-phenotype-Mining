<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several additional chromosomal abnormalities, which might contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e>, have also been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, prognostic implications of cytogenetic features in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> have not been clearly established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to correlate cytogenetic findings with clinical outcome, we have studied survival and risk of transformation into a more aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 66 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients from whom a lymph node had been karyotyped at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A t(14;18) was the most common abnormality, having been observed in 51 patients (77%), but this showed no correlation with clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventeen other recurrent numerical or structural abnormalities were identified in more than 10% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A high percentage of cells (&gt; or = 90%) with abnormal metaphases and a number of chromosomal breaks higher than 6 were associated with a poor survival (P &gt; .01 each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with an abnormality of chromosome region 1p21-22 (P &lt; .01), of 6q23-26 (P &lt; .001), or of the short arm of chromosome 17 (P &lt; .001) had a significantly shorter survival in univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified a break at 6q23-26 (P = .01) and 17p (P = .01) as independent prognostic factors in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of transformation into a diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was significantly higher in patients with either a 6q23-26 (P &lt; .001) or a 17p (P &lt; .01) abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal analysis of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at the time of diagnosis can thus provide important information about the risk of transformation and survival.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
