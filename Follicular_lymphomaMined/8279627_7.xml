<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In recent reports of the so-called "floral variant" of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, an unusual variant of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> mimicking progressive transformation of germinal centers, questions have been raised regarding whether this process represents a malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 19 examples of the floral variant of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and report our light microscopic, immunohistochemical, and molecular diagnostic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Morphologic changes consisted of effacement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymph node architecture by follicles composed of atypical lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The follicles were surrounded by prominent mantle zones that invaginated irregularly into the follicle centers, often imparting a "floral" appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sufficient material was available for immunophenotypic or genotypic studies in 15 biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve of 15 cases studied by immunohistochemistry demonstrated phenotypes supporting a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five demonstrated light-chain restriction; one was an immunoglobulin-negative B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>; and six, in which only formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue was available, demonstrated overexpression of the bcl-2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis revealed evidence of clonal immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five cases tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 12 of the 15 biopsies studied with these techniques showed immunologic or genotypic support for malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of this study demonstrate that the floral variant of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> does indeed represent a malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
