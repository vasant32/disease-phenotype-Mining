<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These infiltrates were compared with the "host cell infiltrates" in six patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The group with progressive disease was selected to be similar to the group with spontaneous regression in age, sex, histologic characteristics, and stage of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients with spontaneous regression had significantly more T-helper cells in the host cell infiltrate than the control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in numbers of cytotoxic/suppressor T-cells, macrophages, Tac-positive cells, Leu-7-positive cells, or proliferating cells </plain></SENT>
