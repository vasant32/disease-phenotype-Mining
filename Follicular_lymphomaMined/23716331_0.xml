<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLL is searched whenever a persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo> is found. aim: To evaluate the performance of flow cytometry in etiologic diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Could it allow us to distinguish CLL from other causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo>? methods: Blood samples from 104 adult patients having a rate of lymphocytes&gt; 5000 élé/mm3 persisting more than three months were analyzed using a large panel of monoclonal antibodies in three colors and Cell Quest software. results: Lymphoproliferative B disorder was retained in 83 cases, including 50 cases of typical CLL with Matutes score≥ 4 and 12 cases of atypical CLL with Matutes score = 3  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were guided by the respective specific antigen expression CD103 and CD10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Large granular T <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (LGL-T) was the most common etiology of lymphoid T proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unusual cases of Natural Killer (NK) and NK/T proliferations were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: The Flow cytometry is a powerful tool to establish <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo> etiological diagnosis; it avoids invasive investigations in a large number of cases </plain></SENT>
