<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Among the diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of B-cell origin, we have encountered one variant displaying blastoid features that morphologically mimic lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the blastoid variant of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and the so-called blastoid transformation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To better characterize this entity, we studied eight cases morphologically, immunohistochemically, and by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for cytogenetic abnormalities commonly associated with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> exhibiting high-grade histological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eight cases were presented as de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, and displayed an entirely diffuse (five cases) or only minimal follicular (three cases) growth pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neoplastic lymphoid cells were of medium size with round nuclei, fine chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, and high mitotic rate; they expressed CD10, BCL6, and BCL2-a phenotype consistent with follicle center cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A proportion of cases expressed MUM1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their lack of TdT and CYCLIN D1 distinguished them from lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the blastoid mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neoplastic lymphoid cells consistently expressed CD43 (seven of eight cases) and occasionally other T-cell-associated antigens, including CD5, CD7, CD8, and CD57 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases overexpressed BCL2, t(14;18) was not detected in any of the five cases examined by FISH; instead, extra copies of chromosome 18 were found in four of five cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, other cytogenetic abnormalities, including structural abnormalities of BCL6 (allelic loss/gain, rearrangement), <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7, del(13)(q14), and MYC allelic loss, were frequently detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The combination of a B-cell CD10+ BCL6+ BCL2+ phenotype in the presence of structural abnormalities of BCL6 is consistent with a follicular center cell derivation for our cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The lack of t(14;18) seen in our cases, although rare in most cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, has been nevertheless reported in cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with a predominantly diffuse growth pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The molecular pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and prognostic significance of these lesions remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
