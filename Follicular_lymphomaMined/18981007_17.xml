<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to determine the CR rate with short-course chemoimmunotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, and rituximab (CHOP-R) followed by 90-Y ibritumomab tiuxetan (RIT) with extended rituximab as first-line treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Between March 2004 and February 2007, 60 patients with stage II to IV symptomatic or bulky FL from a single institution supported by a large community network entered this phase II trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received CHOP-R for three treatment cycles before RIT followed by four additional weekly treatments with rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Response was determined using fusion [(18) F] fluorodeoxyglucose-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 60 patients entering this trial, 55 patients completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> protocol therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median follow up was 19.7 months (range, 0.26-35.9 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For intent-to-treat analysis, the complete response (CR) rate after CHOP-R, as assessed by CT and PET imaging, was 40% and 46%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After RIT, the CR rate improved, as assessed by CT and PET imaging, to 82% and 89%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten patients have progressed, including eight from best response of CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven of 18 patients who were PET positive after CHOP-R progressed compared with 3 of 37 patients who were PET negative (P=0.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with previously untreated, symptomatic or bulky FL, short-course chemoimmunotherapy and consolidation RIT and extended rituximab resulted in a high CR rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Failure to achieve an early PET CR after CHOP-R indicated high risk of relapse </plain></SENT>
