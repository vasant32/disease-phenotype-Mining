<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18), which juxtaposes the immunoglobulin enhancer region from chromosome 14 to the bcl-2 gene on chromosome 18, is a recurrent cytogenetic abnormality in the majority of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This translocation results in overexpression of bcl-2, which increases cellular life span of the mutated cells by decreasing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18) also occurs in a subgroup of diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DLCL), and current thought is that the majority of these represent transformation of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Low grade FL are characterized by low proliferation, and diploid/peridiploid DNA content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared proliferative activity (PF) and DNA content (DI) in FL containing the t(14;18) to DLCL with and without the t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean PF and DI were lower in the NHL containing t(14;18) irregardless of histologic subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that increased life span due to the presence of t(14;18) provides the conditions for accumulation of a different set of mutations as compared to those NHL developing from mutations in more rapidly proliferating precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This has implications for prognosis of patients with DLCL depending upon the presence or absence of t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
