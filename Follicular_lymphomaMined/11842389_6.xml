<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown the safety and efficacy of the combination of FND (fludarabine/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>) in relapsed and subsequently untreated patients with stage IV indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, we treat patients with stage IV indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> who are previously untreated, younger than 60 years, human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus-negative, and have adequate organ and marrow function with FND and random assignment to concurrent or delayed administration of rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have developed a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With 1 microg of DNA, this assay detects 0.6 copies in 55% of reactions, as expected for the Poisson distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When 1microg of DNA was analyzed in duplicate, cells with the t(14;18) were detected in peripheral blood of 22% of 152 volunteer blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitation showed that numbers of t(14;18) cells were higher than the statistical upper <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limit (mean of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> volunteer values plus standard deviations) in 2% of volunteer blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, 36% of blood or marrow specimens from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients were positive, and the number of cells with t(14;18) was higher than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> upper limit in 26% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of cells with t(14;18) and their numbers are prospectively quantitated in blood and marrow of patients treated with FND plus rituximab to determine their clinical significance both at presentation and during therapy </plain></SENT>
