<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To assess the sensitivity of primary non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells to rituximab-mediated cytotoxicity, we compared the potency of several rituximab-mediated killing mechanisms on fresh <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells tested were equally sensitive to antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-mediated phagocytosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, and rituximab-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, they were differentially lysed by complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that taking into account both CD20 and complement regulatory protein expression on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells could predict CDC sensitivity in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the sensitivity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells to CDC was consistent with the reported different clinical response rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>: rituximab induced high CDC killing of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, whereas mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were moderately sensible to CDC, and small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> resistant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We propose that CDC is a determinant mechanism of rituximab-induced killing in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Poor sensitivity to CDC in vitro might predict a poor clinical response, whereas high sensitivity to CDC would only indicate a likelihood of response to rituximab treatment </plain></SENT>
