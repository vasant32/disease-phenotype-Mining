<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five patients with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosed between 1968 and 1975 were followed up for long periods and were treated by either conventional methods (local radiotherapy and single drug chemotherapy) or by more intensive therapeutic regimens, such as initial combined M.O.P.P. therapy and maintenance treatment with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> with or without further courses of M.O.P.P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-ups have brought to light some interesting points concerning the prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dissemination of the disease and large-cell histological pattern were, as already known, unfavourable factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neither age nor sex, nor bone-marrow involvement seemed to have any influence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Obtaining complete remissions improved the prognosis, but intensifying the initial and maintenance treatments proved disappointing: the survival rate remained the same, and the incidence of drug induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, relapses appeared to be less responsive to treatment when the patient had initially received multiple chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in view of the high <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate of the disease (one-third of the patients in this series died within the first 5 years), trying new therapeutic regimens in the hope of obtaining better results, as has been done in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, would be fully justified </plain></SENT>
