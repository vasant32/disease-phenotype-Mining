<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But its relevance to adult T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ATL) remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To better understand the role of pRB in ATL, we examined the expression and phosphorylation status of pRB in three ATL cell lines and 43 clinical samples, eight peripheral blood samples and 35 lymph node samples, from patients with ATL by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, 30 lymph node sections were also evaluated immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a result, Western blotting analysis revealed that the pRB in the ATL cell lines was in the hyperphosphorylated, but that in 39 of 43 clinical samples, pRB was exclusively in the hypophosphorylated form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four peripheral blood samples were negative for pRB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed that the lymph nodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of 30 patients tested were positive for pRB at various staining levels, weak, mild, and strong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>But weak expression may be essentially negative for pRB function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with weak pRB expression in their lymph nodes lived significantly shorter lives than those with mild expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, patients with strong expression also showed a significantly worse prognosis than those with mild expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although only the absence of pRB expression was considered previously to be indicative of RB functional loss, it has been reported recently that overexpression of pRB is correlated with progression of disease in patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002862'>bladder carcinoma</z:hpo> or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that pRB controls <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> proliferation not only as a cell cycle regulator but also by other mechanisms, possibly through the inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, as suggested by recent findings in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002669'>osteosarcoma</z:hpo> cell line, Saos-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, pRB may play an essential role in its hypophosphorylated form for progression of ATL, as well as a cell cycle promoter in hyperphosphorylated or negative/excessive reduced form </plain></SENT>
