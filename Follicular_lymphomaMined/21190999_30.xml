<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Next-generation sequencing of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse-large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has revealed frequent somatic, heterozygous Y641 mutations in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> methyltransferase EZH2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Heterozygosity and the presence of equal quantities of both mutant and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and expressed protein suggest a dominant mode of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples harboring heterozygous EZH2(Y641) mutations have increased levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 Lys-27-specific trimethylation (H3K27me3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of EZH2(Y641F/N) mutants in cells with EZH2(WT) resulted in an increase of H3K27me3 levels in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Structural modeling of EZH2(Y641) mutants suggests a "Tyr/Phe switch" model whereby structurally neutral, nontyrosine residues at position 641 would decrease affinity for unmethylated and monomethylated H3K27 substrates and potentially favor trimethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate, using in vitro enzyme assays of reconstituted PRC2 complexes, that Y641 mutations result in a decrease in monomethylation and an increase in trimethylation activity of the enzyme relative to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This represents the first example of a disease-associated gain-of-function mutation in a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> methyltransferase, whereby somatic EZH2 Y641 mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> act dominantly to increase, rather than decrease, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The dominant mode of action suggests that allele-specific EZH2 inhibitors should be a future therapeutic strategy for this disease </plain></SENT>
