<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From 1994 to 1999, we performed ASCT with immunologically purged progenitor cells in 15 patients with advanced stage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) after early partial or complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results of the purging strategy and follow-up of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> after transplant were analyzed with PCR amplification of bcl-2/IgH rearrangement for the t(14;18) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A comparison of transplanted patients with a group of controls was carried out to evaluate differences in progression-free survival and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty percent of patients received one chemotherapy regimen before ASCT and were in first remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> plus hyperfractionated total body irradiation as the conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine patients were transplanted with bone marrow (BM) and six with peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Engraftment was delayed in one patient transplanted with BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients died during the transplant procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten of 12 evaluable patients were PCR positive in the BM for bcl-2 rearrangement at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six of them (60%) were still positive after chemotherapy, and one patient was transplanted with a positive hematopoietic product after purging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 27 months, six of eight evaluable patients still remain PCR negative in the BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 4.7 years from diagnosis, progression-free survival was 83% (95% CI: 63-100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The risk of disease progression of non-transplanted patients was 19.2 times higher than that of transplanted patients (P = 0.01), but no differences were found in overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Regarding patients in first remission, the risk of relapse was 12.6 times higher in non-transplanted than in transplanted patients (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This procedure seems to offer a good chance to achieve a PCR-negative state and prolonged freedom from recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>According to these results, prospective randomized trials are warranted </plain></SENT>
