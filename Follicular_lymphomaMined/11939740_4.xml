<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded bone marrow core biopsy specimens with lymphoid aggregates were stained using primary antibodies directed against bcl-2, bcl-6, CD5, CD10, CD20, and CD23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 61 cases (26 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 35 benign or atypical aggregates) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that no single stain is sufficient for identification of neoplastic lymphoid aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, this distinction was made possible by using a panel of antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Under the conditions we tested, the most useful antibodies were CD10, bcl-2, CD5, and CD20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most benign or atypical aggregates do not express CD10 and CD23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, nonneoplastic aggregates had a large population of T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>bcl-2 was useful in an architectural context for distinguishing neoplastic aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>bcl-6 often was expressed in both neoplastic and nonneoplastic aggregates and, thus, poorly discriminated between these processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We studied the expression of CD10 and bcl-6 in selected lymph nodes in some cases </plain></SENT>
