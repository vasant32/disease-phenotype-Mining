<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The functional immunoglobulin (Ig) genes of B lymphocytes undergo <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> during immune responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These mutations modify the antigen binding site of the immunoglobulins, thereby enhancing the average affinity of the antibodies produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanism underlying these B cell hypermutations remains unresolved, partly because it is difficult to grow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells in long-term cell cultures and because there is no suitable transformed or malignant B cell line which generates mutations in its immunoglobulin genes in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that the recently established follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line HF-1.3.4 generates somatic hypermutations in vitro at a high frequency of 0.7 x 10(-6) mutations per base pair per generation in standard cell cultures (RPMI 1640 + 5% fetal calf serum) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This shows for the first time that B cell hypermutation can occur without T cells or T cell factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mutation frequency increased approximately tenfold to 1 x 10(-5) mutations/base pair/generation with B cell-specific growth factors (interleukins-2 and -4 and three antibodies stimulatory to HF-1.3.4 cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This HF-1.3.4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line may help to elucidate the molecular mechanism of Ig gene hypermutation </plain></SENT>
