<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied mantle B-cell and T-cell ingression in hyperplastic follicles (HFs), follicular lysis (FL), and progressive transformation of germinal centers (PTGC) in 19 paraffin-embedded, H&amp;E-, bcl-2-, CD20-, and CD3-stained lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We enumerated the T cells (CD3+) and mantle B cells (bcl-2+/CD3-) per 100 cells in 5 high-power fields of each entity (mean +/- SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared with HF, FL had increased numbers of T cells migrating into germinal centers (39.8 +/- 10.0 vs 25.8 +/- 7.8; P &lt; .0001). and a mild increase of mantle B cells (12.3 +/- 11.4 vs 2.1 +/- 1.6; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PTGC showed an increase of T-cell ingression compared with HF (36.5 +/- 12.1 vs 25.8 +/- 7.8; P &lt; .0001) and more migration of mantle B cells into the follicle than FL (41.0 +/- 22.5 vs 12.3 +/- 11.4; P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T cells and mantle B cells ingress in FL and PTGC, although the mantle B-cell component predominates in the latter, suggesting that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo>, FL, and PTGC constitute an evolutionary spectrum in resolution of <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> with sequential ingression of T cells followed by mantle B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maintenance of bcl-2 expression in mantle B cells in PTGC may cause differential diagnostic pitfalls in florid PTGC vs follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, particularly the so-called floral variant </plain></SENT>
