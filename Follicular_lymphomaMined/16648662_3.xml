<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy revealed a flat elevated lesion about 15 mm in diameter adjacent to the duodenal papilla, the surface of which was uneven and covered with whitish granules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of histological examination with immunohistochemistry (positive for CD10, CD20, CD79a, and bcl-2 protein, negative for CD5 and cyclin D1), a diagnosis of grade 1/3 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Systemic staging examinations suggested the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was restricted to the mucosa and superficial portion of the submucosa in the duodenal wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with a combination of CHOP chemotherapy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>) and monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab), in addition to radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After six courses of this combination chemotherapy, complete regression of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although reports of small duodenal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (&lt;20 mm or localized to the mucosa or submucosa) are extremely rare, the features of this case are characteristic of small duodenal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in terms of evolution around the ampulla of Vater, low-grade follicular type, occurrence in a women, occurrence in the fourth decade of life, and favorable outcome, and this type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> may need to be distinguished by pathogenesis and clinical behavior from various other gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
