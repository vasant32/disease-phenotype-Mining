<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 49 first-line LTBFL patients who received weekly doses of rituximab (375 mg/m(2)), 46 have been followed with a long-term analysis of clinical and molecular responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Best clinical response (at any staging within a year following treatment) was 80%, 24 (52%) patients had complete or unconfirmed complete response, 13 (28%) had partial response and 9 (20%) had stable or progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 31 patients having a positive bcl2-JH rearrangement, 15 (48%) became negative following treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 83.9 months of follow-up (95% confidence interval 6.4-92.8 months), the median progression-free survival is 23.5 months and overall survival (OS) is 91.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients died (one progression, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, one diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (15%) are progression-free including five who are bcl2 informative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No unexpected long-term adverse event has been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of patients remain progression-free 7 years after a single 4-dose rituximab treatment in first-line LTBFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 7-year overall survivalOS is very high in this selected population of patients </plain></SENT>
