<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But endoscopic semiotics and diagnostic of those lesions is elaborated insufficiently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of our investigation was working out of non-Hodgkin's gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> endoscopic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examinated 250 patients with gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, from those primary and secondary lesions were in 160 (64%) cases and 90 (36%) cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients was performed standard videoendoscopy, which included magnified endoscopy with NBI (Narrow Band Imaging), followed by chromoendoscopy with indigocarmine (0.4% solution) and EUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was confirmed by <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to our observations gastroenterological pathology duration to diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was very variable: diagnosis was established during first 3 months in 30.6% cases (49 patients), during 6 month in 18.1% cases (29 patients), from 6 to 12 months in 15.6% cases (25 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Separately should was noted, that almost in one third cases primary gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was diagnosed after one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Macroscopic form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038356" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastric tumor</z:e> was represented by follow variants: exophytic--22 cases (8.8%), infiltrative--54 cases (21.6%), ulcerous--37 cases (14.8%), infiltrative-ulcerous--71 cases (28.4%), similar to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo>--36 cases (14.4%), mixed--30 cases (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The second endpoint of our work was detection of macroscopic features depending on morphological variant of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analysis of represented data demonstrated prevalence similar to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo> form (33.4%) for MALT-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, infiltrative-ulcerous form as for diffuse large-cell B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of MALT-type, as for diffuse large-cell B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>--45.0% and 41.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Infiltrative form was more often in group of patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>--31.8%, and ulcerous form predominated for Burkett's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>--60.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION; Were established the most informative endoscopic criteria for diagnosis non-Hodgkin's gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
