<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Single cell studies aimed at clarifying the nature and clonality of Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells of classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) have so far produced conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using an improved single cell procedure, the HRS cells of 25 patients with nodular sclerosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> lacking B- and T-cell antigens, with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epstein-Barr virus infection</z:e>, were analyzed for the presence of immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> developed follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 2 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> originated from a common precursor identified as a germinal center B cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data show that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one of the investigated cases harbored rearranged Ig genes, which were clonal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> instances and carried a high load of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Ig coding capacity was preserved in 18 of the 24 cases (75%) with rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, expression of Ig <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> was not detectable in the HRS cells with the exception of Ig kappa light chain expression in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells of 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lack of Ig gene transcription in HRS cells was confirmed by analyzing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> cell lines L428 and KM-H2 in transient transfection experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An Ig promoter/enhancer reporter construct showed virtually no activity in these cells compared to 5 control B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that (1) classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> is a B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in most instances, (2) HRS cells are clonal without any exception, (3) they are derived from germinal center B-cells that (4) mostly lack crippling mutations but (5) have consistently lost their Ig gene transcription ability, due to functional defects in the Ig gene regulatory elements </plain></SENT>
