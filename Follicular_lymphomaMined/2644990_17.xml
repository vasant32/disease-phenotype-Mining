<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNAs from 30 Japanese patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were examined for the molecular features by Southern blot hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using probe b for the major breakpoint cluster region of a bcl-2 gene, the rearrangements were detected in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six of the eight patients had breakpoints located within the major breakpoint region, while two had breakpoints outside this cluster region but within the region of the 7.5-kb SstI fragment containing the probe b sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two patients, pFL-2 probe detected the bcl-2 gene rearrangements that occurred near or within the minor breakpoint cluster region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These ten patients had a rearranged JH-containing fragment that migrated with the rearranged bcl-2 fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the other 20 patients, these two chromosome 18-specific DNA probes did not detect the bcl-2 rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with studies performed in the United States, the statistical analysis indicates a significant difference in frequency of the bcl-2 gene rearrangements near or within the major breakpoint cluster region (P = 0.0027) and the minor breakpoint cluster region (P = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the distribution difference of these events was not significant </plain></SENT>
