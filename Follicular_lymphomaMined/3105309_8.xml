<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Southern blotting was employed to analyze the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes and the gene for the T cell receptor beta chain in genomic DNA derived from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specimens of 120 adults with pathologically classified and immunotyped non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a consecutive series of 100 patients, one or two rearranged heavy chain genes could be detected in each of the 80 samples expressing clonal surface immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The kappa gene was rearranged in 70 percent of kappa-bearing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and in 23 percent of lambda-bearing specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a rearranged immunoglobulin gene was also observed in 21 of 29 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (nine from the consecutive series and 20 selected for surface immunoglobulin-negative status) in which B cell lineage was in doubt because of absent clonal surface immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that most cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in adults are of B cell lineage, even when phenotypic evidence is inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The exceptional cases (only 3 percent in the consecutive series) were of either follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or diffuse large cell (histiocytic) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtype; the lineage in cases of diffuse lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> was never in doubt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the convenience of surface marker analysis assures its continuing clinical application, gene study resolves indeterminate cases and extends the understanding of the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
