<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We present findings concerning (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) at end-treatment evaluation in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) in order to establish possible predictive factors for progression-free survival (PFS) and patient outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data from 91 consecutive FL patients (M:F = 51:40, mean age 61) referred to our PET Unit at therapy completion: 38 with an indolent form (grade 1-2) and 53 with an aggressive FL (grade 3a and b) according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 148 FDG PET/CT scans were analysed and findings reported as positive or negative for disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall response to treatment was assessed according to the revised International Workshop Criteria (IWC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The final outcome was defined as remission or disease by taking clinical, instrumental and histological data as standards of reference, with a mean follow-up period of 3 years (range 1-8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A statistical analysis was performed with respect to PFS and patient outcome for FDG PET result, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> grading, Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI), disease stage and number of relapses, on uni- and multivariate analyses, with p &lt; 0.05 considered as significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall patients presented a mean PFS of 35 months (range 3-86), with a relapse rate of 42% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At final outcome, remission was achieved in 67 of 91 patients (74%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the different predictive factors, only FDG PET result significantly correlated with patient outcome (p = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PET/CT performance at the end of treatment was as follows: 100% sensitivity, 99% specificity, 89% positive predictive value and 100% negative predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a statistically significant correlation with PFS for FDG PET (p &lt; 0.0001), FLIPI score (0-1 versus ≥ 2) (p = 0.0451) and number of relapses (none versus ≥ 1) (p = 0.0058) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings were confirmed at the univariate analysis, whereas at the multivariate analysis only FDG PET (p = 0.0006892) and number of relapses (p = 0.01947) were independent predictive factors for PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: End-treatment PET/CT in FL has high accuracy and appears to be a good predictor of PFS and patient outcome, irrespective of grading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>As expected, patients facing more than one relapse seem to have significantly shorter PFS in the presence of a positive FDG PET </plain></SENT>
