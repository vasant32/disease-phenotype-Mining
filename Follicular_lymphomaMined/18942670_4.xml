<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Although much is known about the efficacy, toxicity, and direct costs of treatment for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), there is no data assessing the impact of this diagnosis on the work productivity of affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey study of consecutive patients attending a malignant haematology clinic at a large multi-disciplinary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with a diagnosis of FL or other indolent non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> completed questionnaires assessing health status, work productivity, and activity impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-four patients completed the survey study (95% response) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who continued to work reported a minimal impact on their work productivity (10%+/-standard deviation SD 20; 0%=no effect and 100%=complete impairment of activity) and on their daily activities (13%+/-SD 25) attributable to their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosis, over 71% of patients were working while 14% were retired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the time of survey administration, only 41% of patients were still able to work with a significant proportion of patients having transitioned to retirement (36%), sick leave (10%), or unemployment (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, significant activity impairment (daily activity impairment&gt;50%) was predicted by poor self-rated health status (OR 32.1; 95% CI: 5.9-174.2; p&lt;0.0001) and active chemotherapy treatment (OR 14.5; 95% CI: 0.91-230.9; p=0.059) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although few patients with indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> identified significant impairment in productivity, many were unable to continue employment following diagnosis, needed to miss days from work, or imposed a significant burden on caregivers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The greatest impact on activity is apparent in patients who rate their health status as poor and in those who are currently receiving systemic therapy </plain></SENT>
