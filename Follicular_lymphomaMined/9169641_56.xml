<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Similar effects have been postulated to contribute to the decreased recurrence rate observed after allogeneic transplantation in non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This lower recurrence rate may be due to a variety of other mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the role of graft-versus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> effects in patients in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> recur after allogeneic transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the time of recurrence, immunosuppressive therapy was withheld </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with non-responding disease received an infusion of donor lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were observed for response and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disease in four of nine patients responded to withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A minor response was observed in one of three recipients of donor lymphocyte infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Responses were observed among two patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, one with large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and one with lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A minor response was observed in a patient with prolymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy and donor lymphocyte infusion can induce durable remissions in patients with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> after allogeneic transplantation </plain></SENT>
