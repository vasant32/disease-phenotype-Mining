<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-two patients (median age, 64 years; 79% stage III/IV, one to nine prior treatments) received four once-weekly doses of 80 to 750 mg/m(2) of veltuzumab and were assessed for safety, efficacy, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Veltuzumab was well tolerated, with no grade 3 to 4 drug-related adverse events despite short infusion times (typically 2 hours initially, 1 hour subsequently at doses &lt; 375 mg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 24 (44%) of 55 patients had objective responses (OR), with 15 (27%) complete responses (CRs) or CRs unconfirmed (CRus) by International Working Group criteria, and with some responses occurring despite two to five prior rituximab-containing regimens, less favorable prognosis (elevated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> &gt; 5 cm, and Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index &gt; or = 2), and at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dose levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CRs/CRus were durable (median duration, 19.7 months), with five patients still ongoing (15.9 to 37.6 months duration) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, five (83%) of six patients had ORs, with two CRs/CRus (33%), and in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, three (43%) of seven patients achieved partial responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dose levels studied, B cells were depleted after the first infusion, veltuzumab serum half-lives were similar after the fourth infusion, and mean antibody serum levels exceeded values considered important for anti-CD20 therapy (ie, 25 microg/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Veltuzumab appeared safe and active at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tested doses, encouraging further study, including dose levels less than those typically used with rituximab </plain></SENT>
