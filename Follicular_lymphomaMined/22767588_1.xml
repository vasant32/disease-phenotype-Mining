<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study explored the efficacy and safety of rituximab as treatment of clinical or molecular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> after autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients with CD20+ FL and clinically (group A, n = 14) or clono-specific PCR-detectable (group B, n = 25) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> persisting 3 months after ASCT received rituximab 375 mg/m&amp;sup2; once weekly for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Response rate at day 50 was 36% [90% confidence interval (CI) 15-61] in group A (World Health Organization criteria) and 52% (90% CI 34-70) in group B (conversion PCR-undetectable status to undetectable status) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The best response rate was 71% [nine complete responses (CRs) and one partial response] in group A and 76% in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 36 months, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 responses persisted in group A, whereas 46% of patients in group B still had PCR-undetectable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 68% of patients in group B were still in clinical CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rituximab after ASCT was safe with few grade 3-4 toxic effects (15% patients), mainly <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> reactions and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Rituximab induced a high rate of durable CRs in patients with clinically detectable disease, as well as durable eradication of PCR-detectable disease in patients with FL after ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Continued molecular responses assessed with a highly sensitive and clono-specific PCR technique were correlated with an excellent disease control </plain></SENT>
