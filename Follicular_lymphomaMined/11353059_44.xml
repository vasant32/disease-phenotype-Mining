<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed 139 consecutive FNABS of 84 primary and 55 recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FCM was successful in 105 (75%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall results, including cases without FCM, included 93/139 (67%) true positive, 7 (5%) false negative, and 39 indeterminate (27 [19%] suspicious and 12 [9%] atypical) diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cases with FCM, there were 80/105 (77%) true positive, no false negative, and 25 indeterminate diagnoses (15 [14%] suspicious and 10 [9%] atypical) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall results of the 84 primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were 55 (67%) true positive, 5 (5%) false negative, and 24 indeterminate (14[16%] suspicious and 10 [12%] atypical) diagnoses for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 68 primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> analyzed with FCM, 50 [74%] were true positives, and 28 were indeterminate (11 [16%] suspicious and 7 [10%] atypical) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no false negatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic accuracy varied among <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subclassification of the positive cases were initially conclusive in only 55/93 cases (59%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, a retrospective review of the morphologic together with FCM data in 15 of the 23 unclassified cases improved the overall subclassification of positive cases to 77% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Subclassification was best in small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Subclassification was poor in marginal-zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (33%), and initially as well in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (62%), but it improved on review (95%), as did subclassification of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (77 to 100% on review) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> was recognized as malignant in only 44% of the cases (7/16) and was classified as such based on <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This review of our early efforts to diagnose and subclassify <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with FNAB and FCM indicates that although a diagnosis and proper subclassification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> can be made with certainty in the majority of cases, recurrent or primary, it requires close coordination of cytomorphology and immunophenotyping data, which often comes with close cooperation of cytopathologists and hematopathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A mere cytological diagnosis of positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is no longer acceptable if FNAB is to become an independent diagnostic tool for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
