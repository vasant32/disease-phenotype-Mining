<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were correlated with histology, stage, and clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, especially diffuse histiocytic (large cell) (DHL), were associated with decreased absolute lymphocytes and E-rosette forming cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Skin test reactivity varied with both histology and stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For example, only one of six tests was impaired in diffuse lymphocytic well differentiated (DLWD) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in contrast to two of six in localized DHL and five of six in advanced DHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> exhibited depressed mean levels of IgA and IgG, while only IgA was significantly decreased in diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">Mitogen</z:chebi> stimulation was depressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, although mixed lymphocyte cultures did not differ significantly from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, there is a spectrum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> of both B and T cell type in patients with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that correlated with histology and stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Implications and possible mechanisms of these observations are discussed </plain></SENT>
