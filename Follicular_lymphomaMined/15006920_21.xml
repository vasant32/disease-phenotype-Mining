<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In recent decades, the incidence of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) has increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> industrialized countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tobacco smoke contains several recognized or putative carcinogenic compounds that differ in concentration depending on which of the two main types, blond or black, is consumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This investigation sought to evaluate the association between NHL and type of tobacco smoked (blond, black, or mixed), focusing on the Working Formulation (WF) subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Reanalysis of Italian data from a recent multicenter population-based case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 1450 cases of NHL and 1779 healthy controls from 11 Italian areas with different demographic and productive characteristics were included in the study, corresponding to approximately 7 million residents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) adjusted for age, gender, residence area, educational level, and type of interview were estimated by unconditional logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A statistically significant association [OR = 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-1.7] was found for blond tobacco exposure and NHL risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A dose-response relationship was limited to men younger than 52 years (chi(2) for trend = 9.95, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subjects starting smoking at an early age showed a higher risk in men younger than 65 years, whereas no clear trend was evident for the other age and gender subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The analysis by WF categories showed the highest risks for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in blond (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.4-3.2) and mixed (OR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0) tobacco smokers and for large cell within the other WF group (OR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.4) only for blond tobacco </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Smoking blond tobacco could be a risk factor for NHL, especially follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
