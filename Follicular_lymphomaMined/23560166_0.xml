<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The representative endoscopic features of primary intestinal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are well known as small whitish polypoid nodules, but a magnified view has only been described in a few case reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein, we report a case with intestinal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in which magnifying endoscopy with narrow band imaging was helpful for prompt diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 57-year-old Japanese woman underwent surveillance esophagogastroduodenoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The endoscopic examination revealed confluent whitish granules in the duodenum, distinct from the nodules or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> that are typical findings of intestinal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnifying endoscopy visualized whitish enlarged villi, and narrow band imaging emphasized an elongated and coiled vascular pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on these features, intestinal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was highly suspected, and subsequent histological study confirmed the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case demonstrates that magnifying endoscopy with narrow band imaging was useful for the detection and prompt diagnosis of intestinal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pathological features of intestinal follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are also discussed </plain></SENT>
