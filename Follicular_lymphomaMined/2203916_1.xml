<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using three chromosome 18-specific DNAs, rearrangements of a bcl-2 gene were detected in 20 (44%) of 45 Japanese patients (pts) with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) and 3 (8%) of 36 pts with diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 21 pts had t (IgH; bcl-2), and of the remaining two who did not display it, one had chromosome t(14; 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared with the findings in American pts, the lower frequency of t(14; 18)-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> could reflect a difference in the incidence of overall nodal B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> between Japan and the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>11 of 18 pts with t(14; 18)-positive FL expressed CD10 antigen on the cell surface and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 pts with t(14; 18)-negative FL did not, and the difference is statistically significant, indicating that t(14; 18)-positive Japanese FL is the same disease entity as most of American FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extra 18q- chromosome found in the advanced grade diseases of t(14; 18)-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> results in amplification of the rearranged bcl-2 gene on 18q-, suggesting that the change is closely associated with transformation of FL carrying t(14; 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is thus possible of international realization to institute the prognostic factors and the treatment strategy for conquering t(14; 18)-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
