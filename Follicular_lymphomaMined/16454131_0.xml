<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This descriptive study was carried out at the Aga Khan University Hospital pathology department including 1721 cases of Non-Hodgkins <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) diagnosed during a period of five years (1998-2002) and classified according to REAL/WHO classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antibodies used included Leukocyte Common Antigen (LCA), Pan B (CD20, CD79a), Pan T (UCHL-1), Bcl 2, Mib 1(Ki 67) and Cyclin D1 (Dako, Denmark) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of the 1721 NHL cases, only 140 (8.1%) could be categorized as small B-cell NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study group comprised small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (58 cases; 41.4%) followed by follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (46 cases; 32.9%), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (15 cases; 10.7%), extra nodal marginal zone B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of MALT type (15 cases; 10.7%), lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (5 cases; 3.6%) and splenic marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1 case; 0.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No case of nodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The age ranged from 18 to 98 years with a mean and median of 54.64 and 58.50 years respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Small B-cell NHL was more common in males; with male to female ratio of 2.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Majority of the small B-cell NHL were nodal at presentation with a nodal to extranodal ratio of 3.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the frequency of these small B-cell NHL is very low in our population in contrast to the western literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies based on epidemiologic and etiological factors are required to look into this marked difference of occurrence of these indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
