<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data were obtained from the National Comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Network Non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Outcomes database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who presented between 1 January 2001 and 30 September 2009 with newly diagnosed grade 1-2 FL, with at least 6 months of follow-up, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified 953 eligible patients and 532 (56%) underwent FDG-PET as part of initial staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among patients who underwent FDG-PET for initial staging, 438 (82%) received early treatment compared to 259 (61.5%) of those staged without FDG-PET (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with stage I FL (n = 100), 47% were treated with radiotherapy (RT) alone, and the choice of initial treatment strategy for stage I FL did not vary significantly by use of FDG-PET (p = 0.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The use of FDG-PET for staging of FL is widespread and is associated with a greater proportion of patients receiving early therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Given the widespread use and high cost of FDG-PET, its clinical utility in stage I FL should be further evaluated </plain></SENT>
