<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background Introduction of the monoclonal antibody rituximab to chemotherapy regimens has substantially improved disease-free and overall survival in patients with non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The short-term safety of this drug has been widely reported, but there are few data on long-term safety, which suggests that these patients require prolonged follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aim of the review To review the literature on follow-up models, with a focus on the safety of rituximab therapy for diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Method The Cochrane Library, Embassy, Lilacs, Medline, and Scirus databases were searched for systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, textbooks and journals on pharmaceutical care and institutional websites were searched for patient management recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outcomes were follow-up models and grade 3, 4, and 5 adverse reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results Five systematic reviews and eight clinical trials or updates describing patient follow-up or reporting adverse reactions were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only one systematic review and seven clinical trials reported follow-up routines for patients receiving rituximab, including information on staging, frequency of reassessment, and laboratory tests, as well as pre-infusion care and management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or delayed adverse reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five systematic reviews and four clinical trials reported data on statistically significant adverse reactions (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four guidelines or institutional protocols for treatment and follow-up were identified, as well as seven studies describing experiences in the implementation of pharmaceutical care for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> patients, but none were specifically focused on follow-up of patients receiving rituximab for NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusion Although some systematic reviews and clinical trials contain guidance on follow-up of patients receiving rituximab for NHL, there are no validated strategies for systematic follow-up of these patients with a focus on safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As there are few data on long-term safety profile of these novel treatments, monitoring strategies should be developed and implemented to ensure safe and optimized use of drugs recently added to the therapeutic arsenal of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
