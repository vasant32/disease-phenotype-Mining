<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Documentation of spontaneous regression by serial fluorodeoxyglucose-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging has not been reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present 3 cases of spontaneous regression, 1 each of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>), and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), which showed spontaneous regression on serial FDG-PET imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent serial whole-body FDG-PET scans 60 minutes after intravenous injection of 9-11 mCi of this radiotracer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of them had any chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery after the baseline PET scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous regression of disease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 cases was correlated with conventional imaging and clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 patients had positive FDG-PET results on their baseline scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was complete disappearance of FDG uptake on a follow-up PET scan for the patient with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest complete regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> both showed a significant reduction in FDG uptake on serial whole-body PET scans, suggesting partial regression in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although spontaneous regression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is uncommon, this phenomenon can be successfully demonstrated by FDG-PET imaging </plain></SENT>
