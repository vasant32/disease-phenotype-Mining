<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Commonly, both BM histology as well as flow cytometry (FCM) of BM aspirates are performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to compare the diagnostic value of these two techniques, we retrospectively evaluated trephine BM biopsies and listmode data of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of FL, obtained in parallel during a 5-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred and thirty nine specimens from 91 patients with FL were eligible for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After joint review, nine cases (6.5%) were reclassified, either in histology (six cases) or FCM (three cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy nine specimens (57%) showed no infiltration with both methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixty specimens (43%) were scored positive for BM involvement by any of the two techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concordant positive results were obtained in 41 cases (68% of positive BM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>False negative results were obtained by FCM in 14 cases (23% of positive BM) and by histology in five cases (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Discrepant results between BM histology and FCM are frequent in patients with FL, most likely due to the predominantly paratrabecular infiltration and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> typical for FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Due to the lower false negative rate, trephine BM biopsy remains crucial for the detection of BM involvement in FL </plain></SENT>
