<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The architectural arrangement of the neoplastic cells and their cytologic identification form the histologic basis of the Rappaport classification of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> clinical studies have shown the favorable prognosis of the nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> while the diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> irrespective of cell type have a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several recent studies have shown that pathologists can identify the nodular and diffuse patterns with a high degree of reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cytologic subclassification has, however, not achieved a similar high degree of reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Southwest <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group study has shown the most reproducible subgroups to be the nodular poorly differentiated lymphocytic malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ML) and the diffuse histiocytic ML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of the Rappaport classification when applied to childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is not as clear as in adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In view of the recent description of a new clinicopathologic entity primarily in children and adolescents (ie, lymphoblastic ML), IT IS APPARENT THAT THE CHILDHOOD LYMPHOMAS Will have to be examined more critically in order to determine the clinical significance of this classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although some have proposed new classifications of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> based upon immunologic identification of cell origin, none have been shown to be of clinical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on recent immunologic and clinical studies, a modified classification of the non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is proposed which does not alter its clinical usefulness </plain></SENT>
