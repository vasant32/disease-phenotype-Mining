<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), the majority of translocations involve the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGH) locus, while a few involve the immunoglobulin light chain gene (IGL) locus, consisting of the kappa light chain gene (IGkappa) and the lambda light chain gene (IGlambda) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although many reports have dealt with the translocation and/or amplification of IGH in NHL, only a few have identified IGL translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify cytogenetic abnormalities and the partner chromosomes of IGL translocations in NHL, we performed dual-colour fluorescence in situ hybridisation (DC-FISH) and spectral karyotyping (SKY) in seven NHL cell lines and 40 patients with NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We detected IGL translocations in two cell lines and nine patients: four patients with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, three with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, one with extranodal marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and one with mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five distinct partners of IGlambda translocation were identified by SKY analysis: 3q27 in three patients, and 1p13, 6p25, 17p11.2 and 17q21 in one patient each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three cases featured double translocations of IGH and IGL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings warrant the identification of novel genes 1p13, 6p25, 17p11.2 and 17q21 </plain></SENT>
