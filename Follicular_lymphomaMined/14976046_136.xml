<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received standard treatment (rituximab 375 mg/m(2) weekly x 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 185 evaluable patients, the overall response rate was 67% in chemotherapy-naive patients and 46% in pretreated cases (P &lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients responding or with stable disease at week 12 (n = 151) were randomized to no further treatment or prolonged rituximab administration (375 mg/m(2) every 2 months for 4 times) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 35 months, the median event-free survival (EFS) was 12 months in the no further treatment versus 23 months in the prolonged treatment arm (P =.02), the difference being particularly notable in chemotherapy-naive patients (19 vs 36 months; P =.009) and in patients responding to induction treatment (16 vs 36 months; P =.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of t(14;18)-positive cells in peripheral blood (P =.0035) and in bone marrow (P =.0052) at baseline was predictive for clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Circulating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B lymphocytes and immunoglobulin M (IgM) plasma levels decreased for a significantly longer time after prolonged treatment, but the incidence of adverse events was not increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with FL, the administration of 4 additional doses of rituximab at 8-week intervals significantly improves the EFS </plain></SENT>
