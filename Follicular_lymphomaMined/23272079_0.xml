<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Limited information exists regarding expression profiles and the prognostic role of BAFF and BAFF-R in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the expression profiles of BAFF and BAFF-R in FL and to evaluate the correlation of BAFF and BAFF-R expression with clinicopathologic characteristics and outcome of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlation between expression levels of BAFF detected by immunohistochemical (IHC) and serum levels of BAFF was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Paraffin-embedded specimens from 115 patients were immunohistochemically examined for BAFF and BAFF-R expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression levels were dichotomized into low versus high categories based on immunostaining intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The correlation of BAFF and BAFF-R expression with clinicopathologic characteristics and patient outcome was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of BAFF in 35 of the 115 patients with IHC data were measured by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BAFF and BAFF-R were expressed in 88.7% (102/115) and 87.8% (101/115) of the cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BAFF expression was significantly correlated with only one clinicopathologic feature: Ann Arbor stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was found between expression levels of BAFF detected by IHC and serum levels of BAFF detected by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>High expression of BAFF-R, but not BAFF, was significantly correlated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS; P = 0.013) and overall survival (OS; P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>High expression of BAFF-R, bulky disease, and elevated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase were correlated with inferior PFS and OS in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A prognostic scoring system incorporating these 3 risk factors identified 3 distinct prognostic groups with 5-year PFS of 59.4%, 41.9%, and 10.7% and OS of 91.3%, 79.7%, and 45.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with FL variably express BAFF and BAFF-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>High expression of BAFF-R, but not BAFF, may be an independent risk factor for PFS and OS in FL </plain></SENT>
