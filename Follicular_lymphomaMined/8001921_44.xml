<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined 60 FLs by the PCR to determine optimal primer selection for detection of clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH) rearrangements in this common group of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each primer set included a 3' IgH joining region consensus primer; the 5' primer was different in each reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first-line panel included the following: Set 1, bcl-2 major breakpoint region (mbr) primer; Set 2, bcl-2 minor cluster region (mcr) primer; Set 3, IgH variable region framework III consensus primer; and Set 4, seven separate IgH variable region framework I family-specific primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A reserve panel also was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The efficiency of monoclonal B-cell population amplification differed among primer sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2-targeted primer pairs (Sets 1 and 2) were most efficient and amplified 42 (70%) of 60 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, the mbr and mcr primer sets detected monoclonality in 38 and four cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Set 3 amplified monoclonal B-cell in 38 and four cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Set 3 amplified monoclonal B-cell populations in 31 (52%) cases and Set 4 detected similar populations in only 27 (45%) samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When results from primer Sets 1, 2, and 3 were combined, 49 of 60 (82%) FLs showed evidence of B-cell monoclonality by the PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three of the 11 negative cases were documented as monoclonal with primer Set 4, and three additional samples were amplified only with our reserve panel.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
