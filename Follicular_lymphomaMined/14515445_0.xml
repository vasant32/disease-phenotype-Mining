<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> have been recently classified into two prognostically relevant subgroups differing in the gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The key genes suitable for routine diagnostics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> have not been yet identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to study changes and expression of several genes and proteins participating in the genesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed a group of 31 patients with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Basic clinical data including follow-up of the patients were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> were examined by a panel of immunohistochemical reactions with antibodies against CD20, CD79a, BCL-2, BCL-6, CD10, Ki-67 and TP53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FISH was used to detect a translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21) and/or a break in BCL6 region (3q27) suggestive of a translocation with a variable translocation partner t(3;?) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PCR was utilized to detect the translocation t(14;18) and a clonal rearrangement of heavy and/or kappa chain of the immunoglobin genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The expression of BCL-2 protein appeared to correlate with a higher mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The expression of other proteins examined in the study did not correspond significantly with the clinical development of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> as a component had significantly higher mortality rate than the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> developing de novo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, higher mortality was evident in cases with higher values of the International Prognostic Index (IPI) </plain></SENT>
