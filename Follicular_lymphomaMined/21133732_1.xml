<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the clinical outcome of FL has been distinguished by immune microenvironment-associated gene signatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our study, gene expression profiling (GEP) was performed in 31 non-selected patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), 12 of whom were in relapse and the remaining 19 newly diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A custom oligonucleotide microarray (Agilent 8 × 15K) was used which contained probes for about 3500 genes, including those that had been previously published as demonstrating significant prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An unsupervised approach was not able to recognize clinically different FLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As the previously published prognostically relevant gene signatures could not be properly verified, probably due to microarray platform differences, template matching was therefore used in order to define two gene sets with differential gene expression among our samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These gene sets shared an overrepresentation of genes with similar biological functions and were termed 'T-CELL' and 'PROLIFERATION' profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 'poor profile' was then defined by a high PROLIFERATION score (upper tertile) and/or low T-CELL score (lower tertile) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 'poor profile' cohort contained a significantly higher proportion of relapsed cases (p &lt; 0.05, Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a comparison of samples from initial diagnosis and from relapse showed significant differences mainly in the T-CELL profile (p = 0.036; χ(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This supports the hypothesis that the number of T-cells and their expression pattern play a major role in FL development </plain></SENT>
