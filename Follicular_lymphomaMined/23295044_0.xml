<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical impact of PET carried out at the end of the patient's course of treatment is undeniable and recommendations must be followed in the interpretation of these examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PET is highly recommended as part of the initial investigations of these diseases because it can be used as a reference for the interpretation at treatment completion and allows disease spread to be assessed with greater sensitivity and specificity than when computed tomography (CT) is used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It seems to be certain that PET is useful for interim examinations too, in terms of assessing prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>, although its impact in terms of early changes to treatment is still to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The criteria for interpreting the results of these early assessments are still evolving and the annual meetings in Menton, France, of groups of experts are leading towards a uniform interpretation method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, PET can be useful for confirming <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">local disease</z:e> staging, especially in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and for guiding biopsy in patients with low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that is suspicious for transformation into more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several studies are in agreement that PET is valuable for assessing prognosis at treatment completion in FL and mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but prospective studies are needed for this new indication to be validated </plain></SENT>
