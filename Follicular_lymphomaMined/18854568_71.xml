<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with CD20(+) stage III or IV follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, who achieved a complete response (CR)/unconfirmed CR (CRu) or partial response (PR) after first-line induction treatment, were randomly assigned to receive (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (rituximab 250 mg/m(2) on day -7 and day 0 followed on day 0 by (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan 14.8 MBq/kg; maximum of 1,184 MBq) or no further treatment (control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS), which was calculated from the time of random assignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 414 patients (consolidation, n = 208; control, n = 206) were enrolled at 77 centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan consolidation significantly prolonged median PFS (after a median observation time of 3.5 years) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (36.5 v 13.3 months in control arm; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.465; P &lt; .0001) and regardless of whether patients achieved PR (29.3 v 6.2 months in control arm; HR = 0.304; P &lt; .0001) or CR/CRu (53.9 v 29.5 months in control arm; HR = 0.613; P = .0154) after induction treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median PFS with consolidation was prolonged in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index risk subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan consolidation, 77% of patients in PR after induction converted to CR/CRu, resulting in a final CR rate of 87% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common toxicity with (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan was hematologic, and grade 3 or 4 infections occurred in 8% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Consolidation of first remission with (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan in advanced-stage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is highly effective with no unexpected toxicities, prolonging PFS by 2 years and resulting in high PR-to-CR conversion rates regardless of type of first-line induction treatment </plain></SENT>
