<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Investigators disagree on whether follicular large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FLCL) behaves like other follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, with no plateau in the survival curve, or as a more aggressive but potentially curable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reported in 1984 results for 62 FLCL patients treated at our institution; the current report updates those results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-two patients referred from 1973-1981, including fifteen (24%) patients with Ann Arbor stage I-II and forty-seven (76%) with stage III-IV FLCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients received radiation (XRT) alone, forty patients XRT and chemotherapy, and fifteen patients received chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median follow-up was 14.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median survival was 5.1 years, with 21% alive at 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The failure-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e>) at 10 years was 31% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis revealed that age, Ann Arbor stage, and the International Index correlated with survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Performance status, number of platelets, and LDH correlated with failure-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FLCL responds to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-based regimens similarly to diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with FLCL have the potential for prolonged failure-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Variables that predict the survival in aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> apply as well in this type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
