<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 21 FLs tested contained lymphokine-synthesizing cells in the interfollicular and follicular areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Enumeration of lymphokine synthesizing cells indicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> IL-2 production among lymph nodes tested; 2 of the 21 had much higher densities of IL-2-producing cells (855 and 570/cm2) than did the remaining 19 (mean, 92 +/- 15/cm2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IFN-gamma-producing cells displayed no such variation (mean, 77 +/- 8 IFN-gamma-producing cells/cm2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean IL-2/IFN-gamma-producing cell ratio was 2.69 +/- 0.84, indicating preferential induction of IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The detailed distribution of lymphokine-producing cells showed that IL-2 and IFN-gamma-producing cells were located mainly in the follicular areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean follicular/interfollicular ratio was 1.82 +/- 0.16 for IL-2 and 1.92 +/- 0.19 for IFN-gamma-producing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results show that T-cell activation, defined by lymphokine production, occurs in FL lymph nodes in direct contact with malignant B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, lymphokine production may play an important role in the control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e>, which is the result of interaction between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and host-derived immune reaction </plain></SENT>
