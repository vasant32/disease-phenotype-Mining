<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors examined the number and distribution of cells reacting with monoclonal antibodies to T-cell subsets in frozen tissue sections of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (30 follicular and 17 diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In five diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (two lymphocytic, three small cleaved cell) the neoplastic B-lymphocytes reacted with the monoclonal antibody anti-T1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other cases, the monoclonal antibodies to T-cell subsets reacted only with small lymphocytes concentrated between the follicles of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and distributed randomly in diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of T cells and the T4+/T8+ ratio in follicular small cleaved and mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was similar, although not identical, to that seen in hyperplastic lymphoid follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fewer T cells and a decrease in the T4+/T8+ ratio were seen in follicular large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number and distribution of T cells in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is consistent with the hypothesis that there is a functional interaction between neoplastic B cells and benign T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were found in which the neoplastic B cells reacted with anti-T3, anti-T4, or anti-T8 </plain></SENT>
