<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The drugs bendamustine and fludarabine have cytotoxic activity as monotherapy in indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and show synergism in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we combined both drugs in a multicenter clinical phase I/II trial to evaluate their toxicity and efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bendamustine was given at 30 or 40 mg/m2/d (dose levels 1 and 2), fludarabine at 30 mg/m2/d, each drug on days 1 to 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six cycles were to be given every 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 29 patients with relapsed or refractory indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During phase I, 9 patients were treated at dose level 1 and 7 patients at dose level 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients were added to the study during phase II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 11 patients mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 2 patients lymphoplasmocytic and 2 patients nodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median age was 62 years (range 39-74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were in stages III or IV of their disease and had received prior chemotherapy with or without additional radio- or immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The dose limiting toxicity was hematotoxicity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases and occurred in 3 of 7 evaluable patients at dose level I and in 3 of 7 patients at dose level 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient at dose level 2 died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The study was continued at dose level 1 (phase II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Analysis of 19 evaluable patients treated at dose level 1 reveiled hematotoxicity CTC grade III in 47% and grade IV in 26% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> occurred in 4 patients (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>On an intent-to-treat basis, 45% or 32% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients at dose level 1 reached CR or PR, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Nine of 9 patients with mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> responded to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 77% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Eight of 15 responders relapsed after a median follow-up time of 14 months (range 2-43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The major complication of fludarabine in combination with bendamustine is hematotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Dose level 1 with 30 mg/m2/d of both drugs on days 1 to 3 was defined as the recommended dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Despite unfavorable prognostic features (histologic subtype, stage of disease, pretreatment) response rates were good with this regimen </plain></SENT>
