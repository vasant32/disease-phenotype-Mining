<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We have observed that molecular response, as defined by a PCR-negative status during the first year of therapy, along with beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M), was the most important variable associated with failure-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e>) in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein, we present an update of the previously published MDACC series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 116 patients (male:female ratio 64:52; median age: 52 years) with indolent FL and BCL-2 rearrangement (at MBR or mcr breakpoints) assessable in peripheral blood (pb) by PCR prior to treatment, and with two or more PCR determinations during the first year, were selected for the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 116 patients, 4 who presented with progression and 1 who died of unrelated causes during the first year were excluded from the landmark analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred patients (86%) achieved clinical CR and 80 (69%) achieved a negative PCR status within first year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> was 6.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> was 73% and 28% for molecular responders and nonresponders, respectively (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In spite of this strikingly higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> favoring molecular responders, no clearcut plateau was evident in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molecular response assessed in pb (P = 0.001) and serum beta 2M (P &lt; 0.001) were the most important factors to predict <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> in the multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the subset of patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> beta 2M and molecular CR, there was a trend for a plateau in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant difference between the groups has been observed so far in terms of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Molecular response assessed in pb using a PCR technique is, along with beta 2M, the most important factor to predict <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> in FL </plain></SENT>
