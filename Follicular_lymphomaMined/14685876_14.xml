<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred sixty-one consecutive cases of ocular adnexal lymphoproliferative lesions were subdivided into reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> (RLH), atypical <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> (ALH) and OAL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latter were sub-typed according to the new WHO <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lesions were investigated applying standard immunohistochemical methods with antibodies specific for pRB, p53, p16, p21, BCL-6 and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> oncogene-1-protein (MUM1, also known as IRF4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main endpoints included the development of a local recurrence, of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association of prognostic variables with endpoints was assessed by multiple logistic and Cox regression models, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ocular adnexal lymphoproliferative lesions were categorised as OAL ( n=230; 88%), RLH ( n=29; 11%), and ALH ( n=2; 1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The major <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes included 136 extranodal marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (EMZL), 31 diffuse large cell B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 27 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 9 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo>, 9 lymphoplasmocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytomas</z:e> and 8 mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up time was 44.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most OAL patients had Stage IE disease and were treated with radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven (25%) Stage IE patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> relapses: these were significantly associated with an increased BCL6 blast percentage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two (42%) Stage IE patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e>: they had "non-EMZL" with large growth fractions and increased blast percentages for BCL6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven (25%) OAL patients died because of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was significantly associated on multivariable analysis with advanced clinical stage, an age &gt;60 years and large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour growth</z:e> fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Subtyping of OAL according to the new WHO <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Classification, the stage of disease and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell growth fraction aided the prediction of (1) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> relapse, (2) the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> and (3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in OAL </plain></SENT>
