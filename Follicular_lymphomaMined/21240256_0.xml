<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is one of the most common forms of the low-grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in adults, with a characteristic translocation, t(14;18)(q32;q21) that deregulates the expression of the BCL2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical course of FL patients is variable, whereby a subset of patients survive for long periods even without relapses, whereas the majority have frequent relapses with shorter survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed a series of 186 FLs, studying the correlation between clinical outcome and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell expression of a set of immunohistochemical markers, using an automated procedure for tissue microarrays to reduce the subjectivity of scoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results identified several markers associated with differences in overall survival (OS) in univariate analyses, such as Cyclin E, Mdm2, CD10, p21, IgD, Bcl-xL, CD30, and E2F6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases with a higher level of expression of Cyclin E, Mdm2, p21, IgD, Bcl-xL, CD30, and E2F6 were associated with a significantly shorter OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, strong CD10 expression was linked to a significantly better outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A Cox model was then constructed, integrating the Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) score and a restricted selection of three immunohistochemical markers: Cyclin E, Mdm2, and CD10 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A potentially useful finding is that the integrated FLIPI plus immunohistochemical model can be used to identify a subset of 26 patients (almost 20% of the total series), with a survival probability of 100% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This not only confirms that a group of FL cases may have a very good clinical course, but also indicates that this group can be identified using this integrated clinical and immunohistochemical approach </plain></SENT>
