<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although this form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> often pursues an indolent course, in some cases it may behave in a more aggressive manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical and histological parameters have been shown to correlate with an adverse prognosis but a number of cytogenetic abnormalities may also be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although, the t(14;18) in itself does not affect outcome in cases of FL, secondary abnormalities that occur in a complex polyploid karyotype may identify cases with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is unusual to find both t(14;18) and C-MYC translocation in the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>; those cases in which it has been described include examples of high-grade B-cell NHL (either de novo or transformed FL) or B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this report, three cases of FL are described in which both t(14;18) and a C-MYC translocation were identified at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also summarize four further cases from the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is a small series but one which raises the possibility that the presence of a C-MYC translocations at presentation may identify a particularly aggressive subtype of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to investigate the true incidence of this aberration, the impact on C-MYC regulation, clinical course and response to treatment </plain></SENT>
