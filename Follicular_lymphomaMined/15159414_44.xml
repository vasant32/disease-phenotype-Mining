<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Promising new therapeutic options for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) include fludarabine plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> (FM) and the mouse/human anti-CD20 antibody, rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a randomized comparative trial of FM with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHOP) front-line chemotherapy with and without sequential rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> previously untreated CD20(+) FL patients presenting in 15 Italian cooperative institutions from October 1999 were randomly allocated to FM or CHOP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following clinical or molecular restaging, patients in complete remission (CR) with bcl-2/IgH negativity (CR(-)) received no further treatment; those in CR with bcl-2/IgH positivity (CR(+)) received rituximab, as did those in partial remission (PR) with bcl-2/IgH negativity (PR(-)) or positivity (PR(+)); nonresponders (NR subgroup) were off study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After chemotherapy, the FM arm achieved higher rates of CR (68% [49 of 72 patients] v 42% [29 of 68 patients]; P =.003) and CR(-) (39% [28 of 72 patients] v 13 of 68 patients [19%]; P =.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rituximab elicited CR(-) in 55 of 95 treated patients (58%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The final CR(-) rate was higher in the FM arm (71% [51 of 72 patients] v 51% [35 of 68 patients]; P =.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, with a median follow-up of 19 months (range, 9 to 37 months), no statistically significant difference was found among the various study arms in terms of both progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results indicate that FM is superior to CHOP for front-line treatment of FL and that rituximab is an effective sequential treatment option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, they also confirm that this superiority is unlikely to translate into either better PFS or OS </plain></SENT>
