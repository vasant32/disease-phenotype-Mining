<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: ADCC was performed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> release assays in vitro, using peripheral blood mononuclear cells, IL-2-activated or expanded NK cells, neutrophils or macrophages as effector cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines and freshly isolated leukemic samples were used as targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NK cells, but PMN or macrophages mediated rituximab dependent cellular cytotoxicity against two B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Purified NK cells (95% CD56+/CD16+) reached 70% lysis at the highest E:T ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> freshly isolated B <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases, including 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, 1 B-prolymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, 1 mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 2 marginal zone lymhomas and 2 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were poorly lysed by ADCC in the same conditions and regardless of CD20 expression levels, reaching a mean of 4% and 27% maximal lysis with PBMC or purified NK cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, short term IL-2 cultured PBMC, containing 10 % activated NK cells, as well as long-term expanded NK cells, containing 80-95% activated NK cells, became strong ADCC effector cells with rituximab and lysed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> leukemic samples to a mean of 57% and 67% at the highest E:T ratio, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Primary leukemic cells are more resistant than cell lines to rituximab- and NK cell-mediated ADCC but short-term exposure to IL-2 or long-term expansion of NK cells in vitro may provide effective tools to improve the therapeutic activity of rituximab </plain></SENT>
