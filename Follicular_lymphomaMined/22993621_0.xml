<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several studies have highlighted the importance of the microenvironment in the behaviour of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted an immunohistochemical analysis to assess the role of different cell subpopulations, i.e. CD8, CD68 and forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3)-positive regulatory T cells (Treg cells) in 84 lymph nodes of 58 patients with FL (58 at diagnosis, 26 at relapse) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the overall effect of Tregs is considered to depend on their number in relation to CD8(+) effector T cells, we determined the corresponding ratio for each patient and correlated the results with clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The interfollicular CD8/FOXP3(+) cell ratio was significantly higher in patients with histological grade 3 tumours (2.04 vs. 1.63) and with a high risk FLIPI index (2.99 vs. 1.53) compared to those with grade 1-2 tumours or a low-intermediate FLIPI index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained for the follicular CD8(+)/FOXP3(+) cell ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The interfollicular CD8/FOXP3 ratio was found to have prognostic value [a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 82 vs. 59% for a ratio of Â±1.68] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, an interfollicular FOXP3(+) cell number of more than 86 cells/mm(2) was correlated with a more favourable outcome (p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When patients at diagnosis and relapse were compared, a significant difference (p=0.05) in the localization (interfollicular vs. intrafollicular) of FOXP3(+) cells was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CD8/FOXP3 ratio in the interfollicular areas was significantly different (1.66 at diagnosis vs. 2.2 at relapse, p=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of a small number of FOXP3(+) cells with a high CD8/FOXP3 ratio is probably the indicator of an active immune response during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> development, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells acting as targets or bystanders </plain></SENT>
