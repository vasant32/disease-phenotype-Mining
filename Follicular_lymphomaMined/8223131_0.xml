<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>1984 to June 1986, trying to find out the characteristic features of histo- and immuno-pathology of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in China and relationship with HTLV-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fresh specimens were collected from 209 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients who were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> newly diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 25 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (12%), and the other 184 cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (88%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These 184 cases were classified according to the Working Formulation proposed by the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute of USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was found that low grade group was 5.4% and intermediate and high grade were 48.9% and 38.0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was 4.3% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of small lymphocytic type was 2.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen cases (7.6%) were pleomorphic type mimicking adult T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> reported by Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunotyping was carried out in 162 cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with T-cell markers were 33.9%, B-cell markers 62.4%, and non-T, non-B markers 3.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequency of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases varied from area to area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Suzhou was 45.8%, Nanjing 57.9%, Qingdao 44.4% and shenyang 11.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the group studied there were only 3 cases showed HTLV-1 positive in serum with pleomorphic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and T-cell markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that composition of histopathologic types of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in China is different from that in western countries, and the incidence of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is high in certain areas of the lower reaches of the Yangzi River.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
