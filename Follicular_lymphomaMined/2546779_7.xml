<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy (H) and light (L) chain gene rearrangements of the high incidence SJL <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (reticulum cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>, RCS) have been analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both primary and transplanted RCS show rearrangements of H and kappa L chains, demonstrating that these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> are of B cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These data are consistent with previous results indicating that these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> are a mouse model for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A long-term transplanted line and the in vitro line derived from it, cRCS-X, have a single rearranged JH-C gamma 2a fragment and one rearranged C alpha gene fragment which does not hybridize with a probe for the JH gene segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cell lines also have two rearranged J kappa-C kappa fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Primary tumors</z:e> and early passages are more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> with respect to Ig gene rearrangements, possibly because more than one B cell clone is present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although no synthesis of IgG2a, or of any Ig, could be detected by the in vitro cRCS-X cells, these cells contain abundant poly(A)+ <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> that hybridize with gamma 2a and kappa probes as well as lesser amounts of alpha and epsilon <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of these H chain <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> hybridized with probes for the JH gene segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The epsilon and alpha <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> are the same size as transcripts of germ-line CH genes which have been identified in other systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the gamma 2a <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> are smaller than previously described germ-line C gamma 2a <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and appear to be transcribed from aberrantly rearranged JH-C gamma 2a genes </plain></SENT>
