<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation has been proposed as a cardinal feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumourigenesis</z:e>, although the precise mechanism, frequency, relevance, and extent of NF-kappaB activation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> remain to be fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, expression profiling and tissue microarray studies of 209 and 323 non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHLs) respectively, including the most frequent sub-types of NHL, were employed to generate a hypothesis concerning the most common NF-kappaB targets in NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These analyses showed that NF-kappaB activation is a common phenomenon in NHL, resulting in the expression of distinct sets of NF-kappaB target genes, depending on the cell context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BCL2 and BIRC5/Survivin were identified as key NF-kappaB targets and their expression distinguished small and aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in the vast majority of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the expression of these markers was mutually exclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A set of genes was identified whose expression correlates either with BIRC5/Survivin or with BCL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BIRC5/Survivin expression, in contrast to BCL2, was associated with a signature of cell proliferation (overexpression of cell cycle control, DNA repair, and polymerase genes), which may contribute to the aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> expressed highly elevated levels of BCL2 protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, higher than that observed in reactive mantle zone cells or even in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, where BCL2 expression is deregulated through the t(14;18) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In parallel with this observation, BIRC5/Survivin expression was higher in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> than in non-tumoural germinal centre cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies confirmed that NF-kappaB activation contributes to the expression of both markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In cell lines representing aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, NF-kappaB inhibition resulted in a decrease in BIRC5/Survivin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (CLL)-derived lymphocytes, NF-kappaB inhibition resulted in a marked decrease in BCL2 expression </plain></SENT>
