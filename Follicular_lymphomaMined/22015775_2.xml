<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We combined denileukin diftitox with rituximab in previously untreated, advanced-stage follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients anticipating that denileukin diftitox would deplete CD25+ T(reg) cells while rituximab would deplete malignant B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received rituximab 375 mg/m(2) weekly for 4 weeks and denileukin diftitox 18 mcg/kg/day for 5 days every 3 weeks for 4 cycles; neither agent was given as maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between August 2008 and March 2010, 24 patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient died before treatment was given and was not included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 23 patients (48%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 27-69%) responded; 2 (9%) had complete responses and 9 (39%) had partial responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The progression-free rate at 2 years was 55% (95%CI: 37-82%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (57%) experienced grade ≥3 adverse events and one patient (4%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In correlative studies, soluble CD25 and the number of CD25+ T cells decreased after treatment; however, there was a compensatory increase in IL-15 and IP-10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that although the addition of denileukin diftitox to rituximab decreased the number of CD25+ T cells, denileukin diftitox contributed to the toxicity of the combination without an improvement in response rate or time to progression </plain></SENT>
