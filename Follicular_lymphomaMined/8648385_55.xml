<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate retrospectively the results of radiotherapy for 177 patients with stage I (n = 73 [41%]) and II (n = 104 [59%]) follicular small cleaved-cell and follicular mixed small cleaved-cell and large-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) treated in the Department of Radiation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo>, Stanford University between 1961 and 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Histology was follicular small cleaved-cell in 101 (57%) cases and follicular mixed small cleaved-cell and large-cell in 76 (43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-five patients (25%) had staging laparotomy; 34 (19%) had extranodal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had received radiotherapy, either to one side of the diaphragm (involved or extended field) or to both sides (total lymphoid irradiation [TLI] or subtotal lymphoid irradiation [STLI] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Radiotherapy doses ranged from 35 to 50 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median follow-up duration was 7.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The longest follow-up duration was 31 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival rates at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years were 82%, 64%, 44%, and 35%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median survival time was 13.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 5, 10, 15, and 20 years, 55%, 44%, 40%, and 37% of patients, respectively, were relapse-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only five of 47 patients who reached 10 years without relapse subsequently developed recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Survival and freedom from relapse (FFR) were significantly worse for older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Relapse rates were lower following treatment on both sides of the diaphragm or staging laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed that youth and staging laparotomy were associated with significantly better survival and that FFR was better following treatment on both sides of the diaphragm or laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy remains the treatment of choice for early-stage low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients who have remained free of disease for 10 years are unlikely to relapse </plain></SENT>
