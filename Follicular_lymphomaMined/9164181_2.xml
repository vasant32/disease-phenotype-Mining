<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between April 1981 and June 1986, 127 patients with de novo advanced-stage diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were treated with a 12-week chemotherapy program (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> [MACOP-B]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall survival rate at 10 years is 52% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred six patients (83%) entered a complete remission (CR) and 43 of them relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up duration of 146 months, 26 patients relapsed early and 17 relapsed late, ie, after a continuous CR (cCR) of greater than 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> late relapses occurred in patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 24 months from diagnosis, the rate of late relapse averaged 2.2% per year and reached a projected 22% actuarial risk of late relapse after 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median time to late relapse was 69 months (range, 38 to 141) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten patients relapsed with aggressive histologic subtypes and were treated with curative intent using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four remain in second CR, one is alive with disease, and five died of disease or while on treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 6-year overall survival rate from the time of relapse (SFR) for these 10 patients is 42% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six patients relapsed with low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These patients received various treatments intended to control, but not necessarily cure disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One is in second CR, one is alive with disease, and four died of disease or while on treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The 6-year overall SFR rate for these six patients is 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>bcl-2 translocation and Bcl-2 protein expression at diagnosis did not predict for the type of late relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>One patient did not undergo repeat biopsy at relapse and died 9 months later despite aggressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Curative therapy should be attempted in patients who relapse late with aggressive-histology <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and those who relapse with follicular histology may benefit from palliative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The behavior of late-relapse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is similar to de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, with outcome dictated by the histologic subtype at relapse </plain></SENT>
