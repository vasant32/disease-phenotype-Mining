<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In our recent study, we determined the cut-off value of CD20 expression at the level of 25, 000 molecules of equivalent soluble <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51217">fluorochrome</z:chebi> (MESF) to be the predictor of response to rituximab containing treatment in patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 17.5% of patients, who had the level of CD20 expression below the cut-off value, the response to rituximab containing treatment was significantly worse than in the rest of the patients with the level of CD20 expression above the cut-off value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients with low CD20 expression who might not benefit from rituximab containing treatment was not necessarily representative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore the aim of this study was to quantify the CD20 expression in a larger series of patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> which might allow us to determine more reliably the proportion of patients with the CD20 expression below the cut-off </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cytological samples of 64 diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), 56 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL), 31 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo> (CLL), 34 mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>), 18 marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>) and 15 B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> unclassified were analyzed for CD20 expression by quantitative four-color flow cytometric measurements using FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The range of CD20 expression in different B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was very broad, varying from 2 737 to 115 623 MESF in CLL and 3 549 to 679 577 MESF in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, when we compared the CD20 expression in the groups of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, FL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>, CLL and B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> unclassified, it was found to be significantly lower (p = 0.002) only in CLL but did not significantly differ in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> types (p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three out of 218 (24.3%) patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had the CD20 expression below the cut-off value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The CD20 expression in CLL is significantly lower than in most histological types of mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in which it appears to be comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Approximately 25% of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients have the CD20 expression below the cut-off value showing that the low CD20 expression might be more common than presumed from our previous study </plain></SENT>
