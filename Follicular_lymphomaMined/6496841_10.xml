<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histologically, on a background of reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo>, the nodes contained one or more germinal centers showing progressive transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These were three to four times the diameter of the other germinal centers and composed predominantly of small, round lymphocytes admixed with scattered immunoblasts and occasional benign histiocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinically, the majority of these patients were young males presenting with an asymptomatic solitary enlarged lymph node. fifteen had prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five had concurrent progressive transformation of germinal centers and lymphocytic predominance <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (two of these also had a subsequent biopsy showing only progressive transformation of germinal centers) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The largest group of 31 patients had no prior or subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of the 50 developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recognition of this phenomenon is important so that it will not be misconstrued as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0746341" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, as de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, or as follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which occurred in 12 (24%) of the cases </plain></SENT>
