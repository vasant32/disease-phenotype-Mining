<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Six cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> contained an abundant plasma cell component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With immunoperoxidase techniques, this was found to demonstrate monotypic cytoplasmic marking for either K or L Ig light chain in five cases, and for IgA heavy chain only in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A histogenetic relationship between follicular center cells and plasma cells was suggested by cell forms morphologically intermediate between these two types and by monotypic plasma cells in the neoplastic follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The progressive differentiation of follicular center cells into Ig-secreting cells in these cases is likely to be the result of an alteration of the immunoregulatory mechanisms that usually block the differentiation of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four of our patients presented with disseminated disease, three had extranodal presentation and four manifested serum paraproteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their median survival was 40 months; two of them died of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The published data and our own suggest that follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with plasmacytic differentiation is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> of intermediate grade, with survival and clinical features closer to lymphoplasmacytic/lymphoplasmacytoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (LP <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytoma</z:e>) than to follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
