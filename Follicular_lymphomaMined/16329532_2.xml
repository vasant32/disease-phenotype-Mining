<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> is a relatively common group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> diagnosed in hospital practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to elucidate the pattern of this disease encountered in a public service hospital of the Ministry of Health, Malaysia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 98 biopsies from 92 patients were retrieved from the archives of Klang General Hospital, from January 1993 to June 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The histopathology of these biopsies were reviewed by two pathologists, and confirmed cases were sub-classified according to the WHO proposed scheme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining with a panel of lymphoid antibodies was performed in aid of sub-typing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were screened for Epstein-Barr virus association by in-situ hybridisation technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 15 biopsies were excluded from further analysis due to inadequate material for further study or diagnosed as non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining 83 biopsies were from 80 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>52 were males and 28 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The male: female ratio was 1.9:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were 64 Malays, 4 Chinese and 12 Indians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ages of patients ranged from 3 to 86 years with a mean age of 50.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>73.8% of the diagnostic materials were nodal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>), 6 being mixed-cellularity, 4 nodular-<z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, 1 lymphocyte-rich, 2 lymphocyte-depleted, 1 lymphocyte-predominant, and 66 had non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>: NHL ratio was 1:4.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Of the 66 cases of NHL, 9 (13.6%) were T- and 57 (86.4%) B-cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The most common NHL encountered was diffuse large B-cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Follicular-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> constituted 16.7% of these NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>77.8% of T-NHL and 10.5% of B-NHL was EBV associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Double staining of EBER with CD20 and EBER with CD3 in the T-NHL cases showed that in a majority of the cases, EBER-positive large cells did not express the T- or B- cell antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a relatively small proportion of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in this series of Asian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The reason is thought to be the lower utilisation rate of this hospital service by ethnic Chinese, as reflected by the hospital admission data </plain></SENT>
