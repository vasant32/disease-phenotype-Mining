<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We conducted a population-based, case-control study to test the hypothesis that consumption of meat and meat-related <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagens</z:chebi> increases the risk of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), and whether the associations are modified by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants (336 cases and 460 controls) completed a 117-item food frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The risk of NHL was associated with a higher intake of red meat (OR = 1.5; CI, 1.1-2.2), total fat (OR = 1.4; CI, 1.0-2.1), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> (OR = 1.5; CI, 1.0-2.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NHL risk was also associated with a higher intake of very well-done pork (OR = 2.5; 95 % CI, 1.4-4.3) and the meat-related <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagen</z:chebi> MeIQx (OR = 1.6; 95 % CI, 1.1-2.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses of the major NHL histologic subtypes showed a positive association between diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and higher intake of red meat (OR = 2.1; 95 % CI, 1.1-3.9) and the association was largely due to meat-related <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagens</z:chebi> as a positive association was observed for higher intakes of both MeIQx (OR = 2.4; 95 % CI, 1.2-4.6) and DiMeIQx (OR = 1.9; 95 % CI, 1.0-3.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the OR for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) was also increased with a higher red meat intake (OR = 1.9; 95 % CI, 1.1-3.3), the association appeared to be due to increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16196">oleic acid</z:chebi> (OR = 1.7; 95 % CI: 0.9-3.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found no evidence that polymorphisms in NAT1 or NAT2 modify the association between NHL and meat-related <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results provide further evidence that red meat consumption is associated with an increase in NHL risk, and new evidence that the specific components of meat, namely fat and meat-related <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagens</z:chebi>, may be impacting NHL subtype risk differently </plain></SENT>
