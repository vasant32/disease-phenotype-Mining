<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 8 males and 6 females who had large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 11), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, predominantly large cell (n = 1), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 1) and peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven patients were over 60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PNHL stage IV, III and II was diagnosed in 7, 5 and 2 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Daunoxome dose was 80 mg/m2 with an increase up to 100 mg/m2 in case of slow response and good tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other drugs were used in standard doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 6 patients achieved complete remission (43%) and 5 patients--partial response (36%), the overall response was 79% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients did not respond to therapy and died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients are still in complete and two in partial remission, median follow-up being 22 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rest 3 patients were treated with other modalities, one of them died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As to complications that might be related to daunoxome, there was myelodepression (6% of profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> &lt; 1000 microl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patients had deterioration of the left ventricular ejection fraction (ultrasound measurements) or clinical signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (median follow-up for 10 patients was 22 months) including those in whom high cumulative doses were used (640-840 mg/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient with compromised heart function had frequent ventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>extrasystole</z:mp> immediately after daunoxome infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Tolerance of CDxOP is acceptable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The results of the treatment are comparable with those of standard chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further comparative studies are needed for determination of efficacy and maximal tolerated dose of daunoxome in combination with other drugs and irradiation, of long-term side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This drug may be beneficial for elderly patients </plain></SENT>
