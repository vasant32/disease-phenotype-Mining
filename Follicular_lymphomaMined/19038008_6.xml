<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that recognizes the CD20 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been used to treat B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B-NHL), but recently rituximab resistance has been a cause for concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined histological and immunohistochemical changes in 59 patients with B-NHL after rituximab therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients comprised 32 men and 27 women with a median age of 59 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre-rituximab specimens comprised 34 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL), 11 diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), 10 mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, two marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZBCL</z:e>), and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo> (CLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD20 expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells was evaluated by immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Post-rituximab materials were taken a median of 6 months (4 days to 59 months) after rituximab therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixteen cases (27%) showed loss of CD20 expression with four histological patterns: pattern 1, no remarkable histological change (FL, 5; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, 3; and CLL, 2); pattern 2, proliferation of plasmacytoid cells (FL, 2; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, 1; and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZBCL</z:e>, 1); pattern 3, transformation to classical Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL, 1); and pattern 4, transformation to anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-like undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL, 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Loss of CD20 was unrelated to the interval of biopsies, treatment regimen, clinical response, and frequency of rituximab administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Loss of CD20 within 1 month of rituximab therapy (3/14, 21%) and regain of CD20 (2/7, 29%) were not frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CD20-positive relapse with transformation occurred most frequently in cases of early relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, B-NHL showed various histological and immunophenotypic changes after rituximab therapy, including not only CD20 loss but also proliferation of plasmacytoid cells or transformation to special subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
