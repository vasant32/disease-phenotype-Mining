<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The utility of this exonuclease-based PCR assay as a rapid alternative to conventional PCR for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-associated t(14;18)(q32;q21) was evaluated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The specificity of the assay for t(14;18) involving bcl-2 and immunoglobulin heavy-chain joining region (JH) genes was assessed by analyzing DNA from 53 patients (38 B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 15 nonneoplastic proliferations) and correlating the exonuclease PCR data with conventional PCR results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>bcl-2/JH fusion sequences were detected by exonuclease-based PCR in 24 of 25 cases shown to be bcl-2 rearranged by conventional PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fusion sequences were not detected in patients who were negative by conventional PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall concordance between the two assays was 98% (52 of 53 cases concordant positive or negative) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a serial dilution study using t(14;18)-positive cell line DNA, exonuclease-based PCR detected fusion sequences at DNA concentrations of 5 pg, equivalent to 0.6 to 0.8 genomes per reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, this study demonstrated that exonuclease-based PCR for t(14;18) is both specific and highly sensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The elimination of the post-PCR amplicon detection steps and the ability to quantitate the input target DNA sequences make this assay ideal for routine diagnostics and monitoring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
