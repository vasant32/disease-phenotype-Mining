<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> may also present in the thyroid gland, but its clinicopathologic features at this site are not well characterized, leading to difficulties in diagnosis and clinical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have addressed this problem by studying the clinical, morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic features of 22 such cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases showed <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> characteristic of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, however, in many the interfollicular neoplastic infiltrate was particularly prominent and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> contained readily identifiable and often striking lymphoepithelial lesions, features heretofore considered indicative of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at this site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 13 of 18 cases for which sufficient evidence was available had clinical and/or histologic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100646'>thyroiditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of genetic and immunohistochemical features identified 2 distinct groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 1 group, similar to typical adult follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, cases carried a t(14;18)/IGH-BCL2 and/or expressed Bcl-2, and were mostly CD10-positive and of World Health Organization (WHO) grade 1 to 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in the other group lacked IGH-BCL2 and Bcl-2 expression, were often of WHO grade 3 and were often CD10-negative, similar to the minority of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> previously described that are Bcl-2-negative and are often encountered at other extranodal sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 2 groups differed in clinical stage at presentation, 11 patients in the former group but none in the latter group having disease beyond the thyroid gland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Appreciation of the spectrum of morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic characteristics of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> presenting in the thyroid gland should aid both diagnosis and clinical management </plain></SENT>
