<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Folicullar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) is one of the most common types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (25-40%), characterized by a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> enlargement of lymph nodes, impairment of hematopoiesis, increased risk to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, a relatively good prognosis, but usually incurable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histopathologically, FL has been graded according to the proportion of centroblasts and stratified into grades 1-3: FL grade 1-2 (low-grade), which include cases with few centroblasts, and FL grade 3, divided into grades 3a and 3b, based on the absence of centrocytes in the latter category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several studies have identified some differences between grade 3a and grade 3b of FL, with most cases of FL grade 3b being more closely related to diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) at molecular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several multicenter prospective randomized trials demonstrated an improved outcome when Rituximab (R) was added to chemotherapy for the treatment of follicular non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and a beneficial effect in the quality of life after Rituximab maintenance therapy at these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIM OF STUDY: To establish some correlation between histology, prognostic factors, treatment and evaluate whether maintenance therapy with anti-CD20+ monoclonal antibodies prolonged progression free survival compared to observation only at the patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> treated with R-chemotherapy regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied nineteen patients with follicular non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (grades 1-3) treated with R-CHOP/R-miniCHOP regimens hospitalized in the Clinic of Hematology from Craiova (Romania), between 2008-2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After these treatments, nine patients with stage III/IV follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were treated with Rituximab maintenance therapy (eight cycles Rituximab 375 mg/m(2), i.v., once every three months for two years) vs. observation only at 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our study, low-grade FL was correlated with a good prognosis at patients with FLIPI score 0-2; the statistical analysis revealed that the progression free survival (PFS) was prolonged at the patients with stage III/IV follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> who received Rituximab maintenance therapy compared to the ones with observation only with 1.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low-grade (1-2) FL was correlated with a good prognosis in patients with FLIPI score 0-2; Rituximab maintenance therapy compared with observation only is safe and prolonged progression free survival at patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> treated with R-chemotherapy as first line therapy </plain></SENT>
