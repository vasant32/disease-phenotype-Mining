<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A Phase II study of previously untreated patients with malignant low grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> given a combination of unlabeled tositumomab and tositumomab labeled with <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-131 has recently been completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The responses of these patients have been characterized, and for some of them <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> dosimetry during therapy has been estimated not only by pretherapy tracer conjugate views but also by a hybrid method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Available patients were studied if they had had a pelvic or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">abdominal tumor</z:e> evaluation by single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) and achieved a partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> outlined on the <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-131 conjugate-view images was called a composite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its volume estimate came from multiple, not necessarily contiguous, regions of interest (ROI) on the pretherapy computed tomography (CT) scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Its radiation dose was estimated from the weeklong series of pretherapy images and standard Medical Internal Radiation Dose methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography ROI were also grouped into smaller, contiguous volumes that defined individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their radiation doses were estimated by the hybrid method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This method employed the activity measured for each individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> by a single intratherapy SPECT scan, as well as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>'s volume, to individually normalize the composite time-activity curve as appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The individual normalization factors then converted the composite radiation dose to radiation doses for individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume was calculated for both composite and individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> at 12 weeks posttherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For 14 composite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in 10 patients, the median pretherapy volume was 170 cm(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Application of a sigmoidal curve function to the plot of volume reduction versus radiation absorbed dose resulted in degeneration of the curve into a straight line with a negative slope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical significance in the relationship (P = 0.73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>For 43 individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, the median pretherapy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume was 26 cm(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The plot of volume reduction versus dose was fairly well fit by a sigmoidal curve, and the relationship approached statistical significance (P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The representation assigned 56% of the shrinkage to the effects of unlabeled tositumomab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>For the subset of individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with a pretherapy volume less than 10 cm(3) from 6 patients (n = 15), the relationship was significant (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The sigmoidal representation assigned only 12% of the shrinkage to unlabeled tositumomab, as contrasted with 72% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with pretherapy volume greater than 10 cm(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For patients who attained a partial response, analysis of individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> by a hybrid dosimetric method led to a dependence between volume reduction at 12 weeks and radiation dose that tended to be significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The same was not true with dosimetry of composite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> based on pretherapy conjugate views alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>It appeared that volume reductions from both unlabeled antibody and radiation dose were important in tositumomab therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, with unlabeled antibody relatively more important for larger <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
