<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 22 diagnosed cases, based on conventional <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> examination and immunohistochemistry, to detect the Bcl-2 gene rearrangement by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lymph node tissues by the standard <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27338">xylene</z:chebi> treatment and proteinase K digestion method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rearrangement of the major breakpoint region was evident in 8 of the 22 cases (36%), determined by visualization of a discrete band hybridized with a chemiluminescence-labeled specific probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the number of cases is small, we believe it denotes a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> detection rate for PCR analysis, using DNA isolated from fixed tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the exception of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) analyzed included diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and mantle zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No Bcl-2 gene rearrangement was detected in any of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No evidence of Bcl-2 minor cluster sequence gene rearrangement was detected in any of the 38 NHL cases analyzed </plain></SENT>
