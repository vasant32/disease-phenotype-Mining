<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, the majority of responses to single-agent rituximab are incomplete, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> will experience disease progression at some point following rituximab therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rituximab has multiple mechanisms of inducing in vivo cytotoxicity, including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, direct apoptotic signaling, and possible vaccinal effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cellular microenvironment within follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has a profound impact on which mechanism is dominant, and confers resistance in many situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated and host-associated factors also contribute to rituximab resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There are multiple potential approaches to overcoming rituximab resistance, including rational biologic combination immunotherapy, engineered antibodies, and radioimmunoconjugates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Improved ability to overcome resistance will require further elucidation of critical signaling pathways involved in rituximab induced cytotoxicity and a comprehensive understanding of interactions between its multiple mechanisms of action </plain></SENT>
