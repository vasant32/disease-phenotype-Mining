<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using an ultrasensitive assay involving the PCR, we have examined the frequency of a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-associated translocation in peripheral blood from 132 individuals, most of whom were healthy blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This translocation occurs between the bcl-2 proto-oncogene and the JH gene region and prolongs the life of lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At a level of sensitivity of 1 translocation-bearing cell per 5 x 10(6) cells, almost one-half of healthy human adults had this translocation in the mononuclear fraction of peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the range of frequency of these translocations spanned almost three orders of magnitude among translocation-positive individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was a statistically significant increase with age in the percentage of individuals who were translocation positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such an age correlation was also seen for the percentage of blood donors with rather high translocation frequencies (&gt; or = 20 per 5 x 10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the blood donor who had by far the highest concentration of this translocation was a healthy 35-year-old male containing approximately 900 apparently monoclonal, translocation-bearing cells per 5 x 10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that some individuals who may be at risk for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> might be able to be identified by this PCR assay on peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, these data may help explain the age dependence of the occurrence of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
