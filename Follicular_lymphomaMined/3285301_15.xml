<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18) chromosomal translocation of human follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> recombines the candidate transforming gene bcl-2, located at 18q21, with the immunoglobulin (Ig) H-chain joining region (JH) at 14q32 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the consequences of this translocation, we cloned bcl-2 cDNAs from a pre-B cell line (Nall-1) and a t(14;18) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (SU-DHL-6) and compared these sequences with their genomic counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These studies revealed the complexity of bcl-2 gene expression in which six potential polyadenylation signals in exon 3 and two different 5' exons (exons 1 and 2) and promoters are alternatively used to generate different sized bcl-2 mRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A single open reading frame (ORF), at the junction of exons 2 and 3, predicts a 239 amino acid, 26 kD protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most chromosome 18 breakpoints cluster within a 150 bp region of exon 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In SU-DHL-6 the t(14;18) translocation juxtaposes a truncated bcl-2 gene with J6 in a tail-to-head configuration, resulting in the deregulated expression of chimeric bcl-2/Ig transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the SU-DHL-6 bcl-2 cDNA also contained several point mutations in the ORF, two of which altered the primary amino acid sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The deregulated expression of an altered bcl-2 gene may play a critical role in the disordered growth and differentiation of follicular B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
