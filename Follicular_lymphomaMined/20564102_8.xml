<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: External beam radiation therapy (RT) is the standard treatment for stage I-II, grade 1-2 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of an indolent natural history, some advocate alternative management strategies, including watchful waiting for this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relative improvement in outcomes for patients treated with and without RT has never been tested in randomized trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried for adult patients with stage I-II, grade 1-2 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosed from 1973 to 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Retrievable patient data included age, sex, race, stage, extranodal disease, and treatment with RT within the first year after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Actuarial overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 6568 patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DSS at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years in the RT group was 90%, 79%, 68%, and 63% versus 81%, 66%, 57%, and 51% in the no RT group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-0.68; P&lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>OS at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years in the RT group was 81%, 62%, 45%, and 35% versus 71%, 48%, 34%, and 23% in patients not receiving RT (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.63-0.73; P&lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, upfront RT remained independently associated with improved DSS (P&lt;.0001, Cox HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.57-0.72) and OS (P&lt;.0001; Cox HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.67-0.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> was the most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (52%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only 34% of patients received upfront RT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Upfront RT was associated with improved DSS and OS compared with alternate management approaches, a benefit that persisted over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This benefit suggests that watchful waiting with administration of salvage therapies on progression/relapse do not compensate for inadequate initial definitive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although it is the standard of care for this disease, RT for early stage low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is greatly underused in the US population; increased use of upfront RT could prevent thousands of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
