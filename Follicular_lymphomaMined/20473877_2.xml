<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined these associations among 411,097 participants of the European Prospective Investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 8.5 years, 1,334 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (1,267 non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and 67 Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consumption of red and processed meat, poultry, milk and dairy products was assessed by dietary questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazard regression was used to evaluate the association of the consumption of these food groups with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, the consumption of foods of animal origin was not associated with an increased risk of NHLS or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>, but the associations with specific subgroups of NHL entities were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A high intake of processed meat was associated with an increased risk of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCLL</z:e>) [relative risk (RR) per 50 g intake = 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-1.63], but a decreased risk of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) (RR = 0.58; CI 0.38-0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A high intake of poultry was related to an increased risk of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (RR = 1.22; CI 1.05-1.42 per 10 g intake), FL (RR = 1.65; CI 1.18-2.32) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCLL</z:e> (RR = 1.54; CI 1.18-2.01) in the continuous models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, no consistent associations between red and processed meat consumption and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> risk were observed, but we found that the consumption of poultry was related to an increased risk of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Chance is a plausible explanation of the observed associations, which need to be confirmed in further studies </plain></SENT>
