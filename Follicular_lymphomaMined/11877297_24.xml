<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intraclonal sequence diversity of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and their follicular growth pattern allows one to analyze <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell dissemination and the way the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasizes</z:e>" to distinct follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we analyzed individual follicles of 3 FLs by micromanipulation of single cells from individual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> follicles and amplification of immunoglobulin V region genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genealogical trees for the V(H) and the V(L) gene rearrangements were constructed to analyze the clonal relationship among individual cells of 3 distinct follicles of each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 cases there is evidence that distinct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> follicles are founded by many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, suggesting that there is extensive migration of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells among follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The observation that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells of FLs retain their follicular growth patterns despite this cellular migration supports the idea that they depend on the follicular microenvironment for their clonal expansion </plain></SENT>
