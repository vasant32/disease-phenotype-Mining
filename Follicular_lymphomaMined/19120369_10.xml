<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However the expression of BCL2 is not always homogeneous and may demonstrate a variable degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study analysed BCL2 protein expression pattern in 33 cases of t(14;18)-positive follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> using antibodies against two different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> (i.e. the widely used antibody BCL2/124 and an alternative antibody E17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>16/33 (49%) cases demonstrated strong BCL2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 10/33 (30%) cases, BCL2 expression was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and in some of these, its loss appeared to be correlated with cell proliferation, as indicated by Ki67 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Double immunofluorescence labelling confirmed an inverse BCL2/Ki67 relationship, where in 24/28 (86%) cases cellular expression of BCL2 and Ki67 was mutually exclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, seven BCL2 'pseudo-negative' cases were identified in which immunostaining was negative with antibody BCL2/124, but positive with antibody E17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA sequencing of these 'pseudo-negative' cases demonstrated eleven mutations in four cases and nine of these were missense mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It can be concluded that in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, despite carrying the t(14;18) translocations, BCL2 protein expression may be <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and loss of BCL2 could be related to cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Secondly, mutations in translocated BCL2 genes appear to be common and may cause BCL2 pseudo-negative immunostaining </plain></SENT>
