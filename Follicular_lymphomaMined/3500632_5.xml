<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polyclonal antibodies reactive with immunoglobulin chains and a panel of 16 monoclonal antibodies reactive with B- and T-cells, histiocytes, and epithelial cells were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to the Working Formulation, 5 cases were low grade, 12 intermediate grade, and 5 high grade; 1 case was an extramedullary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">plasmocytoma</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven percent were large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 13% follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 20 (86%) B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 2 T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; one case lacked detectable markers for B-, T-, or histiocytic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monoclonality was demonstrated in 13 out of the 20 B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, whereas the other 7 expressed pan-B antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that immunologic studies on frozen surgical material are of precise diagnostic value in gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, whereas fixed endoscopic biopsies only permit the distinction between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and undifferentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
