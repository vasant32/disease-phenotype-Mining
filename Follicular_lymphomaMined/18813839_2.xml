<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the 25-year unselected experience of a UK provincial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treatment centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This comprises of one of the largest series ever studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three patients were identified (56 initially presented as follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 5 with 'transformed' <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 2 with follicular and transformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from different biopsy sites) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age at presentation was 54 years (range 32-76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median time to transformation was 43 months (range 0-172) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the median overall survival was 76 months (range 8-254) and from transformation 10 months (range 1-166); 46 of 63 patients have died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For those whose transformation was initially treated with CHOP chemotherapy 10 were in complete remission (CR) and 14 were deceased (median survival 24, range 2-114 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five patients had high-dose chemotherapy and 3 were alive (at 25, 36 and 137 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that CHOP chemotherapy (probably with rituximab) is a reasonable first treatment in fit patients and high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support deserves further study </plain></SENT>
