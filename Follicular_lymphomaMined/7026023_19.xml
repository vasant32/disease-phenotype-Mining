<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two groups on the basis of the clinical follow-up information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first group consisted of 20 patients who were alive and disease-free at the end of five years without therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients in this group were classified as having florid reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> (FRFH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second group of 60 patients had progressive, recurrent, clinically active disease and were classified as having follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-six were dead of active disease, and 14 were alive with disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Various morphologic parameters were evaluated at low and high magnification, and statistical comparisons were made between FRFH and FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although several criteria were helpful in distinguishing FRFH from FL, the single most valuable criterion was the type of pattern encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follicles of variable size and shape lying adjacent to each other throughout the lymph node without or with very little intervening tissue are diagnostic of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This pattern was evident in 85% of the FL cases, but was not observed in any of the cases of FRFH </plain></SENT>
