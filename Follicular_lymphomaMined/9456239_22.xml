<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using information from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry that operates in the area and the Kaiser Permanente <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry, we identified 674 incident cases of NHL through 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We observed a positive association between smoking and risk of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (compared with nonsmokers: former smokers, relative risk = 1.9 with 95% confidence interval = 1.2-2.9; current smokers, relative risk = 1.4 with 95% confidence interval = 0.9-2.2), although the strength of the association did not increase consistently with increasing duration and intensity of smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed no relationship between smoking status and the risks of small cell lymphocytic, diffuse, or high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, nor was smoking related to the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> histological types of NHL combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results give limited evidence for a relationship between smoking and the risk of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
