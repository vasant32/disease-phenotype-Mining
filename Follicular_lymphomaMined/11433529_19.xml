<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By FISH and Southern blot analyses we identified a rearrangement in the MLL gene due to a novel t(3;11)(q28;q23) chromosomal translocation in a patient who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M5 3 years after treatment for a follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Through inverse PCR, the LPP (<z:hpo ids='HP_0012032'>lipoma</z:hpo> preferred partner) gene on 3q28 was identified as the MLL fusion partner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LPP contains substantial identity to the focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> protein, zyxin, and is frequently fused to HMGIC in <z:hpo ids='HP_0012032'>lipomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint occurred in intron 8 of MLL and LPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two in-frame MLL-LPP transcripts, which fuse MLL exon 8 to LPP exon 9, were detected by RT-PCR, although the smaller of these contained a deletion of 120 bp from the MLL sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The predicted MLL-LPP fusion protein includes the A/T hook motifs and methyltransferase domain of MLL joined to the two last LIM domains of LPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A reciprocal LPP-MLL transcript, predicted to include the proline-rich and leucine zipper motifs, and the first LIM domain of LPP were also detected by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, LPP is a newly identified MLL fusion partner in secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> resulting from topoisomerase inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The MLL-LPP and LPP-MLL predicted proteins contain many of the features present in other MLL rearrangements </plain></SENT>
