<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One such region of recurrent deletion is 6q16-q21; however, the specific genes affected have not been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective in this study was to identify cases with deletion of 6q16-q21 in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and to define a minimal region of deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A physical map of 6q16.2-q21 was constructed using map information from both sequence-based and <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> artificial chromosome (BAC) fingerprint-based maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-three BAC clones spanning a 6-Mb region of 6q16.2-q21 were identified and obtained from the RP-11 library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Selected BACs were fluorescence-labeled and hybridized to a series of 34 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with a regional 6q deletion detected by G banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four cases with deletion of the 6q16.3 region were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A minimal deletion of 2.3 Mb was defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study has identified a limited region of deletion of 6q16.3 that may implicate four known genes in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and possibly in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A BAC contig spanning a 6-Mb region has been anchored to the 6q16.2-q21 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This map represents a useful resource for gene identification in this region, not only in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but also in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> with 6q alterations </plain></SENT>
