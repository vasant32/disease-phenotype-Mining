<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate their utility in this latter setting, G-banded karyotyping was performed on 279 consecutive lymph node or tissue biopsy specimens with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complete cytogenetic studies were successfully obtained in 177 cases (63.4%), including 115 (69.3%) of 166 hematolymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Success rates varied with the specific diagnosis (range, 33%-100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The karyotypes were abnormal in 97 (84.3%) of the hematolymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In at least 3 cases of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the findings contributed directly to the specific diagnosis made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a much larger proportion of cases, characteristic but nonspecific findings were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities of suggested prognostic importance in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were identified in 14 (44%) of 32 cases and 8 (24%) of 33 cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most karyotyped <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> will display abnormal findings including many that are not completely specific but support the diagnosis, some that provide additional prognostic information, and, infrequently, some that help establish a diagnosis that might otherwise have been missed </plain></SENT>
