<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Progress has been slow in defining specific clinicopathological entities to this particular group of NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to elucidate the specific characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e>, a direct comparison of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e> with a group of diffuse B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DBCL) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between June 1983 and December 1987, we studied 114 adults with NHL, using a battery of immunophenotyping markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adult T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mycosis fungoides</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036920" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">SÃ©zary syndrome</z:e>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, well-differentiated lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and true histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were excluded from this study since these are distinct clinicopathologic entities with well-recognized immunophenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 75 patients, 70 who had adequate clinical information were analyzed, and of these, 34 were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e> and 36 were DBCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Classified according to the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute (NCI) Working Formulation (WF), 68% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e> and 31% of DBCL were high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory features were similar, except <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e> had a characteristic skin involvement and tended to present in more advanced stages with more constitutional symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Induction chemotherapy was homogeneous in both groups, and complete remission rates were 62% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e> and 67% for DBCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with DBCL had a better overall survival than patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e>, but the survival benefit disappeared after patients were stratified according to intermediate- or high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e> patients who had received less intensive induction chemotherapy was found to have a very unfavorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that (1) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e> follows the general grading concept proposed in WF classification; (2) within a given intermediate or high grade, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e> and DBCL respond comparably to treatment; (3) the intensity of induction chemotherapy has a crucial impact on the outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e> patients; and (4) with a few exceptions, the clinical and laboratory features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e> and DBCL are comparable </plain></SENT>
