<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The t(14;18) is the most frequent chromosomal aberration observed in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), and is less frequent in diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2/IgH rearrangement constitutes good target for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection that allows to find out one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell in 100,000 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The PCR assay was used to detect bcl-2-rearranged cells in blood and bone marrow (BM) in 63 previously untreated patients with DLCL and in 53 patients with FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty five FL patients (47%) and 9 DLCL patients (14%) had PCR-detectable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in BM and peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">Minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) was evaluated in 17 FL and 5 DLCL patients undergoing first-line chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three DLCL patients (60%) but only 1 FL (6%) patient achieved molecular response (PCR-negative status in BM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two PCR bcl-2/IgH positive patients with FL were treated with rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) and had no PCR-detectable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in BM after the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) were harvested in 5 FL (1 PCR-negative) and in 2 DLCL (1 PCR-negative) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PCR-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells contamined PBSC in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with BM PCR-positivity before harvesting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five FL patients underwent autologous transplantation (AT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No bcl-2/IgH positive cells were detected in 4 patients (80%) at any point after AT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient achieved molecular response after rituximab treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients are in CR 6, 22, 30, 31 and 42 months respectively, after AT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, 4 FL patients in clinical complete remission, but with persistent PCR positivity in BM relapsed with median of 21 months (interval, 14-28 months) from the end of a first-line chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thus, the results show that PCR detection of the bcl-2/IgH rearrangement is a very useful method in evaluating the BM infiltration by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells especially in the situation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Conventional chemotherapy did not eradicate bcl-2 positive cells in BM in most of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, but autologous transplantation or rituximab immunotherapy can induce molecular response in a significant proportion of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our results support the previous observations of the molecular response importance in view of better disease free and probably also overall survival </plain></SENT>
