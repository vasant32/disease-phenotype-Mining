<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regulation of bcl-2 gene expression was investigated in neoplastic lymphoid cell lines containing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> #18 chromosomes or a t(14;18) translocation with regard to steady-state <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> stability, transcription rates, and DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High steady-state levels of bcl-2 mRNA, and proportionally high rates of bcl-2 transcription (measured in isolated nuclei), were found in B cell lines containing t(14;18) translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The half-life of bcl-2 mRNA (approximately 2-3 hr) was similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines examined, including a t(14;18)-containing follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, which has a translocated and rearranged bcl-2 gene that produces bcl-2/Ig fusion transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> (inhibitor of protein synthesis), the half-life of some of the bcl-2/Ig <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> produced by these cells was prolonged, indicating that in some circumstances <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> stability may contribute to deregulated bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite stabilizing some bcl-2 mRNAs, the overall effect of treating cell lines with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> was a reduction in the levels of accumulated bcl-2 mRNAs through inhibition of bcl-2 gene transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These latter data provide indirect evidence that short-lived transacting factor(s) regulate transcription of the human bcl-2 gene in lymphoid cells with or without a t(14;18) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No clear correlation was discovered between bcl-2 gene methylation and transcription </plain></SENT>
