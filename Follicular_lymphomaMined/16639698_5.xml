<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBI3 was recently found to associate with a novel <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, p28, to form a new heterodimeric cytokine, called interleukin-27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated EBI3 and p28 expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human B lymphocytes and in non-EBV-associated B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Low levels of EBI3 were detected in purified tonsillar B cells and expression was upregulated upon anti-CD40 or anti-micro stimulation via NF-kappaB activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In non-neoplastic tissues, EBI3 expression by lymphocytes was largely restricted to a subset of germinal centre (GC) B cells located at the margin of the light zone, in close contact with CD3+ T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over 50% of EBI3+ GC B cells were engaged in cell proliferation as assessed by Ki67 expression, and 10-30% expressed MUM1, an early marker of plasma cell differentiation expressed by late centrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Many EBI3+ GC B cells had downregulated bcl-6 expression, which further suggests that these cells correspond to late CD40-activated centrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of 64 B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> showed that the highest EBI3 levels were detected in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of both GC B-cell-like or non-GC B-cell-like types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No or rare p28 expression was detected in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This constitutive expression of EBI3 by neoplastic B cells may be involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e>, and may be a useful marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
