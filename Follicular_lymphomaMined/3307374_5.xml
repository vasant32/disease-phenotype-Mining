<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In each instance, the diagnosis of theoretically "florid" progressive transformation of germinal centers (PTGC) was made or considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The features that separate this pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> with PTGC include involvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nodules without the presence of any reactive germinal centers, a homogeneous proliferation of large transformed lymphocytes with a markedly decreased or absent population of phagocytic histiocytes, and extension by abnormal cells into the perinodal adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If the desirability of frozen section tissue immunophenotyping is anticipated, these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> would be distinguished from PTGC by monotypic staining for light chains </plain></SENT>
