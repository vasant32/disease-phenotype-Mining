<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Beyond the morphological, immunophenotypic, and genetic information used for the diagnosis of lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, molecular analyses have deepened our insights into the development of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have learned that B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> can be grouped according to the mutational status of their immunoglobulin variable (V) region genes, and this has become an important prognostic tool in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The analysis of V genes also has allowed us to more precisely place B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> relative to their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cell counterparts and to the germinal center where somatic hypermutation takes place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has become evident that many of the common B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> arise at this site and are able to respond to stimuli, which govern <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this chapter, we focus on the analysis of V genes in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> based on the experience in our laboratory and provide a detailed guide for this analysis </plain></SENT>
