<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: A pilot study was undertaken to evaluate the potential for subcutaneous dosing with 2(nd) generation anti-CD20 antibody veltuzumab in patients with CD20(+) indolent non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with previously untreated or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relapsed disease</z:e> received 4 doses of 80, 160, or 320 mg veltuzumab injected subcutaneously every two weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Responses were assessed by computed tomography scans, with other evaluations including adverse events, safety laboratories, B-cell blood levels, serum veltuzumab levels, and human anti-veltuzumab antibody (HAHA) titers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen patients (14 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; 13 stage III or IV disease; 5 treatment-naive) completed treatment with only occasional, mild-moderate, transient injection reactions and no other safety issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subcutaneous veltuzumab demonstrated a slow release pattern over several days, achieving a mean Cmax of 19, 25 and 63 Î¼g/mL at 80, 160, and 320 mg doses for a total of 4 administrations, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>Depletion</z:mpath> of circulating B cells occurred after the first injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The objective response rate (partial responses plus complete responses plus complete responses unconfirmed) was 47% (8/17) with a complete response/complete response unconfirmed rate of 24% (4/17); 4 of 8 objective responses continued for 60 weeks or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> serum samples evaluated for human anti-veltuzumab antibody were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous injections of low-dose veltuzumab are convenient, well tolerated, and capable of achieving sustained serum levels, B-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, and durable objective responses in indolent non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
