<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A case of plasma-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> with increased numbers of abnormal cells in the circulation also showed reduced transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the presence in the circulation of abnormal lymphocytes (or plasma cells) accounts for the results in CLL and FLL, WM and plasma-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In WM a correlation was found between the activity of the disease (expressed by the levels of IgM paraprotein) and the degree of blast transformation.The long-term (28 days) in vitro survival of lymphocytes using subconcentrations of PHA was also studied in 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cell populations (PHA-non-responsive) of CLL and FLL, but not of WM, had a good in vitro survival, resembling in this respect the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> PHA-responsive population of lymphocytes, but they remained PHA-non-responsive after 4 weeks' culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is speculated that in CLL the long survival in vitro of the PHA-non-responsive (leukaemic) population corresponds to their long life-span in vivo </plain></SENT>
