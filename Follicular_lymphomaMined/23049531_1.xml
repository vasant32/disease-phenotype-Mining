<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follicular dendritic cells (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi>) are unique immune cells that contribute to the regulation of humoral immune responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cells are located in the B-cell follicles of secondary lymphoid tissues where they trap and retain antigens (Ags) in the form of highly immunogenic immune complexes (ICs) consisting of Ag plus specific antibody (Ab) and/or complement proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> multimerize Ags and present them polyvalently to B-cells in periodically arranged arrays that extensively crosslink the B-cell receptors for Ag (BCRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi>-FcÎ³RIIB mediates IC periodicity, and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi>-Ag presentation combined with other soluble and membrane bound signals contributed by <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi>, like <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi>-BAFF, -IL-6, and -C4bBP, are essential for the induction of the germinal center (GC) reaction, the maintenance of serological memory, and the remarkable ability of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi>-Ags to induce specific Ab responses in the absence of cognate T-cell help </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> play a negative role in several disease conditions including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, HIV/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162534" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prion diseases</z:e>, and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to other accessory immune cells, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> have received little attention, and their functions have not been fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This review gives an overview of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> structure, and recapitulates our current knowledge on the immunoregulatory functions of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> in health and disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDCs</z:chebi> should permit better regulation of Ab responses to suit the therapeutic manipulation of regulated and dysregulated immune responses </plain></SENT>
