<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few studies have examined associations for dietary patterns, which may more accurately reflect patterns of consumption and the complexity of dietary intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to examine whether dietary patterns identified by factor analysis were associated with NHL risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case-control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Population-based sample residing in Nebraska from 1999 to 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: A total of 336 cases and 460 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Factor analysis identified two major dietary patterns: (i) a 'Meat, Fat and Sweets' dietary pattern characterized by high intakes of French fries, red meat, processed meat, pizza, salty snacks, sweets and desserts, and sweetened beverages; and (ii) a 'Fruit, Vegetables and <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">Starch</z:chebi>' dietary pattern characterized by high intakes of vegetables, fruit, fish, and cereals and starches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariable logistic regression models, the 'Meat, Fat and Sweets' dietary pattern was associated with an increased risk of overall NHL (ORQ4 v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Q1 = 3·6, 95 % CI 1·9, 6·8; P trend = 0·0004), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ORQ4 v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Q1 = 3·1, 95 % CI 1·2, 8·0; P trend = 0·01), diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ORQ4 v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Q1 = 3·2, 95 % CI 1·1, 9·0; P trend = 0·09) and marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ORQ4 v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Q1 = 8·2, 95 % CI 1·3, 51·2; P trend = 0·05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No association with overall or subtype-specific risk was detected for the 'Fruit, Vegetables and <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">Starch</z:chebi>' dietary pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was detected across strata of age, sex, BMI, smoking status or alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a dietary pattern high in meats, fats and sweets may be associated with an increased risk of NHL </plain></SENT>
