<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: PCR is the primary method for detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One such gene target is the bcl-2/immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) translocation found in a majority of cases of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We report an accurate method for quantitative detection of the bcl-2/IgH translocation marker of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in a series of patients in various stages of remission and relapse who had been treated with a combination of ifosfamide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (MINE) chemotherapy and monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody (Rituximab) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The approach uses seminested PCR followed by analysis of the products on a fluorescent capillary electrophoresis system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The quantitation of bcl-2/IgH translocation-positive cells was sensitive and reproducible, capable of detecting as few as five malignant cells out of 300,000 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Quantitative PCR enables one to monitor the kinetics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> reduction in patients treated with MINE chemotherapy in combination with Rituximab </plain></SENT>
