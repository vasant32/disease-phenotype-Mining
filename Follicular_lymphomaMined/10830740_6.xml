<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients developed <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement during their disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence was 7.9% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients studied and 17.0% of the patients with serum LDH concentration &gt; or = two times the upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (2N) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By univariate analysis, stage IV disease (P = .023), a serum LDH concentration &gt; or = 2 N (P = .009), and bone marrow involvement (P = .016) were risk factors for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified a serum LDH concentration &gt; or = 2 N (P = .032) as an independent predictor for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 12 patients who developed <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement were among the 126 patients with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, whereas none of the 17 patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> developed <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement, although the difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median survival of the patients with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement was only 4.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a serum LDH concentration &gt; or = 2N at presentation is a significant predictive factor for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement for NHL patients without lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and small noncleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we would suggest that <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> prophylaxis should be considered for patients with a serum LDH concentration &gt; or = 2N at presentation and diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> once a complete remission is achieved </plain></SENT>
