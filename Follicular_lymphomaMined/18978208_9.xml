<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although approximately 85% of FLs harbor the translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21) and consistently display a follicular growth pattern, predominantly diffuse FLs are less well characterized on the phenotypical, molecular, and clinical level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 35 predominantly diffuse FL by immunohistochemistry, classical chromosome banding analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and gene expression profiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 28 of 29 analyzable cases lacked t(14;18), and 27 of 29 cases revealed a unifying chromosomal aberration, a deletion in 1p36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphologically, 12 FLs were grade 1 and 23 were grade 2, and the immunophenotype with frequent expression of CD10, BCL6, and CD23 was in line with a germinal center B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The gene expression profiles of 4 predominantly diffuse FLs fell into the spectrum of typical FL, with a unique enrichment of specific gene signatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, patients with diffuse FL frequently presented with low clinical stage and large but localized inguinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that predominantly diffuse FL represent a distinct subtype of t(14;18)-negative nodal FL with a unifying genetic alteration (deletion of 1p36) and characteristic clinical features </plain></SENT>
