<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We show here that a variant t(2;18)(p11;q21) translocation observed in a case of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> leads to the juxtaposition of a J kappa segment to a chromosome 18 transcriptional unit located 10 kpb upstream of the BCL-2 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cDNA of this new evolutionarily conserved gene, termed FVT-1 for follicular-variant-translocation gene, codes for a putatively secreted protein of 36 Kd that is not homologous with any described protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The FVT-1 gene is weakly expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the analyzed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic tissues but a very high rate of transcription is observed in some T-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proximity of FVT-1 to the BCL-2 locus suggests that in the t(14;18) currently observed in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, both genes would participate in the tumoral process </plain></SENT>
