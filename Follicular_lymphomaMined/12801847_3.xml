<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The International Prognostic Index (IPI), initially designed for aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, has been successfully used in patients with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Italian <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Intergroup (ILI) created a new prognostic index specific for FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare which of these two indices is more useful when applied to a large group of FL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Both indices, IPI (age &gt;60 years, extranodal involvement &gt;=2 sites, elevated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase, ECOG &gt;=2, stage &gt;=3) and ILI (age &gt;60 years, extranodal involvement &gt;=2 sites, elevated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase, male sex, B symptoms, erythrocyte sedimentation rate &gt;=30 mm 1(st) hour) were calculated in a group of 398 FL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) associated with each prognostic group were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall concordance between both indices was 73% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to the IPI 122 patients (31%) were in the higher risk group, whereas according to the ILI 132 (33%) were; concordance between the high risk groups was 66% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 10-years OS and PFS rates after applying the IPI system were 73% and 37%, respectively, in the low risk groups; 47% and 26%, in the intermediate risk groups and 25% and 2%, in the high risk groups (log-rank=69.2 and 41.3, respectively; p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to ILI index the 10-year OS and PFS were 60% and 34%, respectively, in the low risk groups; 59% and 30%, in the intermediate risk groups and 17% and 0%, in the high risk groups (log-rank=86.6 and 58.5, respectively; p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Both the IPI and ILI index, are useful for classifying FL patients into different risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although it seems that the ILI index has a higher discriminating power among groups, significant differences were not observed in identifying FL patients with a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
