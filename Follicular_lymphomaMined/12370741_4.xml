<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is reported that overexpression of hnRNP A2 and B1 proteins is useful for detecting early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, and that B1, a splicing minor isoform of A2, is more specific than A2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The B1 expression is still undetermined in human lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We quantitatively studied the B1 expression in 85 lymph node specimens, comprising reactive <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> (RLH; n=8), B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=23), T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=22), and metastatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (n=32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining and immunoblotting analyses with an anti-B1 monoclonal antibody, 2B2 were performed, and the two sets of results correlated with each other (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In RLH specimens, B1 expression rate was significantly higher in follicular centers (FC; 44%) than in mantle zone (MZ; 15%) and paracortex (16%) (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>B1 expression was statistically higher in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> than in T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, B1 expression rates were 51% in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLBL; n=5) and 45% in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL; n=16), and they were almost the same as that of the FC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Especially in DLBLs, CD10+ FC-origin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> expressed greater amount of B1 than CD10- non-FC-origin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>B1 expression rate was low in mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>; n=2) and similar to that of MZ in RLH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that B1 expression is associated with differentiation in lymphoid tissue rather than transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>B1 expression increases during the process of B-cell differentiation in the FC, and that high B1 expression is maintained in B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e>, especially in cells of FC-origin DLBL </plain></SENT>
