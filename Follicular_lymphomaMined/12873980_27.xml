<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Activation-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminase (AID) is essential for somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination of the immunoglobulin (IG) genes in B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has recently been proposed that AID, as the newly identified DNA mutator in man, may be instrumental in initiation and progression of B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (B-NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We quantitatively measured, by real-time reverse-transcription PCR, expression of AID and of the error-prone DNA polymerase iota in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells and a comprehensive panel of B-NHL entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In pre- and postgerminal center (GC)-type B-NHLs like in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> naive and memory cells, AID did not exceed background levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, half of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> tested were found to express AID, at most at levels comparable with those found in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GC B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty percent of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> also transcribed AID, some at supraphysiological levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases, only 25% expressed significant amounts of AID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, within the group of GC-type B-NHLs, a statistically significant correlation between AID and polymerase iota expression was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By contrast, we observed no correlation between AID expression and mutation load neither with the degree of intraclonal diversity of IG variable heavy chain genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in two of seven follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with clinical and histological progression, selective outgrowth of AID-expressing clones occurred, suggestive for a role of the somatic diversification machinery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> transformation </plain></SENT>
