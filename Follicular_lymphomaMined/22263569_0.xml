<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TK1 has been reported as a reliable prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, but has not yet been tested in large populations of patients with non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the prognostic significance of TK1 levels was assessed in 170 prospectively enrolled patients with previously untreated follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The TK1 level at the time of treatment initiation was shown to correlate with the clinical stage, Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) score, β(2)-microglobulin level, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase level and B symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found with FL grade or Ki-67 proliferation index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis identified high TK1 levels (≥ 15I U/L) as a prognostic factor for overall survival (hazard ratio 2.91, p = 0.019) and progression-free survival (hazard ratio 1.94, p = 0.022) independent of FLIPI score variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, TK1 levels may help to refine risk assessment in the modern immunotherapy era </plain></SENT>
