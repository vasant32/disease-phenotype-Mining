<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using immunostaining for the inducible enzyme/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule tissue transglutaminase (TG), we demonstrate coordinate regulation of multiple stromal cell types of this reticular network including FRC, endothelial cells and sinus lining cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tissue transglutaminase is expressed at low levels in the paracortex around primary follicles but is markedly up-regulated in stromal cells around hyperplastic germinal centers and then down-regulated around regressing follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In cultured FRC, TG is induced 5- to 20-fold and becomes colocalized with matrix proteins by treatment with interleukin-4, but not by other cytokines that are commonly increased in lymph upon immune activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coordinate TG up-regulation is observed surrounding nodules of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (14 of 15 cases) and in the FRC and endothelium of classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types that also showed an activated paracortical phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed minimal TG staining, with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> types showing patterns suggesting differential TG regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using TG as a stromal marker, we have identified differential modulation of the phenotype of the lymph node reticular network that parallels change in the B-cell compartment </plain></SENT>
