<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of total-lymphoid irradiation (TLI) to a total dose of about 4,000 rad in 61 patients or whole-body irradiation (WBI) followed by boost irradiation to sites of involvement in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, 13 patients treated with TLI received adjuvant chemotherapy, consisting of six cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CVP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 9.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier actuarial survival at five, ten, and 15 years was 78%, 50%, and 37%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Freedom from relapse at five and ten years was 60% and 40% with no relapses after ten years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a prospective randomized study of 16 patients who <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> underwent staging laparotomy comparing TLI with or without adjuvant chemotherapy with CVP, there was no significant difference in either survival or freedom from relapse between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with limited stage III disease (without B symptoms, less than five sites of involvement, and maximum size of disease less than 10 cm) had an excellent prognosis with a 15-year survival and freedom from relapse of 100% and 88%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Radiation therapy may be a potentially curative modality in patients with stage III follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
