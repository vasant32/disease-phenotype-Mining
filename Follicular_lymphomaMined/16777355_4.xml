<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mbr forms a triplex DNA structure under physiological conditions and the transcription factor special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 1 (SATB1) binds immediately downstream of the mbr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These observations raise the possibility that the mbr may be involved in regulation of bcl-2 gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of the bcl-2 mbr on reporter gene activity and the relevance of SATB1 to this function in a variety of cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the mbr up-regulated reporter gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Deletion of the 37-bp AT-rich SATB1 binding site abolished the bcl-2 mbr regulation of reporter gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of SATB1 enhanced bcl-2 mbr up-regulation of the reporter gene activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data strongly demonstrated that the bcl-2 mbr possessed regulatory function that was related to SATB1 </plain></SENT>
