<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent data suggest an alternative breakpoint cluster region (ABR) located between 245 and 285 kb 5' of BCL6, which might be associated with Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> and 9 FLs grade 3B with cytogenetic rearrangements at 3q27 were studied by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to discriminate between breakpoints at the ABR and MBR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> contained a breakpoint in the MBR, and 6 FL grade 3B (FL3B) cases contained a breakpoint in the ABR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No specific chromosomal partners could be identified in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Previously published data have suggested that FL3B cases with 3q27 aberrations are closely related to the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> of germinal center cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, our findings suggest that the mechanism of 3q27 rearrangement in FL3B cases is similar to the mechanism in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> grade 1,2, and 3A cases </plain></SENT>
