<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the usefulness of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), p53 protein expression and transformed lymphocyte count (TLC) as adjunctive tests to differentiate indolent small B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in fine needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Aspirates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> from April 1993 to January 1997 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The percentage of TLCs was determined on the Papanicolaou smear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentage and intensity of p53 and PCNA immunocytochemical staining was evaluated on cell block sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results were compared and correlated with the final diagnoses based on available <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, flow cytometry and clinical history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 40 cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 12 reactive lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adequate cell blocks were available on 16 large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 7 grade 1-2 follicular center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 6 mucosal associated lymphoid tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 2 small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 2 mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Average TLC and p53 nuclear staining was highest in large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (57% TLC and 24% p53), followed by grades 1 and 2 follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (14% TLC and 15% p53) and lowest in other indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (&lt; 10% TLC and &lt; 1% p53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Average PCNA staining was highest in large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (46%) and lowest in small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (7%); however, TLC was the best parameter for differentiating large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from indolent small B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TLC differentiated large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from indolent small B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> better than either p53 or PCNA alone or in combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant overlap between categories limits usefulness of these immunocytochemical stains for differentiating these entities </plain></SENT>
