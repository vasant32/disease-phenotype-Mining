<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-containing regimen administered alone or in combination with interferon alfa-2b (IFNalpha) in patients with low-grade follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) and poor prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred sixty-eight patients with advanced-stage FL received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, teniposide, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHVP) monthly for 6 months, then every 2 months for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After randomization, 242 patients were evaluated for efficacy: 119 received CHVP alone, and 123 also received IFNalpha at a dose of 5 million units three times weekly for 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a 6-year median follow-up, the patients treated with CHVP + IFNalpha showed significantly longer median PFS than those who received CHVP alone (2.9 years v 1.5 years, respectively; P = .0002) and significantly longer median OS (not reached v 5.6 years, respectively; P = .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although some side effects, which included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, asthenia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, elevated serum transaminase levels, flu-like symptoms, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, were more frequently observed in patients who received the combination regimen, these reactions were moderate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IFNalpha was withdrawn because of toxicity in 10% of the patients, and a dosage reduction or temporary suspension was required in 28% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: With long-term follow-up of 6 years, these results confirm that the addition of IFNalpha to a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-containing regimen for patients with advanced-stage and clinically aggressive FL not only increased PFS, as in most other similar trials, but also prolonged OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was moderate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effects of this combined chemotherapy and IFNalpha regimen on OS probably reflect the selection of FL patients with poor prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
