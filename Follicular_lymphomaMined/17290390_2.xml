<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the interaction between occupational <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> exposure and atopy on risk of NHL in an Australian population-based case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incident cases (n = 694) were diagnosed in New South Wales or the Australian Capital Territory between 2000 and 2001 and controls (n = 694) were randomly selected from electoral rolls and frequency-matched to cases by age, sex and state of residence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Occupational <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> exposure was determined by an expert occupational hygienist's assessment of job-specific questionnaires administered by telephone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>History of atopy (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo>, hay <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>eczema</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016470" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">food allergy</z:e>) was self-reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models included the three matching variables, ethnicity and sun exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The OR for NHL with substantial <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> exposure and any history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> was 3.07 (95% CI 0.55-17.10) and with substantial <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> exposure and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> history it was 4.23 (95% CI 1.76-10.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The p-value for interaction was 0.29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A similar pattern of risk was observed for each of the <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> subtypes; for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> at various times of life; for hay <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>eczema</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016470" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">food allergy</z:e> and any atopy, in men only and for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although this study had limited power, the findings do not suggest modification of the association between <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> exposure and NHL risk by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857523" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atopic disease</z:e> more generally </plain></SENT>
