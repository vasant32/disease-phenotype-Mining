<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to assess the contribution of rituximab in the actual clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with newly diagnosed mature B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated at 20 National Hospital Organization hospitals from January 2000 to December 2004 were consecutively registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rituximab was approved in September 2002 for indolent B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in September 2003 for aggressive B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two groups depending on whether they received induction therapy containing rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The endpoint was to evaluate the rituximab benefit based on 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and 2-year overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total 1126 patients received chemotherapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, 762 were diagnosed as diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and 215 as follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PFS and OS were markedly improved in the rituximab group compared with the non-rituximab group in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (both P &lt; 0.001) and in patients with FL (P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.003 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rituximab, when used for remission induction therapy, significantly improved the clinical outcome of the mature B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patient in actual clinical practice </plain></SENT>
