We report the case of a 1-month-old boy with an unusual association of supraventricular tachycardia and anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery. Although signs of infarction were visible on the first electrocardiogram, the presence of an arrhythmia did not immediately suggest a coronary anomaly. Echocardiography allowed the diagnosis, thus leading to appropriate care.
