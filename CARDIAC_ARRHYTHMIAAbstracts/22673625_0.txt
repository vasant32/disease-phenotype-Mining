 INTRODUCTION: Even though ictal tachyarrhythmias are more common, ictal brady-asystole is more likely to be fatal, and yet is potentially preventable with pacemaker (PM) implantation. We sought to quantify the degree of association of PM placement in people with and without epilepsy, including neurological and cardiovascular cohorts. METHODS: Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of the National Hospital Discharge database using International Classification of Diseases Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. We identified people with and without epilepsy between 1990 and 2006. The epilepsy cohort was compared to patients without epilepsy and other cardiovascular and central nervous system (CNS) disease cohorts. RESULTS: People with epilepsy had higher odds of temporary PM (TPM; OR 1.6) than patients without epilepsy, especially amongst males (OR 2.0), young- (OR 4.6) and middle-aged (OR 4.3) patients. The epilepsy cohort had significantly higher odds of TPM than demyelinating disease (OR 7.9) and migraine (OR 9.1) cohorts. Compared to stroke, people with epilepsy had higher odds of TPM in the male (OR 1.6) and middle-age (OR 2.4) subgroups. No significant association was seen with permanent PM (PPM). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the high likelihood of TPM placement in epilepsy patients as compared to cohorts without epilepsy. Significant associations were seen especially in males and young- and middle-aged patients. Since demyelinating and migraine cohorts are somewhat similar to epilepsy patients in age and sex characteristics, the higher odds of TPM in epilepsy patients may be related to the disease mechanism causing brady-asystole; however this requires further study.
