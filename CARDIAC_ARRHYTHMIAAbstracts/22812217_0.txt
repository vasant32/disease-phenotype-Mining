 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the immunohistochemical distributions and expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the model of rat myocardial ischemia. METHODS: The model of myocardial ischemia was established by ligating the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery of rats. The changes of VEGF expression were detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot at time points after myocardial ischemia. The electrocardiographic changes were evaluated uninterruptedly. RESULTS: The expression of VEGF was not be found in control group. Fifteen minutes after LAD ligation, weak positive expression of VEGF were found in the ischemic myocardium. The expression of VEGF reached the peak at 3 hours after ligation. The VEGF distribution was mainly localized in the ischemic and peri-ischemic regions. Six hours after LAD ligation, the expression of VEGF decreased comparing with 3 hours and showed a relatively higher level. Fatal arrhythmia was found in nine rats by the electrocardiograph. CONCLUSION: The immunohistochemical staining of VEGF could be helpful for investigating the location and severity of acute myocardial ischemia. Fatal arrhythmia may be secondary to myocardial ischemia.
