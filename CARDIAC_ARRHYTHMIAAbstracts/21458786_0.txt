This paper illustrates a method for time-plane feature extraction from digitized ECG sample using statistical approach. The algorithm detects the position and magnitude of the QRS complex, P and T wave for a single lead ECG dataset. The processing is broadly based on relative comparison of magnitude and slopes of ECG samples. Then the baseline modulation in the dataset is removed. The R-peak detection and baseline modulation is tested MIT-BIH arrhythmia database as well as 12-lead datasets in MIT-PTB database (PTBDB) and available under Physionet. The overall accuracy obtained is more than 99%.
