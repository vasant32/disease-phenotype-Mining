 AIMS: Functional mitral regurgitation (MR) could be managed by both cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) and mitral-valve surgery. Clinical decision making regarding the appropriateness of mitral-valve surgery vs. CRT is a challenging task. This study assessed the prevalence and prognosis of various degrees of functional MR in CRT candidates. Additionally, we sought to identify functional MR patients who either can be adequately managed by CRT only or will need surgery. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiac resynchronization therapy recipients (n= 794) were followed-up for 26 ± 18 months. Mitral regurgitation severity was quantified on scale 0-4. Cardiac resynchronization therapy responders were identified based on improvement in the New York Heart Association class and left-ventricular ejection fraction. Severity of MR and LV reverse remodelling were assessed at 3 and 12 months. Predictors of long-term MR change and CRT response were explored with multivariable models. Mitral regurgitation was present in 86%, with 35% prevalence of advanced MR (grade 3-4). Improvement of MR ≥ 1° after 12 months occurred in 46% of patients. It was relatively more frequent in patients with advanced MR at baseline (63%, P< 0.01). Baseline MR severity and change in MR at 3-month follow-up predicted response to CRT. Patients with ≥ 1° MR improvement at 12 months had more reverse remodelling compared with those with no change or worsening of MR. CONCLUSIONS: Mitral regurgitation improvement at 3 months predicts CRT response and MR improvement at 12-month follow-up. This finding could have implications for subsequent MR surgical therapies.
