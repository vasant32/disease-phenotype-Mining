 AIMS: Ventricular arrhythmias arising from the fibrous rings have been demonstrated, but knowledge about the aortomitral continuity (AMC) as a source of the arrhytmias is still limited. The objective is to describe the characteristics of ventricular arrhythmias originating from the AMC in patients without structural heart disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and/or premature ventricular contractions, who had been successfully treated by catheter ablation at the AMC beneath the aortic valve, were enrolled. Clinical data and electrocardiographic characteristics were analysed. Three of the 10 patients had previously registered episodes of supraventricular tachycardia and had undergone catheter ablation of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). In four patients with anterior AMC location, early R/S wave transition was found in the precordial leads, with equal R and S amplitudes in V2, rS in V1, and R in V3. In six patients whose VT arose from the middle part of the AMC, we demonstrated a special ('rebound') transition pattern, with which equal R and S amplitudes occurred in V2, and high R waves in V1 and V3. In the anterior AMC location, the S/R ratios in leads V1 and V2 were >1 and statistically significantly higher than those located in the middle (V1: 1.59 vs. 0.23, P< 0.001; V2: 1.52 vs. 0.41, P< 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We report a series of ventricular arrhythmias arising from the AMC with different R/S wave transition patterns in the precordial leads on the electrocardiogram. There may be a relationship between ventricular arrhythmias from AMC and AVNRT.
