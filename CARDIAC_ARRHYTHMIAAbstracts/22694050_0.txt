Isolated left ventricular apical hypoplasia is a newly recognized type of cardiomyopathy, with only a few cases reported since it was first described in 2004. We report this case of a 21-year-old Filipino female presenting with unstable supraventricular arrhythmia and heart failure, with characteristic features of isolated left ventricular apical hypoplasia on echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. To our knowledge, this is the first reported adult case in Asia.
