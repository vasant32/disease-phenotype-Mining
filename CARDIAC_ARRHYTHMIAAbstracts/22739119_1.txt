 AIMS: Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is an inheritable and life-threatening disease; however, it is often difficult to determine disease characteristics in sporadic cases with novel mutations, and more precise analysis is necessary for the successful development of evidence-based clinical therapies. This study thus sought to better characterize ion channel cardiac disorders using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). METHODS AND RESULTS: We reprogrammed somatic cells from a patient with sporadic LQTS and from controls, and differentiated them into cardiomyocytes through embryoid body (EB) formation. Electrophysiological analysis of the LQTS-iPSC-derived EBs using a multi-electrode array (MEA) system revealed a markedly prolonged field potential duration (FPD). The IKr blocker E4031 significantly prolonged FPD in control- and LQTS-iPSC-derived EBs and induced frequent severe arrhythmia only in LQTS-iPSC-derived EBs. The IKs blocker chromanol 293B did not prolong FPD in the LQTS-iPSC-derived EBs, but significantly prolonged FPD in the control EBs, suggesting the involvement of IKs disturbance in the patient. Patch-clamp analysis and immunostaining confirmed a dominant-negative role for 1893delC in IKs channels due to a trafficking deficiency in iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that iPSCs could be useful to characterize LQTS disease as well as drug responses in the LQTS patient with a novel mutation. Such analyses may in turn lead to future progress in personalized medicine.
