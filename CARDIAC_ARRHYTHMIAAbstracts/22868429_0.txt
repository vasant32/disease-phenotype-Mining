Recentry, surgical candidates have become older and have more surgical risk factors, perioperative patient management become more important than before. In the patients with significant arrhythmia observed in the preoperative period, examination of the baseline heart disease, i.e. myocardial ischemia or congestive heart failure, is mandatory and, if necessary, adequate treatment such as defibrillator, the implantation of a pacemaker, anticoagulation therapy, or other medical therapy should be performed. In the patients with atrial fibrillation, clinical prediction rules such as the congestive heart failure, hypertension, age>75, diabetes, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) [CHADS 2] score have been developed to identify those patients at highest risk for thrombo-embolism and can be used when assessing the need for bridging anticoagulation by heparin prior to surgery. The electrical stimulus from electrocautery may inhibit demand pacemakers or may reprogram the pacemaker. An asynchronous or non-sensing pacemaker mode is recommended in patients who are pacemaker dependent and whose underlying rhythm is unreliable. The device has to be checked to ensure appropriate programming and sensing pacing thresholds after surgery. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator should be turned off during surgery and switched on in the recovery phase before discharge to the ward.
