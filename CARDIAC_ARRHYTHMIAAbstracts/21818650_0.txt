A 6-year-old girl with type 3 long QT syndrome was safely and successfully implanted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) system. Prior to implantation, she had experienced uncontrollable life-threatening arrhythmia in spite of high-dose administration of mexiletine. An ICD coil lead for transvenous use was placed in the intrapericardial and retrocardial space and was connected to a generator placed in front of the posterior sheath of the right abdominal rectal muscle. Administration of a beta-blocker in addition to atrial pacing almost completely eliminated the patient's life-threatening arrhythmia attacks. Intrapericardial and retrocardial implantation of ICD coil leads might be useful for children.
