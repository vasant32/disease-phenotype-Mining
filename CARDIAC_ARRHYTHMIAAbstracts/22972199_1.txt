 BACKGROUND: Right atrial (RA) appendage (RAA) pacing is reported to impair hemodynamic benefits of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) through a considerable delay of left atrial (LA) contraction, which compromises appropriate balance of atrioventricular (AV) and left ventricular (LV) synchrony. Potential usefulness of Bachmann's bundle (BB) pacing to solve the problem remains to be confirmed. METHODS AND RESULTS: Atrial synchrony and LV performance was investigated by echocardiography in 25 patients undergoing pacemaker implantation with preserved AV conduction and LV function (Group I), and 15 patients receiving CRT (Group II). In Group I, RAA pacing (AAI mode, n=10) increased P-wave duration (PWD) and RA-to-LA contraction delay (IAMD) compared with sinus rhythm (132±14 and 35±12 ms vs. 108±16 and 13±13 ms, P<0.001). The delayed LA contraction was associated with early interruption of LV filling, leading to an impairment of LV performance (Tei index: 0.43±0.12 vs. 0.34±0.09, P<0.01). BB pacing (AAI, n=15) did not cause such undesirable effects. In Group II, RA (BB)-paced biventricular pacing (DDD) reduced PWD and IAMD compared with RA-sensed biventricular pacing (VDD) (102±14 and -3±13 ms vs. 117±10 and 21±18 ms, P<0.001). This restoration of atrial synchrony was associated with significant improvement of LV performance (Tei index: 0.56±0.18 vs. 0.62±0.16, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: BB pacing preserves atrial synchrony, and might be more favorable than RAA pacing for maximizing hemodynamic efficacy of CRT.
