 OBJECTIVE: To explore mechanism and protective effect of rosiglitazone on myocardial ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury. METHODS: A total of 48 male Japanese white big-ear rabbits were randomly divided into control group (A), I/R group (B), low dose of rosiglitazone group (C), high dose of rosiglitazone group (D). Plasma concentration of and also reduced the concentration of plasma serum creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), ultra-superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), lactic acid glutathione skin peroxidase (GSH-PX), nitric oxide (NO) and endothelin (ET) were measured 1 h later after I/R. Twenty-four hours after I/R the hearts were harvested for pathological and ultrastructural analysis. Area of myocardial infarction were tested. RESULTS: Plasma concentration of CK, CK-MB, hsCRP, NO, MDA and ET were decreased in C, D group compared with group B. Plasma concentration of T-SOD and GSH-Px were increased significantly in C, D group compared with group B. Compared with group B, pathological and ultrastructural changes in C and D group were slightly. There was significant difference in myocardial infarction area between group C, D and group B (P<0.05). Myocardial infarction area and arrhythmia rate were lower in group C, D compare with group B. CONCLUSIONS: Rosiglitazone may protect myocardium from I/R injury by enhancing T-SOD and GSH-Px concentration, inhibit inflammatory reaction, and improve endothelial function.
