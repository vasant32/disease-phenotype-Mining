A 35-year-old man was referred for ablation of ventricular tachycardia with two different morphologies triggering each other. After elimination of the first arrhythmia in the right ventricular outflow tract, ablation of the second morphology was performed 8 mm below the left main stem after contrast injection into the left coronary cusp through the irrigated-tip ablation catheter.
