Myocardial bridging is a common congenital abnormality of a coronary artery, and is usually thought to be a benign anatomical variant. Although rare, previous studies have reported that patients with myocardial bridging may suffer from myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction (MI), arrhythmias and even sudden death. Here we report the case of an 18-year-old adolescent athlete with myocardial bridging resulting in MI. Coronary angiography revealed 80% luminal narrowing by systolic compression in the proximal and mid segments of the left anterior descending coronary artery, which returned to normal during diastole. We considered that heavy sports might be a potential trigger for his MI attack. Therefore, special attention should be paid to this kind of athlete, especially if adolescent.
