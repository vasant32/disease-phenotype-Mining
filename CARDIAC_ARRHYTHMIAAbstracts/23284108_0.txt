 BACKGROUND: the aim of the study was to analyze all-cause mortality and predictors of long-term survival after myocardial revascularization for ischemic cardiomyopathy. METHOD: data of 101 patients (mean age, 63.86 years; age range, 30-85 years; 92% male), operated on with stable coronary artery disease and left ventricular ejection fraction <30% between April 2000 and June 2010, were analyzed. RESULTS: operative mortality was 1.9% (2/101). There was a significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction from 25.99% ± 3.8% preoperatively to 34% ± 12% postoperatively (p <0.0001). The mean duration of follow-up was 56.3 ± 33 months, and it was 97% complete (98/101). There were 18/96 (18.75%) late deaths. Overall actuarial survival at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years was 96%, 89%, 83% and 75%, respectively. Univariate predictors of late death were preoperative arrhythmia, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, and logistic EuroSCORE. Multivariate predictors of late death were cerebrovascular disease and preoperative arrhythmia. CONCLUSION: our study suggests that myocardial revascularization for ischemic cardiomyopathy improves left ventricular ejection fraction and is associated with favorable long-term survival. Patients with cerebrovascular disease and preoperative arrhythmias had poorer outcomes.
