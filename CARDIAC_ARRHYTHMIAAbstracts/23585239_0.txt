BACKGROUND: Vascular complications are a known risk of catheter-based pulmonary vein antral isolation (PVAI). Procedure-related thromboembolic events necessitate full-dose anticoagulation, which worsens outcomes in the event of vascular access injury. OBJECTIVE: Real-time ultrasound allows direct visualization of vascular structures. We hypothesized that ultrasound use with venipuncture reduces vascular complications associated with PVAI. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all adverse events occurring with PVAI was performed during two periods: 2005-2006 when ultrasound was not used and 2008-2010 when ultrasound was routinely employed. All patients received full-dose IV heparin during PVAI. In the no ultrasound cohort, only 14 % underwent PVAI without stopping warfarin, while 91 % of patients in the ultrasound cohort were on continued warfarin. Only patients deemed at high risk for thromboembolism with a periprocedural international normalized ratio (INR) less than 2 were bridged with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin. RESULTS: Ultrasound reduced total vascular complications (1.7 vs. 0.5 %, p < 0.01) and decreased the incidence of major vascular complications by sevenfold. Warfarin with INR ≥ 1.2 on the day of PVAI was associated with more vascular complications (4.3 vs. 1.2 %, p < 0.01). Ultrasound guidance overcame the risk associated with warfarin therapy. Vascular complications in anticoagulated patients with INR ≥ 1.2 using ultrasound guidance were two- and ninefold lower than those in patients not using ultrasound with an INR < 1.2 (0.5 vs. 1.2 %, p < 0.05) and INR ≥ 1.2 (0.5 vs. 4.3 %, p < 0.01), respectively. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided venipuncture improves the safety profile of PVAI, reducing vascular complications in patients on warfarin to levels below those with no ultrasound and off warfarin.
