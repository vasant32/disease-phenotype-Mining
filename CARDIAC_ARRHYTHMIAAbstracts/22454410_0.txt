 AIMS: Right ventricular (RV) pacing has been shown to be potentially detrimental to left ventricular function. In conventional dual-chamber pacing the position of the atrial lead could influence duration of the atrio-ventricular (AV) intervals, which is one of the variables that could be associated with an increased percentage of RV pacing. We wanted to see if lead placement at selected atrial septal sites could reduce AV intervals in patients receiving a dual-chamber pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator. METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a prospective, acute, randomized single centre study that enrolled 57 patients. The atrial lead was placed in both the right atrial appendage (RAA) and the lower atrial septum (LAS) in each patient in random order. The P-wave durations, PR intervals, A sense-V sense (As-Vs), and A pace-V sense (Ap-Vs) intervals were measured at both atrial lead locations in each patient during device implant. The P-wave durations during sinus rhythm (SR), RAA pacing, and LAS pacing were 113 ± 19, 144 ± 27, and 84 ± 12 ms (RAA vs. LAS, P < 0.001), respectively. The PR intervals during SR, RAA pacing, and LAS pacing were 195 ± 47, 230 ± 61, and 167 ± 44 ms (RAA vs. LAS, P < 0.001), respectively. The As-Vs interval was 31% shorter in LAS pacing than in RAA pacing (134 ± 44 ms vs. 194 ± 52 ms, P < 0.001). The Ap-Vs interval was 24% shorter during LAS pacing than during RAA pacing (195 ± 45 ms vs. 257 ± 63 ms, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: When compared with RAA pacing, LAS pacing was associated with a shorter P wave duration, PR interval, As-Vs, and Ap-Vs intervals. The potential long-term impact of the strategy of pacing from LAS in reducing unnecessary RV pacing needs to be explored in future studies.
