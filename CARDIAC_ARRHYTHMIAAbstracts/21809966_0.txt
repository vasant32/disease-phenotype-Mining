Early recurrences of atrial arrhythmias are frequent and have been reported in up to 50% of patients after radiofrequency catheter ablation. As these arrhythmias do not definitively indicate therapy failure over the long term, this period is also referred to as the 'blanking' or 'therapy stabilization' period. Nevertheless, early recurrences have been linked to the occurrence of late recurrences after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation. Treatment strategies aiming at these early recurrences range from conservative management to repeat catheter ablation with controversial results. In this article, we evaluate a recent publication investigating the efficacy of an aggressive rhythm control approach, with the use of prompt electrical cardioversion for early arrhythmia recurrences on long-term outcomes after atrial fibrillation ablation, and discuss the results in the light of current evidence.
