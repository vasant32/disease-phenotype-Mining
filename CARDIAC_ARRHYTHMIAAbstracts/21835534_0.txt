Premature ventricular contractions originating in the right ventricular outflow tract may respond poorly to pharmacological treatment, and ablation using conventional fluoroscopically-guided systems may be complicated by the difficulty in inducing arrhythmias. We describe the use of a non-contact mapping system to ablate difficult-to-induce premature ventricular contractions originating in the right ventricular outflow tract. Five premature ventricular contractions sites in the right ventricular outflow tract were ablated in a prospective series of 4 patients. Patients had a poor quality of life and had not responded to antiarrhythmic drugs. A mean of 3 radiofrequency pulses per site was applied and mean application time was 113±15s. We achieved a 100% acute success rate and there were no complications. Patients were asymptomatic without drug therapy after a mean of 30±16 months of follow-up. The noncontact mapping system is highly effective in eliminating difficult to induce, isolated premature ventricular contractions.
