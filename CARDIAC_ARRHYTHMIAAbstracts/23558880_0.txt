Flecainide is a class 1C antiarrhythmic drug especially used for the management of supraventricular arrhythmia. In overdose cases, flecainide can induce life treating ventricular arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock. We report the case of a 72-year-old woman admitted to our intensive care unit for a regular monomorphic wide complex tachycardia (QRS duration 240 ms, right bundle branch block and superior axis morphology) without apparent P waves. Clinical examination showed slight left congestive heart failure signs without cardiogenic shock. An intravenous bolus of 10 mg adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) was ineffective to stop the tachycardia. The diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia induced by flecainide overdose was considered. 500 mL of intravenous 84â€° sodium bicarbonate was administrated. The patient's QRS narrowed immediately and 12-lead ECG showed sinus rhythm. Blood samples confirmed the flecainide overdose and the clinical status progressively improved.
