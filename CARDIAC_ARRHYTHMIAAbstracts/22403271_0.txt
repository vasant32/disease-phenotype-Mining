 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sudden death is common in hemodialysis patients, but whether modifiable practices affect the risk of sudden death remains unclear. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This study analyzed 37,765 participants in 12 countries in the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study to explore the association of the following practices with sudden death (due to cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, and/or hyperkalemia): treatment time [TT] <210 minutes, Kt/V <1.2, ultrafiltration volume >5.7% of postdialysis weight, low dialysate potassium [K(D) <3]), and prescription of Q wave/T wave interval-prolonging drugs. Cox regression was used to estimate effects on mortality, adjusting for potential confounders. An instrumental variable approach was used to further control for unmeasured patient-level confounding. RESULTS: There were 9046 deaths, 26% of which were sudden (crude mortality rate, 15.3/100 patient-years; median follow-up, 1.59 years). Associations with sudden death included hazard ratios of 1.13 for short TT, 1.15 for large ultrafiltration volume, and 1.10 for low Kt/V. Compared with K(D) ≥3 mEq/L, the sudden death rate was higher for K(D) ≤1.5 and K(D)=2-2.5 mEq/L. The instrumental variable approach yielded generally consistent findings. The sudden death rate was elevated for patients taking amiodarone, but not other Q wave/T wave interval-prolonging drugs. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified modifiable dialysis practices associated with higher risk of sudden death, including short TT, large ultrafiltration volume, and low K(D). Because K(D) <3 mEq/L is common and easy to change, K(D) tailoring may prevent some sudden deaths. This hypothesis merits testing in clinical trials.
