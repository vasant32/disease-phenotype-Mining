Ventricular arrhythmias account for high mortality in cardiopulmonary patients in Intensive Care Units. Cardiovascular alterations and molecular level changes in response to the commonly used oxygen treatment remains unknown. In the present study we investigated cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac complications in mice subjected to hyperoxia. Results demonstrate that there is a significant increase in average heart weight to tibia length (22%) in mice subjected to hyperoxia treatment vs normoxia. Functional assessment was performed in mice subjected to hyperoxic treatment and results demonstrate impaired cardiac function with decreased cardiac output and heart rate. Staining of transverse cardiac sections clearly demonstrate increase in the cross sectional area from hyperoxic hearts compared to control hearts. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis indicated differential mRNA and protein expression levels between hyperoxia treated and control left ventricles for ion channels including Kv4.2 (-2±0.08), Kv2.1 (2.54±0.48), and Scn5a (1.4±0.07); chaperon KChIP2 (-1.7±0.06); transcriptional factors such as, GATA4 (-1.5±0.05), Irx5 (5.6±1.74), NFκB1 (4.17±0.43); hypertrophy markers including MHC-6 (2.17±0.36) and MHC-7 (4.62±0.76); gap junction protein Gja1 (4.4±0.8); and microRNA processing enzyme Drosha (4.6±0.58). Taken together, the data presented here clearly indicate that hyperoxia induces left ventricular remodeling and hypertrophy and alters the expression of Kv4.2 and MHC6/7 in the heart.
