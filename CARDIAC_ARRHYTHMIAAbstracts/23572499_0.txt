BACKGROUND: This study examined the impact of different ablation strategies on AF recurrence and quality of life (QoL) in coexistent atrial fibrillation (AF) and flutter (AFL). METHODS AND RESULTS: Three-hundred sixty enrolled patients with documented AF and AFL were blinded and randomized to group 1: AF±AFL ablation (n=182) or Group 2: AFL ablation only (n=178). AF-recurrence was evaluated with event-recording and 7-day Holter at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months follow-up. QoL was assessed at baseline and 12-month follow-up using 4 questionnaires; Medical Outcome Study Short Form, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score, Beck Depression Inventory and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Of the 182 patients in group 1, 58 (63±8 years, 78% male, 59±8% LVEF) had AF+AFL ablation and 124 (61±11 years, 72% male, 59±7% LVEF) had AF ablation only. In group 2 (62±9 years, 76% male, 58±10% LVEF) only flutter was ablated by achieving bidirectional isthmus conduction block. Baseline characteristics were not different across groups. At 21±9 months follow-up, 125 (69%) in group 1 and 34 (19%) in group 2 were arrhythmia-free (p <0.001). In group 1, scores on most QoL subscales showed significant improvement at follow-up, whereas group 2 patients derived relatively minor benefit. CONCLUSIONS: In coexistent AF and AFL, lower recurrence rate and better QoL is associated with AF ablation only or AF +AFL ablation, than with lone AFL ablation. Furthermore, QoL directly correlates with freedom from arrhythmia as shown in this study for the first time, in patients blinded to the procedure.
