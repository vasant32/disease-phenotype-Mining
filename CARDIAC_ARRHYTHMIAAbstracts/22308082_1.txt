 AIMS: To investigate the relationship between electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters [J wave, fragmented QRS (fQRS), QTc, the peak-to-end interval of T wave (Tp-Te)], and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in chronic heart failure (CHF). METHODS AND RESULTS: The ECGs of 1570 CHF patients, 572 cases with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and 998 cases with ischaemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) were analysed with the endpoint being an SCD or non-SCD (NSCD). During a median follow-up period of 36 months (0.40-65 months), 438 (27.89%) patients died, of which 158 (35.84%) were SCD. Overall, the occurrence of J wave, fQRS, and long Tp-Te were greater in SCD patients than that of NSCD patients (all P< 0.01). For DCM cases, more SCD patients had J waves observed in the inferior leads than that in the NSCD group (26.78 vs. 13.07%, P<0.001). However, ICM cases with SCD did have more fQRS in the inferior leads than that with NSCD (42.16 vs. 26.67%, P= 0.01). After adjusting for other risk factors, Cox regression analysis revealed that presence of J wave or fQRS in the inferior leads predicted a higher risk for SCD in DCM [hazard ratio (HR), 4.095; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.132-7.863] and ICM (HR, 2.714; 95% CI, 1.809-4.072) patients. A left ventricular ejection fraction â‰¤ 30% also predicted SCD and NSCD in DCM and ICM patients. In contrast, the predictive value of QTc and Tp-Te for SCD was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of J wave or fQRS in the inferior leads predicted higher risk of SCD in DCM and ICM patients and might serve as independent predictors for SCD in patients with CHF.
