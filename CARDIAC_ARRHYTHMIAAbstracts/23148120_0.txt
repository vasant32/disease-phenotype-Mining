AIMS: Orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (ORT) is the most common arrhythmia at electrophysiological study (EPS) in patients with pre-excitation. The purpose of the study was to determine the clinical significance and the electrophysiological characteristics of patients with inducible antidromic tachycardia (ADT).METHODS AND RESULTS: Electrophysiological study was performed in 807 patients with a pre-excitation syndrome in control state and after isoproterenol. Antidromic tachycardia was induced in 63 patients (8%). Clinical and electrophysiological data were compared with those of 744 patients without ADT. Patients with and without ADT were similar in term of age (33 ± 18 vs. 34 ± 17), male gender (68 vs. 61%), clinical presentation with spontaneous atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) (35 vs. 42%), atrial fibrillation (AF) (3 vs. 3%), syncope (16 vs. 12%). In patients with induced ADT, asymptomatic patients were less frequent (24 vs. 37%; <0.04), spontaneous ADT and spontaneous malignant form more frequent (8 vs. 0.5%; <0.001) (16 vs. 6%; <0.002). Left lateral accessory pathway (AP) location was more frequent (51 vs. 36%; P < 0.022), septal location less frequent (40 vs. 56%; P < 0.01). And 1/1 conduction through AP was more rapid. Orthodromic AVRT induction was as frequent (55.5 vs. 55%), but AF induction (41 vs. 24%; P < 0.002) and electrophysiological malignant form were more frequent (22 vs. 12%; P < 0.02). The follow-up was similar; four deaths and three spontaneous malignant forms occurred in patients without ADT. When population was divided based on age (<20/≥20 years), the older group was less likely to have criteria for malignant form.CONCLUSION: Antidromic tachycardia induction is rare in pre-excitation syndrome and generally is associated with spontaneous or electrophysiological malignant form, but clinical outcome does not differ.
