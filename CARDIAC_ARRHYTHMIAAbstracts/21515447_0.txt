 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of fluvastatin on lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-induced ventricular arrhythmias and its mechanism. METHODS: Twenty male SD rats were randomly allocated into two equal groups, namely LPC treatment group and fluvastatin pretreatment group. Langendorff apparatus was used for cardiac perfusion ex vivo with 5 µmol/L LPC for 5 min followed by washing for 30 min in LPC treatment group, and in fluvastatin pretreatment group, a 30-min perfusion with 10 µmol/L fluvastatin was administered before LPC perfusion. The LPC-induced nonselective cation current (I(NSC)) in the ventricular myocytes was recorded using the whole-cell voltage-clamp method. RESULTS: Fluvastatin significantly inhibited LPC-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmia/fibrillation and I(NSC). The small G-protein Rho inhibitor (C3) and Rho-kinase inhibitor (Y-27632) in the pipette solution also suppressed LPC-induced I(NSC). CONCLUSION: Fluvastatin offers cardiac protection against LPC by inhibiting LPC-induced I(NSC). LPC induces fatal arrhythmia via a Rho/Rho-kinase-mediated pathway.
