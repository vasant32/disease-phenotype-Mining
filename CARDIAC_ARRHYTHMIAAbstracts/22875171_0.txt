Myocardial fibrosis (MF) is a common pathophysiologic endpoint in non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and may be identified by Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) MRI. While associated with future cardiovascular events in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) and Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) the influence of MF on interim quality of life (QOL) has not been explored. In this study we investigate for associations between MF and validated indices of QOL in patients with HCM and DCM. Ninety-eight patients with known cardiomyopathy (n = 56-HCM/n = 42-DCM) underwent LGE-MRI in addition to standardized testing for QOL using the disease-specific Minnesota Living With Heart Failure (MLWHF) and the generic SF-12 questionnaires. LGE-MRI images were blindly analyzed for the presence and volume of MF using validated techniques. All analyses were stratified according to cardiomyopathy sub-type. The mean age of the population was 56.8 Â± 12.9 years. MF was identified in 82 % of patients with HCM and 74 % of patients with DCM with respective mean MF burdens of 20.0 and 13.7 % of the left ventricular mass (p = 0.008). QOL scores for those with HCM or DCM, as assessed by both MLWHF and SF-12, were not significantly different between those with versus those without MF, and showed no association with MF burden by quantitative signal analysis. In this study we identified no association between QOL and MF burden by LGE-MRI in patients with HCM or DCM. Therefore, the severity of underlying myocardial tissue disease, a recognized substrate for ventricular arrhythmia, cannot and should not be inferred from the patient's symptom status or QOL.
