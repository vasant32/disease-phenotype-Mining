 BACKGROUND: Inducibility of atrial fibrillation (AF) after pulmonary vein isolation has been used to guide additional left atrial ablation in paroxysmal AF. The sensitivity and specificity of AF induction in this setting remains uncertain. We examined the incidence and characteristics of inducible AF in patients without structural heart disease or clinical AF and the effect of different induction protocols on AF inducibility. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 44 patients with supraventricular tachycardia with no history of AF or risk factors for AF, atrial refractoriness and conduction were measured, followed by AF induction attempts (10/patient). Each induction was performed after a waiting time that exceeded twice the duration of induced AF from the preceding induction. AF≥1 minute was considered inducible, and ≥5 minutes as sustained. Burst pacing (at 200 ms for 10 seconds) was compared to decremental pacing (from 200 ms to shortest cycle length, resulting in 1:1 atrial capture for 10 seconds). After 10 inductions, AF was inducible in 49.5%, and sustained in 29.5% of patients. The incidence of both inducible and sustained AF increased with each induction. Apart from male gender, no clinical or electrophysiological features were associated with sustained AF. Decremental pacing was associated with a higher incidence of sustained AF (41.2% versus 14.8%, P=0.049), longer duration of AF (P=0.006), and shorter mean AF cycle length (P<0.001) compared with burst pacing. CONCLUSIONS: Inducible and sustained AF is common in patients in the absence of structural heart disease or clinical AF, and its incidence varies according to gender, method of induction, and number of inductions. There is a direct relationship between AF persistence and number of inductions, which has not reached a plateau after 10 inductions.
