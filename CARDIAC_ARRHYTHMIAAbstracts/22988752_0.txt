It has been well established that opioid peptides (OPs) affect various hormonal systems. Opioids exhibit stress-limiting and gastro-protective effects in stressed animals, acting via mu- and delta-opioid receptors (OR). Peripheral mu-OR stimulation by endogenous and exogenous opioids increases cardiac tolerance to pathological consequences of stress. Enhancement ofprostacyclin synthesis, decrease of thromboxane production as well as suppression of lipid peroxidation can be directly responsible for cardioprotective effects of OPs in stressed animals. Adaptive responses are accompanied by increased OP levels in blood and tissues. Reduction of ventricular arrhythmias induced by repeated short-term immobilization stress is mediated via mu-OR stimulation by endogenous opioids, while delta-OR account for an antiarrhythmic effect of adaptation to chronic intermittent hypobaric hypoxia. The mechanism of infarct size-limiting effect of continuous normobaric hypoxia involves both mu- and delta-OR stimulation. Peptide OR agonists can be considered in future clinical practice for treatment of withdrawal syndrome, stress-related cardiac disease or myocardial injury caused by ischemia-reperfusion insult.
