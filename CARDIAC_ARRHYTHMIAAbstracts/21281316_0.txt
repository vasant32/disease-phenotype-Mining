A 62-year-old woman who underwent heart transplantation 6 years later presented a regular atrial tachycardia. Electrophysiologic evaluation showed an atrial arrhythmia in the recipient atrium with 2:1 conduction to the donor atrium, with a confusing electroanatomical map. With the suspect of alternant conduction through two different breakthroughs, the map was split in two concordant maps, corresponding to two connections that were successfully ablated. Later on, a third connection was detected and therefore ablated.
