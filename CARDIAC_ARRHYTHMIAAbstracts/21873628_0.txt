Cardiac magnetic resonance demonstrated myocardial damage within the left ventricle (LV) in a patient with cardiac sarcoidosis. During inflammation, ST-segment elevation was observed in her ECG. The ST-segment deviation was attenuated following disappearance of the abnormal Gallium-67 uptake in the LV, suggesting transmural LV voltage gradient was a cause of the ST-segment elevation.
