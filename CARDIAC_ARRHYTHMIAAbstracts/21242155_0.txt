Laceration of pacemaker leads as a late complication after clavicular osteosynthesis is rare; however, the consequences can be fatal. We present the case of a 61-year-old gentleman with a history of right clavicular osteosynthesis using a compression plate, who 20 years later received a right pectoral dual-chamber pacemaker. Twenty months after pacemaker implantation, a screw tip migration from the osteosynthesis caused laceration and dysfunction of the atrial lead. The osteosynthesis material was completely removed and atrial lead replaced. This case demonstrates that pacemaker systems in these rare patients should be placed on the contralateral side.
