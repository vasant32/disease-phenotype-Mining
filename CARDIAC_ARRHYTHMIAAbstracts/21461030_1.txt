Sudden cardiac death from ventricular fibrillation during myocardial infarction is a leading cause of total and cardiovascular mortality. This multifactorial, complex condition clusters in families, suggesting a substantial genetic cause. We carried out a genomewide association study (GWAS) for sudden cardiac death, in the AGNES (Arrhythmia Genetics in the Netherlands) population, consisting of patients with (cases) and without (controls) ventricular fibrillation during a first ST-elevation myocardial infarction. The most significant association was found at chromosome 21q21 (rs2824292; odds ratio = 1.78, 95% CI 1.47-2.13, P = 3.3 × 10(-10)), 98 kb proximal of the CXADR gene, encoding the Coxsackie and adenovirus receptor. This locus has not previously been implicated in arrhythmia susceptibility. Further research on the mechanism of this locus will ultimately provide novel insight into arrhythmia mechanisms in this condition.
