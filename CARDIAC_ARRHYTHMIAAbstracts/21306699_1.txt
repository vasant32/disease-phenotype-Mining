An 82-year-old woman was admitted with feculent vaginal discharge and bleeding per vagina. Investigations revealed the presence of a rectovaginal fistula with no obvious etiology. Due to the surgical team's previous experience with nicorandil-induced ulceration, the drug was stopped. The rectovaginal fistula healed completely within 6 months.
