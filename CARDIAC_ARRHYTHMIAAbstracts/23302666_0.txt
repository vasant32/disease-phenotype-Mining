 OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of transcatheter closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defects (pmVSD) with aneurysmatic formation and muscular ventricular septal defects (mVSD) with Amplatzer duct occluder II. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 48 cases received transcatheter closure of pmVSD aneurysmatic formation or mVSD from February 2011 to March 2012 in our hospital (42 pmVSD with aneurysmatic formation and 6 mVSD). Median age was 5.2 years (range: 1.8 - 15 years), and median weight was 20.2 kg (range: 12 - 44 kg). Amplatzer duct occluder II was selected depending on the condition of ventricular septal defect. The device was implanted by antegrade or retrograde approach. Complications such as residual shunt, valvular regurgitation and arrhythmia were evaluated by echocardiography or angiography. Median follow-up was 9.5 months (range: 1 - 13 months). RESULTS: The mean ratio of pulmonary (Qp) to systemic (Qs) blood flow was 1.35 ± 0.15 before transcatheter closure. The diameter of exit hole of ventricular septal defects was (2.46 ± 0.53) mm measured by transthoracic echocardiography, and (2.35 ± 0.40) mm by angiography. Successful implantation of the device was achieved in 46 patients (96%) and unsuccessful in two cases due to acute aortic insufficiency. Forty-two (92%) patients were closed successfully, and trivial residual leak was evidenced in four patients and remained unchanged during follow-up. One patient with mVSD still had trivial residual shunt at 6 months post procedure. New trivial tricuspid insufficiency was observed in 1 patient (2.1%) during follow-up. Two patients developed procedural related left anterior fascicular block and remained unchanged during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: pmVSD with aneurysm and mVSD could be successfully treated with Amplatzer duct occluder II. However, the long waist and large disc of the device could interfere with tricuspid valve function and cause tricuspid insufficiency.
