Distribution of p-tyrosol in organism was studied in rats after a single intravenous administration in a dose of 200 mg/kg. It was shown that p-tyrosol rapidly penetrates into well perfused organs (brain, heart, kidneys). The maximum concentration ofp-tyrosol in these organs was determined in 1 minute after administration, and the mean distribution constant was within 0.8-1.11. The albumin bound fraction ofp-tyrozol amounted to 0.26-0.30.
