 AIMS: The prerequisite for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is ventricular capture, which may be verified by analysis of the surface electrocardiogram (ECG). Few algorithms exist to diagnose loss of ventricular capture. METHODS AND RESULTS: Electrocardiograms from 126 CRT patients were analysed during biventricular (BV), right ventricular (RV), and left ventricular (LV) pacing. An algorithm evaluating QRS narrowing in the limb leads and increasing negativity in lead I to diagnose changes in ventricular capture was devised, prospectively validated, and compared with two existing algorithms. Performance of the algorithm according to ventricular lead position was also assessed. RESULTS: Our algorithm had an accuracy of 88% to correctly identify the changes in ventricular capture (either loss or gain of RV or LV capture). The algorithm had a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 96% with an accuracy of 96% for identifying loss of LV capture (the most clinically relevant change), and compared favourably with the existing algorithms. Performance of the algorithms was not significantly affected by RV or LV lead position. CONCLUSION: A simple two-step algorithm evaluating QRS width in the limb leads and changes in negativity in lead I can accurately diagnose the lead responsible for intermittent loss of ventricular capture in CRT. This simple tool may be of particular use outside the setting of specialized device clinics.
