Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood is a self-limited anemia occurring in previously healthy children, secondary to temporary cessation of erythrocyte production. Although the precise etiology is unclear, most cases are associated with a viral illness. The anemia may be severe, with associated pallor, tachypnea, and tachycardia; treatment is supportive. We present an unusual case of a child with viral-induced transient erythroblastopenia of childhood and associated ectopic atrial tachycardia, requiring therapy with antiarrhythmics.
