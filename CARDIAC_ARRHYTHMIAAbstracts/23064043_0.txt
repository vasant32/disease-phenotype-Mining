 BACKGROUND: Catheter ablation is an effective treatment for medically refractory, disabling atrial fibrillation (AF). Ablation success may be limited in patients with persistent or long-standing persistent AF. A pericardioscopic, hybrid epicardial-endocardial technique for AF ablation may be a preferred approach for such patients. Limited data are available using such an approach. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate 1-year outcomes of a hybrid technique for AF ablation. METHODS: A cohort of 101 patients underwent AF ablation using a transdiaphragmatic pericardioscopic, hybrid epicardial-endocardial technique. Patients were followed with 24-hour Holter monitors at 3-, 6-, and 12-month intervals. Symptom severity was assessed at baseline and follow-up by using the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Severity of Atrial Fibrillation scale. RESULTS: Mean AF duration was 5.9 years; 47% were persistent and 37% were long-standing persistent. Mean left atrial size was 5.1 cm (range 3.3-7 cm). Overall, 12-month arrhythmia-free survival was 66.3% after a single ablation procedure and 70.5% including repeat ablation. Repeat ablation was required in 6% of the patients and antiarrhythmic drug therapy in 37% of the patients. Quality of life improved significantly and was durable over 12-month follow-up. There were 2 deaths, which occurred in the early postoperative period: one due to atrioesophageal fistula and the second due to sudden cardiac death without apparent cause by autopsy. CONCLUSIONS: We report the largest series to date of a hybrid epicardial-endocardial, stand-alone ablation procedure using a pericardioscopic technique for the treatment of AF. While respecting the identified complications, our results demonstrate a high potential for successful treatment in a challenging patient population with AF.
