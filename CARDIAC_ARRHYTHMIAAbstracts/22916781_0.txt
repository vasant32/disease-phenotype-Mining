Cardiac herniation is a rare event associated with a high mortality rate. It is typically seen with blunt trauma to the chest or after a pneumectomy. Signs and symptoms include arrhythmia, myocardial ischemia, and hypotension. Diagnostic modalities, such as computed tomography scan, chest roentgenogram, magnetic resonance imaging, and transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, are key to diagnosis. Successful management requires timely recognition along with prompt surgical intervention.
