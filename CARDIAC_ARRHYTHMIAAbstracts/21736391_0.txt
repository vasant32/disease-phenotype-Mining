Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia affecting approximately 2.2 million Americans. Because several studies have suggested that changes in mitochondrial function and morphology may contribute to AF, we developed a novel proteomic workflow focused on the identification of differentially expressed mitochondrial proteins in AF patients. Right human atrial tissue was collected from 20 patients, 10 with and 10 without AF, and the tissue was subjected to hydrostatic pressure cycling-based lysis followed by label-free mass spectrometric (MS) analysis of mitochondrial enriched isolates. Approximately 5% of the 700 proteins identified by MS analysis were differentially expressed between the AF and non-AF samples. We chose four differentially abundant proteins for further verification using reverse phase protein microarray analysis based on their known importance in energy production and regulatory association with atrial ion channels: four and a half LIM, destrin, heat shock protein 2, and chaperonin-containing TCP1. These initial study results provide evidence that a workflow to identify AF-related proteins that combines a powerful upfront tissue cell lysis with high resolution MS for discovery and protein array technology for verification may be an effective strategy for discovering candidate markers in highly fibrous tissue samples.
