 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between age-related decline in flecainide clearance and CYP2D6 genotype, we conducted a population pharmacokinetic analysis of flecainide using routine therapeutic drug monitoring data. METHODS: Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed on retrospective data from 163 genotyped patients treated with oral flecainide for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. The CYP2D6 genotype was categorized as CYP2D6 homozygous extensive metabolizers (hom-EMs; n=57), heterozygous extensive metabolizers (het-EMs; n=79), and intermediate metabolizers and poor metabolizers (IMs/PMs; n=27). RESULTS: Population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that estimated glomerular filtration rate, body weight, female sex, and aging were important factors for estimating flecainide clearance. The metabolic clearance was decreased age dependently in a curvilinear fashion, where the lower clearance was observed in greater than 60 years for het-EMs and greater than 55 years for IMs/PMs. The reduction in metabolic clearance in elderly (70 years) patients compared with middle-aged (52 years) patients was different among the CYP2D6 genotype groups: 22.1 and 49.5% in CYP2D6 het-EMs and IMs/PMs, respectively, and no change in hom-EMs. A 11.4% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate in elderly patients compared with middle-aged patients corresponded to 6.1% decline in flecainide clearance. Overall, the age-related decline in flecainide clearance was 6.1% in hom-EMs, 16.3% in het-EMs, and 28.9% in IMs/PMs groups. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that CYP2D6 genotype is a determinant factor of age-related decline in flecainide clearance.
