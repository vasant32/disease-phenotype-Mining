Coronary artery anomalies were found in 24(0.6%) patients undergoing coronary arteriography at University Cardiac Center, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka from 2004 to 2007. Of the 24 patient, 21(87.5%) had anomalies of origin and distribution and 3(12.5%) had coronary artery fistulae. Most coronary anomalies did not result in signs, symptoms or complications and usually were discovered as an incidental finding at the time of catheterization. Most of them were benign anomalies: i) separate origin of left anterior descending and circumflex from sinus of valsalva; ii) ectopic origin of circumflex from right sinus of valsalva; iii) Anomalous origin of left main coronary artery from right coronary artery; iv) anomalous coronary origin from ascending aorta; v) absent left circumflex; vi) double right coronary artery; vii) small coronary artery fistula. These anomalies may be associated with potentially serious sequelae such as angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, syncope, cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or sudden death. In this study large coronary artery fistula was found as potentially serious anomaly. So coronary artery anomalies require accurate recognition for the appropriate management of the patients.
