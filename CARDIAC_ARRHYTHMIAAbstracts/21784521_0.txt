To investigate the effect of inhibition of Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isoform1 (NHE1) on K562 leukemia-driven angiogenesis, the selective NHE1 inhibitor cariporide was used. Cariporide treatment of K562 resulted in a decrease in pHi and down-regulation of VEGF secretion. The proliferation, migration and in vitro tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells was decreased in cariporide treated K562 condition medium (CM) while VEGF supplement could partially restore the inhibitory effect. Subcutaneous injection of nude mice with cariporide inhibited K562 tumor growth with a reduction of the density of microvessels compared to the control group.
