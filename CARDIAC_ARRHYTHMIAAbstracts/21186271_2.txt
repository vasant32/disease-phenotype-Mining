We sought to explore the distribution pattern of Na(+) channels across ventricular wall, and to determine its functional correlates, in the guinea pig heart. Voltage-dependent Na(+) channel (Na(v)) protein expression levels were measured in transmural samples of ventricular tissue by Western blotting. Isolated, perfused heart preparations were used to record monophasic action potentials and volume-conducted ECG, and to measure effective refractory periods (ERPs) and pacing thresholds, in order to assess excitability, electrical restitution kinetics, and susceptibility to stimulation-evoked tachyarrhythmias at epicardial and endocardial stimulation sites. In both ventricular chambers, Na(v) protein expression was higher at endocardium than epicardium, with midmyocardial layers showing intermediate expression levels. Endocardial stimulation sites showed higher excitability, as evidenced by lower pacing thresholds during regular stimulation and downward displacement of the strength-interval curve reconstructed after extrasystolic stimulation compared with epicardium. ERP restitution assessed over a wide range of pacing rates showed greater maximal slope and faster kinetics at endocardial than epicardial stimulation sites. Flecainide, a Na(+) channel blocker, reduced the maximal ERP restitution slope, slowed restitution kinetics, and eliminated epicardial-to-endocardial difference in dynamics of electrical restitution. Greater excitability and steeper electrical restitution have been associated with greater arrhythmic susceptibility of endocardium than epicardium, as assessed by measuring ventricular fibrillation threshold, inducibility of tachyarrhythmias by rapid cardiac pacing, and the magnitude of stimulation-evoked repolarization alternans. In conclusion, higher Na(+) channel expression levels may contribute to greater excitability, steeper electrical restitution slopes and faster restitution kinetics, and greater susceptibility to stimulation-evoked tachyarrhythmias at endocardium than epicardium in the guinea pig heart.
