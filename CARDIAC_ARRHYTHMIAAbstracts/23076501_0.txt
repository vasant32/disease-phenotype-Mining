The generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from human somatic cells bears the possibility to generate patient-specific stem cell lines which can serve as a theoretically unlimited source of somatic cells carrying the genotype of the patients. Different types of the long-QT syndrome have been studied by analyzing the phenotype of cardiomyocytes generated from patient-specific iPSC lines. Major aspects of the pathophysiology of long-QT syndrome, like prolonged action potentials, arrhythmia, and the effects of pro- and antiarrhythmic drugs could be recapitulated in these cells. In the future, patient-specific iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes might be used to screen for new drugs, to avoid unwanted drug side effects, and to deepen our understanding on the pathophysiology of long-QT syndromes.
