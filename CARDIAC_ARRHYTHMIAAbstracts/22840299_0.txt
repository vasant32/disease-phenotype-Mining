The results of the Endovascular Valve Edge-to-Edge Repair Study (EVEREST) II trial have demonstrated that percutaneous mitral valve repair using the MitraClip in high-risk patients was associated favourable outcomes. However, commonly accepted contraindications for the standard MitraClip procedure include extensively prolapsed valves and flail leaflets. We report on the management of a patient not amenable to standard interventional procedure.
