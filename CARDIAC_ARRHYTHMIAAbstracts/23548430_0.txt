Thomboembolism is the most threatening complication in patients with atrial fibrillation. Main source of embolism is the left atrial thrombosis. Mechanisms of development of thromboembolic complications in patients with arrhythmias are far from being deciphered. In this review we discuss possible mechanisms of formation of intracardiac thrombus - abnormalities of functioning of the hemostasis system, endothelial dysfunction, inflammatory reactions, fibrosis of the left atrial wall, genetic traits.
