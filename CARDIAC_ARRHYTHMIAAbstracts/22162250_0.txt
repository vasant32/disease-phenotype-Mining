We describe a patient with severe aortic stenosis who underwent CoreValve (Medtronic) implantation and presented several days later with a tachyarrhythmic episode. The electrocardiographic features of the arrhythmia were compatible with left-ventricular outflow tract ventricular-tachycardia. The life-threatening event was not associated with ischemia or an electrolyte disorder and was not drug-induced. A probable cause was the irritation of the myocardium by the prosthetic valve. Clinicians should be aware that the presence of anatomical parameters that increases the risk for myocardial injury and the need for pacemaker implantation might indicate an increased risk of a tachyarrhythmic episode.
