We report the case of a male patient who had undergone successful cardiac surgery about 20 years previously for a posteroseptal accessory pathway that caused almost incessant orthodromic AV reentrant tachycardia, but presented again recently with new onset cardiac arrhythmia. 3D mapping demonstrated scar-related reentrant tachycardia in the right atrium with a critical isthmus between the atriotomy scar and terminal crest, which could be successfully treated using irrigated-tip high-frequency catheter ablation.
