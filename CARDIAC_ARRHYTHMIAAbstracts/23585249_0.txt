AIMS: The aim of this study is to develop a new feature for automatic biventricular capture verification in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices, by means of morphological analysis of the intracardiac electrogram (IEGM).METHODS AND RESULTS: The algorithm performs capture classification based on a novel adaptive signed correlation index (ASCI), which measures morphological similarity between the post-pace IEGM and a template waveform representing captured paces. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, CRT pacemakers were implanted in six dogs. During a mean follow-up of 23 days, 175 biventricular threshold tests were conducted with various configurations of pace/sense polarities. Biventricular IEGMs were recorded and downloaded for offline analysis. Template signals for each pace/sense configuration in each chamber were created for individual dogs during the first follow-up. Each pace was annotated for capture or non-capture by visual examination of the IEGM. A total of 9991 capture paces and 4474 non-capture paces were included for morphological analysis. The calculated ASCI values were well separated for capture and non-capture paces irrespective of right/left pacing chambers, pace/sense configurations, pacing amplitude, individual dogs, and temporal proximity of the capture templates. Overall, the classification accuracy of the algorithm remained â‰¥99% for any ASCI cut-off value choosing between 0.18 and 0.52.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the feasibility to perform automatic biventricular capture verification based on morphological analysis of the IEGM.
