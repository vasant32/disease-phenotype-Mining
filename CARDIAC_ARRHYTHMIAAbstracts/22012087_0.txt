Cardiac arrhythmia relating to hypoglycemia is suggested as a cause of death in diabetic patients. This article introduces electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters for artificially induced hypoglycemia detection. In addition, a hybrid technique of swarm-based support vector machine (SVM) is introduced for hypoglycemia detection using the ECG parameters as inputs. In this technique, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to optimize the SVM to detect hypoglycemia. In an experiment using medical data of patients with Type 1 diabetes, the introduced ECG parameters show significant contributions to the performance of the hypoglycemia detection and the proposed detection technique performs well in terms of sensitivity and specificity.
