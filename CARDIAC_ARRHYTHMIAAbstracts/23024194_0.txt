Lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum (LHIS) is a benign cardiac mass characterized by fat accumulation in the interatrial septum. It may represent an incidental autopsy finding or may be associated with atrial arrhythmias, obstructive symptoms or sudden death. The case described here is a peculiar case of sudden death secondary to LHIS.
