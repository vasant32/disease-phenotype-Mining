OBJECTIVES: To determine the availability of quinidine in the world. BACKGROUND: Quinidine is the only oral medication that is effective for preventing life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias due to Brugada syndrome and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. However, because of its low price and restricted indication, this medication is not marketed in many countries. METHODS: We conducted a world survey of quinidine availability by contacting professional medical societies and arrhythmia specialists worldwide. Physicians were e-mailed questionnaires requesting information concerning the quinidine preparation available at their hospital. We also requested information concerning cases of adverse arrhythmic events resulting from quinidine unavailability. RESULTS: A total of 273 physicians from 131 countries provided information regarding quinidine availability: Quinidine is readily available in only 19 (14%) countries. In contrast, this medication is not accessible in 99 (76%) countries and is available but only through specific regulatory processes that require 4-30 days for completion in 13 (10%) countries. We were able to gather information concerning 22 patients who had serious arrhythmias probably related (10 cases) or possibility related (12 cases) to the absence of quinidine, including 2 fatalities possibly due to quinidine unavailability. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of quinidine accessibility is a serious medical hazard at the global level.
