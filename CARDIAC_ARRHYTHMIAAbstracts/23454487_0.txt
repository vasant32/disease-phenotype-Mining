BACKGROUND: The mechanisms by which acute left atrial ischemia (LAI) leads to AF initiation and perpetuation remain unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: LAI (90-minute ischemia) was obtained in isolated sheep hearts by selectively perfusing microspheres into the left anterior atrial artery. Two CCD cameras and several bipolar electrodes enabled recording from multiple atrial locations: with a dual-camera set-up (Protocol 1, n=10; and 1', n=4; for bi-atrial or atrio-ventricular camera set-ups respectively), in the presence of propranolol/atropine (1µM) added to the perfusate after LAI (protocol 2, n=3) and after a pre-treatment with glibenclamide 10 µM (protocol 3, n=4). Spontaneous AF occurred in 41.2% (7/17) of the hearts that were in sinus rhythm before LAI. LAI caused APD shortening in both the ischemic (IZ) and non-ischemic (NIZ) zones by 21±8 and 34±13%, respectively (pacing, 5Hz, p<0.05 compared to baseline). Apparent impulse velocity was significantly reduced in the IZ but not in the NIZ (-65±19% and +9±18%, p=0.001 and n.s, respectively). During LAI-related AF, a significant NIZ maximal dominant frequency (DFmax) increase from 7.4±2.5 to 14.0±5.5 Hz; p<0.05, was observed. Glibenclamide, an IKATP channel blocker, averted LAI-related DFmax increase (NIZ: LAI vs Gli, 14.0±5.5 vs. 5.9±1.3 Hz, p<0.05). Interplay between spontaneous focal discharges and rotors, locating at the IZ-NIZ border zone, maintained LAI-related AF. CONCLUSIONS: LAI leads to an IKATP conductance-dependent APD shortening and spontaneous AF maintained by both spontaneous focal discharges and reentrant circuits locating at the IZ border zone.
