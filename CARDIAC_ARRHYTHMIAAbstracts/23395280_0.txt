Accurate sensing of malignant arrhythmia is critical for the appropriate delivery of therapy from implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and undersensing of ventricular tachyarrhythmias can have catastrophic consequences. Here, we present an unusual case of ventricular fibrillation undersensing from the right ventricular lead at multiple different implantation sites because of very low amplitude voltage signals during induced ventricular fibrillation. A left ventricular sensing electrode was implanted to allow correct sensing and therapy delivery.
