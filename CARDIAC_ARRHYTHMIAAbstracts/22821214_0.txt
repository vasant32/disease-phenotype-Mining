 BACKGROUND: Left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD) may be a therapeutic adjunct for young patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and long QT syndrome (LQTS) who are not fully protected by beta-blockade. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this analysis was to report our institutional experience with LSCD in young patients for the management of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in CPVT and LQTS. METHODS: Ten young patients with CPVT and LQTS underwent transaxillary LSCD at our institution. Mean age at surgery was 14.0 (range 3.9-42) years, mean body weight was 45.7 (range 15.5-90) kg. Five patients had the clinical diagnosis of CPVT, three were genotype positive for a mutation in the ryanodine-receptor-2-gene. Four of five LQTS patients were genotype positive. Indications for LCSD were recurrent syncope, symptomatic episodes of ventricular tachycardias and/or internal cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) discharges, and aborted cardiac arrest despite high doses of beta-blockers. RESULTS: LCSD was performed via the transaxillary approach. No significant complications were observed. Two patients already had an ICD, 6 patients received an ICD at the same operation or shortly thereafter. Median length of follow-up after LCSD was 2.3 (range 0.6-3.9) years. After LCSD a marked reduction in arrhythmia burden and cardiac events was observed in all patients while medication was continued. None of the patients had any further ICD discharge for sustained VT. CONCLUSIONS: After LCSD, arrhythmia burden could significantly be reduced in all our young patients with CPVT and LQTS.
