We report a case of nearly fatal ventricular tachyarrhythmia type Torsade de pointes caused by medication-induced prolongation of QTc duration (methadone, ondansetron, escitalopram). The etiology, pathophysiology, and trigger mechanisms of such malignant arrhythmias are discussed. In order to prevent similar iatrogenic complications in the future, we networked the qtdrug database with our medication interaction control program and installed an automatic electronic warning system for the physicians in charge in case of a digitally recorded prolonged QTc duration.
