Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a disorder of myocardial repolarization characterized by a prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG). This disorder is associated with an increased risk of torsade de pointes (TdP). We report a case of TdP induced by citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), taken in conjunction with amiodarone.
