 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We assessed the value of T-wave alternans (TWA) in prediction of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). METHODS: Consecutive patients (N = 227) were enrolled and were monitored with 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram within 1 to 15 days after AMI. T-wave alternans was identified by a modified moving average (MMA) algorithm computer software. The primary end point was SCD or lethal ventricular arrhythmia. We analyzed the hazard ratios (HRs) using the previously determined 47 μV TWA cutpoint. RESULTS: During the 16 ± 7-month follow-up, 10 (4.4%) patients died suddenly. T-wave alternans (≥47 μV) predicted SCD (HR, 17.78 [95% confidence interval, 3.75-84.31]; P < .0001). Moreover, patients with 5 or more TWA episodes (≥47 μV) were at higher risk for SCD (HR, 20.75 [95% confidence interval, 5.77-74.57]; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: T-wave alternans (≥47 μV) monitored at 1 to 15 days after AMI-predicted heightened risk of SCD. Prediction is improved when the frequency of TWA episodes (≥47 μV) is analyzed.
