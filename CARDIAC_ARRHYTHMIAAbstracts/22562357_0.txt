 PURPOSE: A residual slow pathway after successful cryoablation for atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is correlated with a higher recurrence rate. We described determinants of recurrence in subjects with a residual jump. METHODS: We analyzed the data of subjects with acute successful slow pathway cryoablation for AVNRT using a 6-mm-tip cryocatheter. Success was defined as AVNRT non-inducibility. Patients with no baseline elicitable jump, no inducible AVNRT, and transient first atrioventricular (AV) block at the last site were excluded. RESULTS: From 371 patients who underwent cryoablation from May 2002 to March 2011, 303 fulfilled the entry criteria (mean age, 41 ± 16; 222 women). Baseline AV nodal effective refractory period (ERP) was 272 ± 57 ms, postprocedural 331 ± 64 (P < 0.001), and the mean of the difference (Δ ERP) 60 ± 41. At the end of the procedure, 64 patients (21 %) had a residual jump, of whom 22 with a single echo. At 12 months follow-up, the actuarial recurrence-free rate was 70.3 % in patients with a residual jump and 86 % in those without (P = 0.01). In patients with a jump, only Δ AV nodal ERP was correlated with recurrence (37 ± 41 vs. 68 ± 47 ms; P < 0.04) while a single echo was not. The actuarial rate of recurrence was 60.8 % in patients with a Δ AV nodal ERP ≤ 30 ms and 18.8 % in those with a Δ AV nodal ERP >30 ms (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Suppression of slow pathway conduction is the optimal endpoint for AVNRT cryoablation. A residual jump can be tolerated if AV nodal ERP postcryoablation is prolonged >30 ms.
