 AIMS: Whole body imaging with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) has proven useful in various infectious diseases. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the diagnostic yield of FDG PET/CT in patients with cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 21 patients with CIED infection were prospectively included. Diagnosis of CIED infection was made in accordance with current criteria. It was classified in three categories, i.e. superficial skin infection, pocket site infection, or cardiac device-related infective endocarditis (CDRIE). All patients underwent FDG PET/CT. Scans were interpreted blindly, i.e. without prior knowledge of diagnosis, by experienced nuclear medicine physicians. The accuracy of FDG PET/CT was assessed for each diagnostic category. Findings demonstrated superficial skin infection in 1 patient, pocket site infection in 15, and CDRIE in 13 (definite: 7; possible: 6). In patients with pocket site infection, the sensitivity and specificity of FDG PET/CT were 86.7% [59.5-98.3, 95% confidence interval (CI)] and 100% [42.1-100, 95% CI]. The only patient with superficial skin infection was accurately identified by FDG PET/CT. The sensitivity and specificity of FDG PET/CT in patients with CDRIE were 30.8% [9.1-61.4, 95% CI] and 62.5% [24.5-91.5, 95% CI]. Most false-negative results occurred in patients who had undergone previous antimicrobial treatment. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that FDG PET/CT is highly accurate for the diagnosis of skin and pocket CIED infection but low for infective endocarditis. This suggests that the reliability of FDG PET/CT findings in management decision making varies according to the type of CIED infection.
