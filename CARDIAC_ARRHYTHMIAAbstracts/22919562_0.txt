Congenital left ventricular diverticulum is a rare cardiac malformation characterized by a localized out-pouching from the cardiac chamber. They are most often found in the left ventricle (LV) but have been reported to occur in all chambers of the heart. The patient is usually asymptomatic. However, complications like embolism, infective endocarditis, arrhythmia and, rarely, rupture may be the initial presentation. Diagnosis can be established by echocardiography (EKG), computed tomographic (CT) angiography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We report a case of congenital left ventricular diverticulum in an adult with no valvular abnormality as an incidental finding in an uncommon location.
