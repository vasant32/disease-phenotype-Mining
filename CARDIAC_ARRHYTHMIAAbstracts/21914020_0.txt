Percutaneous Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation. Patients with an atrial septal defect (ASD) commonly have atrial fibrillation (AF) and closure of the ASD rarely controls the arrhythmia. We report on the management of 4 patients with recurrent medically refractory AF in the setting of an unrepaired ASD who underwent percutaneous RFA prior to ASD closure. In 3 of the 4 patients AF was controlled after ablation without antiarrhythmic drug therapy and in the fourth patient AF was controlled with antiarrhythmic therapy after ASD closure. Based on these limited results it seems reasonable to consider RFA of medically refractory AF in patients prior to planned percutaneous ASD closure.
