 PURPOSE: Conventional electroanatomical mapping systems employ roving catheters with one or a small number of electrodes. Maps acquired using these systems usually contain a small number of points and take a long time to acquire. Use of a multielectrode catheter could facilitate rapid acquisition of higher-resolution maps through simultaneous collection of data from multiple points in space; however, a large multielectrode array could potentially limit catheter maneuverability. The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of using a novel, multielectrode catheter to map the right atrium and the left ventricle. METHODS: Electroanatomical mapping of the right atrium and the left ventricle during both sinus and paced rhythm were performed in five swine using a conventional mapping catheter and a novel, multielectrode catheter. RESULTS: Average map acquisition times for the multielectrode catheter (with continuous data collection) ranged from 5.2 to 9.5 min. These maps contained an average of 2,753 to 3,566 points. Manual data collection with the multielectrode catheter was less rapid (average map completion in 11.4 to 18.1 min with an average of 870 to 1,038 points per map), but the conventional catheter was slower still (average map completion in 28.6 to 32.2 min with an average 120 to 148 points per map). CONCLUSIONS: Use of this multielectrode catheter is feasible for mapping the left ventricle as well as the right atrium. The multielectrode catheter facilitates acquisition of electroanatomical data more rapidly than a conventional mapping catheter. This results in shorter map acquisition times and higher-density electroanatomical maps in these chambers.
