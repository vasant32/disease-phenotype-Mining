 BACKGROUND: Transcatheter ablation of accessory pathway (AP)-mediated tachycardia is routinely performed in children. Little data exist regarding the use of magnetic navigation (MN) and its potential benefits for ablation of AP-mediated tachycardia in this population. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective review of prospectively gathered data in children undergoing radiofrequency ablation at our institution since the installation of MN (Stereotaxis Inc, St. Louis, MO) in March 2009. The efficacy and safety between an MN-guided approach and standard manual techniques for mapping and ablation of AP-mediated tachycardia were compared. During the 26-month study period, 145 patients underwent radiofrequency ablation for AP-mediated tachycardia. Seventy-three patients were ablated with MN and 72 with a standard manual approach. There were no significant differences in demographic factors between the 2 groups with a mean cohort age of 13.1Â±4.0 years. Acute success rates were equivalent with 68 of 73 (93.2%) patients in the MN group being successfully ablated versus 68 of 72 (94.4%) patients in the manual group (P=0.889). During a median follow-up of 21.4 months, there were no recurrences in the MN group and 2 recurrences in the manual group (P=0.388). There were no differences in time to effect, number of lesions delivered, or average ablation power. There was also no difference in total procedure time, but fluoroscopy time was significantly reduced in the MN group at 14.0 (interquartile range, 3.8-23.9) minutes compared with the manual group at 28.1 (interquartile range, 15.3-47.3) minutes (P<0.001). There were no complications in either group. CONCLUSIONS: MN is a safe and effective approach to ablate AP-mediated tachycardia in children.
