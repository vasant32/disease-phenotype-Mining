 BACKGROUND: The incidence of silent cerebral lesions (SCL) after atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation is highly variable, depending on the technology used. Recently, an increased risk for SCL has been described for a novel, nonirrigated ablation tool using multielectrode phased radiofrequency (PVAC). The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the incidence and long-term follow-up of SCL in patients undergoing robotically assisted pulmonary vein isolation (RA-PVI) as compared with manual PVI. METHODS AND RESULTS: Circumferential PVI using irrigated radiofrequency current was performed on 70 patients (41 patients with paroxysmal AF, 59%). Fifty patients underwent RA-PVI and 20 patients underwent a manual approach. Cerebral MRI was performed the day before and the day after the ablation procedure; follow-up MRI was performed on 9 of 12 (75%) patients after a follow-up period of 21 months. SCLs were found in 12 of 70 (17%) patients in this study; the incidence of SCLs was similar in patients undergoing RA-PVI as compared with manually ablated patients (n=9, 18% versus n=3, 15%; probability value=1.0). In 1 patient undergoing manual PVI (1%), an SCL with asymptomatic subarachnoid hemorrhage was detected; the bleeding completely resolved within 1 month. Transient ischemic attack occurred in 1 (1%) patient 2 days after manual PVI. After a median follow-up period of 21 months, no residual SCLs were detected. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of SCL using the robotic navigation system was 18% in this study. Incidence and size of SCL appears to be similar after RA-PVI as compared with manual PVI. Repeat MRI showed no residual SCLs at long-term follow-up.
