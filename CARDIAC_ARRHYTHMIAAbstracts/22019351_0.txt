 OBJECTIVE: The 3-bp deletion in exon 2 of the Lamin A/C (LMNA) gene has not been described in association with dilated cardiomyopathy, which is characterized by progressive heart failure, atrioventricular (AV) block, tachyarrhythmias, and variable skeletal muscle involvement. CASE REPORT: In a 43-year-old woman with a long-term history of palpitations and newly diagnosed AV blocks I and II, ventricular ectopic beats, inducible nonsustained ventricular tachycardias (VTs), cardiac arrest, and successful resuscitation, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator was successfully implanted. Her family history was positive for sudden cardiac death (her father and sister), dyspnea and heart failure (her grandmother and sister), palpitations (her brother), and elevated levels of creatine-kinase (CK) (her sister). Two cousins had died of nonspecific muscular dystrophy at ages 10 years and 11 years. Upon neurological investigations revealing sore neck muscles, reduced tendon reflexes, and detached, spot-like white matter lesions bilaterally, a neuromuscular disorder was suspected. The direct sequencing of all exons and flanking intronic regions of the LMNA gene detected the heterozygote 3-bp deletion (AAG) c.367_369del in exon 2 of the gene. This mutation resulted in the deletion of a lysine at position 123 (p.lys123del) in the lamin A/C protein. CONCLUSIONS: The novel 3-bp deletion in exon 2 of the LMNA gene may phenotypically manifest as dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, severe tachyarrhythmias, and muscular dystrophy. Sudden cardiac death from ventricular fibrillation may be prevented in LMNA mutation carriers if the diagnosis is established early enough to implant a cardioverter defibrillator.
