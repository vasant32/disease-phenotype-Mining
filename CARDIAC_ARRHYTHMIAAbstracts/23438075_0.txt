BACKGROUND: Wenxin Keli is a popular Chinese herb extract that approximately five million Asians are currently taking for the treatment of a variety of ventricular arrhythmias. However, its electrophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. METHODS AND RESULTS: The concentration-dependent electrophysiological effects of Wenxin Keli were evaluated in the isolated rabbit left ventricular myocytes and wedge preparation. Wenxin Keli selectively inhibited late sodium current (I(Na) ) with an IC(50) of 3.8 ± 0.4 mg/mL, which was significantly lower than the IC(50) of 10.6 ± 0.9 mg/mL (n = 6, P < 0.05) for the fast I(Na) . Wenxin Keli produced a small but statistically significant QT prolongation at 0.3 mg/mL, but shortened the QT and T(p-e) interval at concentrations ≥1 mg/mL. Wenxin Keli increased QRS duration by 10.1% from 34.8 ± 1.0 ms to 38.3 ± 1.1 ms (n = 6, P < 0.01) at 3 mg/mL at a basic cycle length of 2,000 ms. However, its effect on the QRS duration exhibited weak use-dependency, that is, QRS remained less changed at increased pacing rates than other classic sodium channel blockers, such as flecainide, quinidine, and lidocaine. On the other hand, Wenxin Keli at 1-3 mg/mL markedly reduced dofetilide-induced QT and T(p-e) prolongation by attenuation of its reverse use-dependence and abolished dofetilide-induced early afterdepolarization (EAD) in four of four left ventricular wedge preparations. It also suppressed digoxin-induced delayed afterdepolarization (DAD) and ventricular tachycardias without changing the positive staircase pattern in contractility at 1-3 mg/mL in a separate experimental series (four of four). CONCLUSIONS: Wenxin Keli suppressed EADs, DADs, and triggered ventricular arrhythmias via selective inhibition of late I(Na) .
