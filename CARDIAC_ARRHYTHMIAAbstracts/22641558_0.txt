Accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR) is a ventricular arrhythmia most commonly seen  in adults with underlying cardiac disease. It is important to establish the diagnosis when it  occurs to differentiate this benign phenomenon from dangerous ventricular tachycardia.  We present the case of a healthy child who developed episodes of AIVR associated with propranolol  treatment. Her 24-hour electrocardiography recording showed AIVR with difference  between sinus and ventricular beats. The arrhythmia resolved with the discontinuation of  propranolol, and eventually the case was in sinus rhythm. This patient is the first case of AIVR  associated with propranolol treatment in the literature.
