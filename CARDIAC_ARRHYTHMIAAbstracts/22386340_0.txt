Electrical storm is a challenging diagnosis for the clinician and requires detailed evaluation of the patient. Amiodarone is frequently used for the cessation of ventricular tachycardia attacks. Within antiarrhythmic effects of amiodarone, there are some harmful effects of the recent drug. Thyroid gland toxicity is one of the most important adverse effects of amiodarone and is called amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. Thyrotoxicosis may alter arrhythmia and lead to frequent ventricular tachycardia attacks. Herein, we report a case of electrical storm caused by amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis.
