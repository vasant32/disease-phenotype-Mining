Distinguishing congenital long QT syndrome from QT prolongation caused by drugs or a different underlying disease process is essential for selecting the proper treatment. Herein, we present a case of a patient referred for left cardiac sympathetic denervation as a last resort treatment option for her 19-year standing diagnosis of long QT syndrome with malignant ventricular fibrillation. However, based on her atypical clinical course and additional imaging studies, a diagnosis of left ventricular noncompaction, rather than long QT syndrome, was made. She left the clinic with a drastically different treatment plan and an improved quality of life. Because many cardiac and noncardiac diseases can demonstrate QT prolongation on electrocardiogram, all possible diagnoses should be considered before diagnosing a patient with congenital long QT syndrome especially with regard to the profound treatment implications and genetic follow-up in family members.
