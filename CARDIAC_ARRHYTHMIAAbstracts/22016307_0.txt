A right-sided pneumothorax developed several hours after atrial lead repositioning following otherwise straightforward implantation of a biventricular defibrillator from a left subclavian approach. Right atrial lead perforation was presumed, though this could not be demonstrated on computed tomography. The patient was managed conservatively and made a full recovery.
