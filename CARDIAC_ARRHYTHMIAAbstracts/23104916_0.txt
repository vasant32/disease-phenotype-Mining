This review highlights the role of atrial monophasic action potential duration (APD) in understanding atrial electrical properties in paroxysmal, persistent, and permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) states. Alternans of APD and rate maladaptation in a spatially divergent way appear mechanistically involved in AF initiation, development, and persistence. The underlying pathophysiology warrants further investigation.
