 OBJECTIVE: Elevated preoperative serum creatinine is considered an independent risk factor for postoperative mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. However, the impact of occult renal dysfunction, defined as an impairment of glomerular filtration rate with normal serum creatinine, is still unknown. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of occult renal dysfunction on early outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting. METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational, cohort study of prospectively collected data on 9159 consecutive patients with normal serum creatinine levels undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting between April 1996 and February 2009. Patients were divided into two groups based on preoperative creatinine clearance estimated with the Cockcroft-Gault equation: 5484 patients with a creatinine clearance â‰¥ 60 mL/min and 3675 patients with a creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min (occult renal dysfunction group). RESULTS: Overall in-hospital mortality was 1%. Occult renal dysfunction was associated with a doubling in the risk of operative mortality (1.4% vs 0.7%; P = .001), postoperative renal dysfunction (5.1% vs 2.5%; P < .0001), and need for dialysis (0.8% vs 0.4%; P = .014). Moreover, occult renal dysfunction increased the risk of stroke (1% vs 0.3%; P < .0001), arrhythmia (28.5% vs 21.2%; P < .0001), and hospital stay > 7 days (36.45 vs 24.5%; P < .0001). In a multivariable analysis adjusting for preoperative risk factors, occult renal dysfunction was confirmed to be an independent predictor of mortality (odds ratio, 1.72), postoperative renal dysfunction (odds ratio, 1.9), dialysis (odds ratio, 1.82), stroke (odds ratio, 2.6) arrhythmia (odds ratio, 1.42), and hospital stay > 7 days (odds ratio, 1.65). CONCLUSIONS: Occult renal dysfunction is an independent risk factor for early mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.
