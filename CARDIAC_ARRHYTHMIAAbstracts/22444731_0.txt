Atrial arrhythmia (AA) is common in adult patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). To enable the prevention of AA or its complications, timely identification of adult patients with CHD at risk of AA is crucial. Long total atrial activation times have been related to AA. Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) permits noninvasive evaluation of the total atrial conduction time (PA-TDI duration). The present study evaluated the association between the PA-TDI duration and the development of AA in adult patients with CHD. A total of 223 adult patients with CHD were followed up for the occurrence of AA after PA-TDI duration assessment. The PA-TDI duration was defined as the interval from the onset of the P wave on the electrocardiogram to the peak of the A' wave at the lateral atrial wall on TDI tracings. Among the various clinical and echocardiographic parameters, the association between the PA-TDI duration and AA occurrence was investigated. The median follow-up was 39 months (interquartile range 21 to 57). A PA-TDI duration of â‰¥126 ms was associated with AA during follow-up (log-rank, p <0.001). On multivariate analysis, a PA-TDI duration >126 ms (hazard ratio 2.25, 95% confidence interval 1.21 to 4.19) and history of AA (hazard ratio 4.89, 95% confidence interval 2.75 to 8.71) were independently associated with the occurrence of AA. In conclusion, PA-TDI duration and a history of AA were independently associated with the occurrence of AA in adult patients with CHD. The PA-TDI duration is a useful tool to identify patients with CHD at risk of AA during follow-up.
