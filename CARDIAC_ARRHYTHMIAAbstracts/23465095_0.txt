Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inheritable myocardial disease accounting for ventricular tachycardia and sudden death in the young and arising from areas of fibrofatty replacement of predominantly right ventricular myocardium. That some patients manifest life-threatening ventricular tachycardia in the absence of substantial myocardial replacement suggests that gap junction remodeling might be acting synergistically to ventricular remodeling to promote arrhythmogenesis. Hence, we sought to verify gap junction composition and distribution by analyzing the expression and occurrence of specific gap junction proteins (connexins [Cxs]) in patients with ARVC. Right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy specimens were taken from 16 patients with definite ARVC (age 48 ± 16 years) and analyzed for Cx40, Cx43, and Cx45 messenger ribonucleic acid expression (relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase messenger ribonucleic acid expression). The results were compared to those obtained from nondiseased donor hearts (n = 6; age 32 ± 11 years). The patients with ARVC showed a significant reduction in the messenger ribonucleic acid expression of Cx40 (p <0.0001) and Cx45 (p <0.0001) compared to that of the controls. The expression of Cx43 was similar in patients with ARVC and controls (p = 0.098). Mutations in plakophilin-2 were identified in 7 of 16 patients (25%). The Cx expression levels were comparable between the mutation carriers and noncarriers (p = NS). In conclusion, ARVC features alterations in the expression of Cxs and their distribution at cardiac intercalated discs. Apart from the deposition of extracellular matrix, the potential loss of gap junctions and shift in the composition of gap junctional Cxs in the ventricular conduction system might further contribute to the development of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with ARVC.
