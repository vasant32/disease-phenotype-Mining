Coronary heart disease (CHD) that is due to atherosclerosis is associated with low-grade systemic inflammation. Congestive cardiac failure and arrhythmias that are responsible for mortality in CHD can be suppressed by appropriate vagal stimulation that is anti-inflammatory in nature. Acetylcholine, the principal vagal neurotransmitter, is a potent anti-inflammatory molecule. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) augment acetylcholine release, while acetylcholine can enhance the formation of prostacyclin, lipoxins, resolvins, protectins and maresins from PUFAs, which are anti-inflammatory and anti-arrhythmic molecules. Furthermore, plasma and tissue levels of PUFAs are low in those with CHD and atherosclerosis. Hence, vagal nerve stimulation is beneficial in the prevention of CHD and cardiac arrhythmias. Thus, measurement of catecholamines, acetylcholine, various PUFAs, and their products lipoxins, resolvins, protectins and maresins in the plasma and peripheral leukocytes, and vagal tone by heart rate variation could be useful in the prediction, prevention and management of CHD and cardiac arrhythmias.
