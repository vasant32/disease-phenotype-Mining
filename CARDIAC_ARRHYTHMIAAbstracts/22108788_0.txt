CASE: We report a case of ventricular bigeminy with concomitant administration of methadone, voriconazole and esomeprazole in a Caucasian woman aged 26 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Plasma concentrations of voriconazole and methadone were high, 12.4 mg/l (therapeutic range: 1-4 mg/l) and 1.6 mg/l (therapeutic range: 0.2-0.4 mg/l), respectively. In the absence of esomeprazole, no more episode of cardiac arrhythmia occurred and 7 days after, methadone plasma concentration fell at 0.57 ml/l while voriconazole concentration was at 5.5 mg/l. We speculate that a pharmacokinetic interaction between methadone and voriconazole was amplified by the addition of esomeprazole. This led to the large increase of the plasma concentration of methadone and was potentially responsible for its cardiac toxicity. CONCLUSION: Physicians should be aware of the potential interaction between voriconazole, esomeprazole and methadone leading to arrhythmia. The inhibitory potential of voriconazole is possibly increased by esomeprazole.
