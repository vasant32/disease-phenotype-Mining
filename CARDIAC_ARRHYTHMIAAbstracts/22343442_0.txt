 BACKGROUND: Blunt chest trauma is frequently associated with cardiac contusion and structural damage, most cases only being recognized after death. We report a case of multiple organ trauma, where cardiac failure, caused by tricuspid valve rupture, was markedly delayed. CASE REPORT: A 21 yr old man was admitted to hospital after a car accident. He was suffering from cerebral contusion and oedema, pulmonary contusion, and a left pneumothorax. He also had multiple fractures of the facial bones, orbit, L4 vertebra and left tibia. He was tracheotomised, and a subdural sensor was inserted for continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure. He was sedated and ventilated for two weeks. On the 12th day, his jaw was reconstructed, and immediately after surgery, mild signs of cardiac failure were observed, which were attributed to cardiac contusion. Two weeks after admission, the patient was weaned from the ventilator, and three days later, his facial bones were reconstructed. Four days later, the signs of cardiac failure reappeared. Transoesophageal echocardiography revealed rupture of a head of papillary muscle, with 4th degree tricuspid insufficiency and enlargement of the right ventricle. The ruptured muscle was reconstructed under extracorporeal circulation, and the patient made a satisfactory recovery. DISCUSSION: Acute tricuspid valve insufficiency, albeit rare, may occur in patients with blunt chest trauma. Sedation and lack of physical activity may delay the definite diagnosis, especially when only transthoracic echocardiography is used. Cardiac arrhythmias, diastolic murmur, or signs of congestive cardiac failure in a chest trauma patient may all suggest some structural damage; therefore, transoesophageal echocardiography should be performed as early as possible in such situations.
