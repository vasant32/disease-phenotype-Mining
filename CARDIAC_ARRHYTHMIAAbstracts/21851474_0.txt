A 15 month old boy with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) underwent percutaneous device closure of the VSD. Five days later he collapsed; on arrival to hospital he was asystolic and received prolonged cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with intermittent return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). He had recurrent episodic complete heart block with no ventricular escape rhythm, associated with loss of cardiac output, unresponsive to transcutaneous pacing. He was transferred to theatre, while receiving CPR, for urgent removal of the VSD device. Estimated total 'down time' was 70 min. The device was removed and patch closure of the VSD was performed. He made a full neurological recovery. Device closure of septal defects has become widespread. We discuss the incidence and type of arrythmias associated with their use. This case highlights an uncommon but life threatening complication of a VSD device. It also highlights that good quality CPR may lead to positive outcomes following pediatric cardiac arrest.
