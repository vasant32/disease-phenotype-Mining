From 30 November to 3 December 2010, the 14th edition of the International Symposium on Progress in Clinical Pacing was held in Rome. During this event, experts in the field of electrophysiology and cardiac pacing had the opportunity to meet and exchange their opinions, with the aim of discussing the results of recent studies and to outline future perspectives. In this edition of the congress there was a large attendance of electrophysiologists and clinical cardiologists, with more than 2300 delegates attending from over 50 countries and more than 400 faculty members. The conference was sponsored by the major international arrhythmological scientific societies, including the Heart Rhythm Society, the European Heart Rhythm Association, the Sociedad Latinoamericana and the Asia-Pacific Heart Rhythm Society. In parallel with the medical conference, the fifth edition of the 'Advanced Course of Electrophysiology and Cardiac Pacing', dedicated to cardiological nurses and technicians, was held. The role of the nurse is becoming increasingly important in clinical practice in order to replace physicians in performing noninvasive procedures.
