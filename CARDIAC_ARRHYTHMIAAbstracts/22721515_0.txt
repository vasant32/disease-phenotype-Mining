A 71-year-old valvular patient with cardiac arrhythmia, low ejection fraction, administered angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor underwent aortic and mitral valvular replacement. Starting during normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), hypotension occurred, refractory to phenylephrine, noradrenaline, terlipressin, hydrocortisone and dexchlorpheniramine. After 3 hr of CPB biventricular hyperkinesia, severe hypotension and metabolic acidosis persisted despite volume loading, sodium bicarbonate, adrenaline infusion and intraaortic conterpulsation. Refractory asystole occurred 5 hr postoperatively. The responsability of sepsis and anaphylaxis were ruled out and post-CPB vasoplegic syndrome appeared to be involved. Moderate and severe vasoplegic syndromes are discussed with regards to risk factors, physiology and treatment, including prophylaxis with vasopressin and methylene blue.
