Ischemic heart disease is characterized by hemodynamic adaptations and an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) have been associated with ventricular reentry arrhythmias and can promote the worsening of left ventricular function. This case report discusses the beneficial effects of catheter ablation of frequent premature ventricular complexes originating remote from the healed myocardial infarction scar in the treatment of progressive heart failure.
