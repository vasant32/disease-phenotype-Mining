Unexpected induction of arrhythmias in the heart is still one of the major risks of new drugs despite recent improvements in cardiac safety assays. Here we address this in a novel emerging assay system. Eleven reference compounds were administrated to spontaneously beating clusters of cardiomyocytes from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-CM) and the responses determined using multi-electrode arrays. Nine showed clear dose-dependence effects on field potential (FP) duration. Of these, the Ca(2+) channel blockers caused profound shortening of action potentials, whereas the classical hERG blockers, like dofetilide and d,l-sotalol, induced prolongation, as expected. Unexpectedly, two potent blockers of the slow component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (I(Ks)), HMR1556 and JNJ303, had only minor effects on the extracellular FP of wild-type hPSC-CM despite evidence of functional I(Ks) channels. These compounds were therefore re-evaluated under conditions that mimicked reduced "repolarization reserve," a parameter reflecting the capacity of cardiomyocytes to repolarize and a strong risk factor for the development of ventricular arrhythmias. Strikingly, in both pharmacological and genetic models of diminished repolarization reserve, HMR1556 and JNJ03 strongly increased the FP duration. These profound effects indicate that I(Ks) plays an important role in limiting action potential prolongation when repolarization reserve is attenuated. The findings have important clinical implications and indicate that enhanced sensitization to repolarization-prolonging compounds through pharmacotherapy or genetic predisposition should be taken into account when assessing drug safety.
