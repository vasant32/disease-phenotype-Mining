This systematic review assessed the impact of atrial fibrillation (AF) and pharmacotherapy on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in elderly patients. Highly prevalent in the elderly, AF is associated with morbidity and symptoms affecting HRQOL. A PubMed and EMBASE search (1999-2010) was conducted using the terms atrial fibrillation, elderly, quality of life, Medicare, and Medicaid. In all, 504 articles were identified and 15 were selected (studies examining pharmacotherapy [rate or rhythm control] and HRQOL in AF patients with a mean age â‰¥ 65 years). Information, including study design, cohort size, and HRQOL instruments utilized, was extracted. Five observational studies, 5 randomized trials comparing rate and rhythm control, 3 randomized trials investigating pharmacologic agents, and 2 trials examining HRQOL, depression, and anxiety were identified. Elderly AF patients had reduced HRQOL versus patients in normal sinus rhythm, particularly in domains related to physical functioning. HRQOL may be particularly affected in older AF patients. Although data do not indicate whether a pharmacologic intervention or single treatment strategy-namely rate versus rhythm control-is better at improving HRQOL, either of these strategies and many pharmacologic interventions may improve HRQOL in elderly AF patients. Based on reviewed data, an algorithm is suggested to optimize HRQOL among elderly patients.
