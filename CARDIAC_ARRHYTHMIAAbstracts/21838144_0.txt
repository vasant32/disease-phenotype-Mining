1-[3-(Y-Alkoxyphenylcarbamoyloxy)-2-hydroxypropyl]-4-(2-methylphenyl)piperazinium chlorides (labelled as 7a-7d) were prepared within a complex study of the relationships between the chemical structure, physicochemical properties and biological (antiarrhythmic, antihypertensive) activity of dual acting compounds. Chemical structures of basic forms (labelled as 7a2C-7d2C) and appropriate monochlorides (labelled as 7a-7d) were confirmed by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, MS and IR spectral and elemental analysis. The estimated physicochemical parameters included the melting point data, solubility profile in various media, purity checking (adsorption thin-layer chromatography), surface activity determination (Traube stalagmometric method), acidobasic characteristics (pKa value determination by alkalimetric titration) as well as the log epsilon values estimation by UV/VIS spectrophotometry. Other experimental values under consideration were lipohydrophilic characteristics using reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography (R(M) readouts) RP-HPLC (log k' data) and the log P(exp) s estimated in octan-1-ol/phosphate buffer medium.
