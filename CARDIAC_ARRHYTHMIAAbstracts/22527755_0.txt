Electrical desynchronization in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) occurs when sinus P waves are continually locked in the postventricular atrial refractory period (PVARP). This process is characterized by sequences of a P wave as an atrial event in the PVARP followed by a conducted and sensed ventricular event. Such sequences are more common in patients with a prolonged PR interval, often initiated by premature ventricular complexes (PVC) and terminated by PVCs or slowing of the sinus rate. Specific algorithms automatically identify a recurring pattern of P wave locking in the PVARP, whereupon they shorten the PVARP temporarily until atrial tracking is restored with the programmed sensed AV interval. The Biotronik family of Lumax CRT devices use an AV control window which is not an algorithm that "unlocks" P waves trapped in the PVARP. Rather, it prevents P waves from becoming trapped in the PVARP. A ventricular sensed event occurring within the AV control interval does not start a PVARP so that P wave locking cannot occur when the AV conduction time is shorter than the AV control interval.
