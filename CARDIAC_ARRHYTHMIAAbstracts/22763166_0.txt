During pregnancy, there is an increase in metabolism, oxygen consumption, heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, blood volume and a decrease in blood pressure and peripheral resistance. Studies have shown that during this period the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias is not uncommon. Fortunately, malignant arrhythmias are rare. Herein we report two young patients who presented with symptomatic right ventricular outflow tachycardia during pregnancy that required antiarrhythmic therapy. Possible pathophysiologic mechanisms are discussed.
