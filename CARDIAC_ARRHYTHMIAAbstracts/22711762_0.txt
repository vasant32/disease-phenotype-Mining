 AIMS: This study investigated the relationship between the ostia of the coronary sinus (CS) and the tricuspid annulus (TA) for CS cannulation using a right ventricular (RV) lead, which could map out the TA by forming a curve when placed at the apex or low septum. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy patients (45 males, 67 ± 12 years) who were admitted for CRT device implant were included in the evaluation of the relationship between the CS ostia and TA. An electrophysiological (EP) mapping catheter was used to probe the CS. The ostium was shown by the CS venography at the left anterior oblique (LAO) 20° and caudal 20°. Local electrograms were collected with CS catheters in the CS or RV. Transthoracic echocardiography was evaluated before each procedure. All CS ostia were located within 3.75 cm around the tip of TA. Sixty-two subjects (Group I, 89%) had CS ostia located under the TA. Eight patients (Group II) with CS ostia over the TA revealed larger left ventricular (LV) size and a smaller ratio of left atrium (LA)/LV size. LV enlargement predicted the presence of CS ostia over the TA. Typical CS electrograms were used to further confirm if the EP catheter was in the CS in all the subjects. CONCLUSION: Use of the RV lead revealed that the CS ostia had a close relationship with the TA.
