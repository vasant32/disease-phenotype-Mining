A 79-year-old man presented with relapse of non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma within the scar from his implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation. The ICD was re-sited before he proceeded to chest wall radiotherapy, which resulted in complete remission of the lymphoma. This is the first reported case of lymphoma recurrence within an ICD wound scar.
