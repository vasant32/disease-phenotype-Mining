 PURPOSE: Catheter ablation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) is an effective treatment. Favourable outcomes at 6-12 months post-ablation have been reported using the multi-electrode catheter 'pulmonary vein ablation catheter (PVAC)' but little is known about longer term outcomes. There are also limited data on quality of life (QoL) post-atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation beyond 2 years of follow-up. METHODS: Two hundred three consecutive patients (77 % male, mean age 57.7 ± 11 years) who had a PAF ablation were included. Patients underwent conventional pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) (n = 128) or PVAC ablation (n = 75). Patients' symptoms were scored at baseline, at clinic follow-up and on questionnaire follow-up using the validated Canadian Cardiovascular Society Severity of AF (CCS-SAF) scale. The 'AF Effect on QualiTy of life' (AFEQT) questionnaire was used on questionnaire follow-up. RESULTS: Mean questionnaire follow-up was 854 ± 176 days with 74 % response rate. The majority of patients (91.6 % overall) were highly symptomatic at baseline with CCS-SAF class 3 or 4 symptoms. CCS-SAF class on follow-up questionnaire decreased significantly from baseline for both groups (mean 1.69 ± 1.7 for PVAC and 1.45 ± 1.5 for PVI, p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively) with no difference between groups (p = 0.52) and the majority being class 0 or 1 (59.9 % overall). Mean AFEQT questionnaire scores were similar between both groups (78.1 ± 25 vs. 82 ± 23, p = 0.35). Total procedure time was significantly shorter in the PVAC group (135 ± 54 vs. 178 ± 43 min, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: There was a comparable and significant improvement in QoL post-ablation in patients who underwent ablation using PVAC catheter and conventional techniques.
