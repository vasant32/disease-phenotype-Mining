The potassium channel Kv7.1 is expressed in the heart, where it contributes to the repolarization of the cardiac action potential. Additionally, Kv7.1 is expressed in epithelial tissues playing a role in salt and water transport. We recently demonstrated that surface-expressed Kv7.1 is internalized in response to polarization of the epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line and that this was mediated by activation of protein kinase C (PKC). In this study, the pathway downstream of PKC, which leads to internalization of Kv7.1 upon cell polarization, is elucidated. We show by confocal microscopy that Kv7.1 is endocytosed upon initiation of the polarization process and sent for degradation by the lysosomal pathway. The internalization could be mimicked by pharmacological activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) using three different AMPK activators. We demonstrate that the downstream effector of AMPK is the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2. Additionally, we show that AMPK activation results in a downregulation of Kv7.1 currents in Xenopus oocytes through a Nedd4-2-dependent mechanism. In summary, surface-expressed Kv7.1 channels are endocytosed and sent for degradation in lysosomes by an AMPK-mediated activation of Nedd4-2 during the initial phase of the MDCK cell polarization process.
