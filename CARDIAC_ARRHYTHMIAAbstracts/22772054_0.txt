 AIMS: Duty-cycled radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been used for atrial fibrillation (AF) for around 5 years, but large-scale data are scarce. The purpose of this survey was to report the outcome of the technique. METHODS AND RESULTS: A survey was conducted among 20 centres from seven European countries including 2748 patients (2128 with paroxysmal and 620 with persistent AF). In paroxysmal AF an overall success rate of 82% [median 80%, interquartile range (IQR) 74-90%], a first procedure success rate of 72% [median 74% (IQR 59-83%)], and a success of antiarrhythmic medication of 59% [median 60% (IQR 39-72%)] was reported. In persistent AF, success rates were significantly lower with 70% [median 74% (IQR 60-92%)]; P = 0.05) as well as the first procedure success rate of 58% [median 55% (IQR 47-81%)]; P = 0.001). The overall success rate was similar among higher and lower volume centres and were not dependent on the duration of experience with duty-cycled RFA (r = -0.08, P = 0.72). Complications were observed in 108 (3.9%) patients, including 31 (1.1%) with symptomatic transient ischaemic attack or stroke, which had the same incidence in paroxysmal and persistent AF (1.1 vs. 1.1%) and was unrelated to the case load (r = 0.24, P = 0.15), bridging anticoagulation to low molecular heparin, routine administration of heparin over the long sheath, whether a transoesophageal echocardiogram was performed in every patient or not and average procedure times. CONCLUSION: Duty-cycled RFA has a self-reported success and complication rate similar to conventional RFA. After technical modifications a prospective registry with controlled data monitoring should be conducted to assess outcome.
