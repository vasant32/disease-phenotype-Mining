 AIMS: Fibrosis and inflammation may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence. Type III procollagen-N-peptide (PIIINP) may be related to atrial fibrosis and play a role in predicting the recurrence of AF. We investigated whether PIIINP as a fibrosis marker predicts the recurrence of AF after cardioversion. METHODS AND RESULTS: Serum PIIINP, interleukin-6, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, brain natriuretic peptide, renin and aldosterone were measured at baseline and 24 months in 88 patients (62%) with sinus rhythm (SR) maintenance and 54 patients (38%) with AF recurrence. Furthermore, the root mean square voltage in the last 20 ms (RMS20) via P-wave signal-averaged electrocardiogram (P-SAECG) was measured and the relationship between fibrosis biomarkers and RMS20 was examined. Baseline PIIINP with AF recurrence was significantly higher than for those with SR maintenance (0.664 vs. 0.581 U/mL, P = 0.001). However, there were no significant differences in other biomarkers. A logistic regression identified PIIINP (odds ratio 2.61, P = 0.008) as an independent predictor of AF recurrence. The RMS20 as measured by P-SAECG with SR maintenance and PIIINP levels <0.72 U/mL (at baseline) was significantly higher after 24 months than at baseline. Furthermore, the RMS20 with AF recurrence and PIIINP levels >0.72 U/mL (at baseline) was significantly lower after 24 months than baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated baseline PIIINP concentration is an independent predictor for AF recurrence after cardioversion. Furthermore, there is a relationship between PIIINP and RMS20 and the fibrosis of AF.
