Radiofrequency catheter ablation without active cooling of the catheter tip is associated with significantly increased risk of thrombus formation and thromboembolism, especially when multiple and high-energy deliveries are considered. Therefore, irrigation of the distal electrode has become obligatory for catheter ablation of complex cardiac arrhythmias. The advancement in the cooling catheter technology is aimed to further reduce the risk of steam pop as well as coagulum formation on both electrode and tissue, and to maximize energy transfer to the tissue. Whether novel catheter designs will translate into better success rates of catheter ablation and lower risk of complications remains to be evaluated by upcoming studies. In future, a combination with novel sensors that enable online monitoring of lesion creation is expected. Such technology should allow optimization of radiofrequency delivery without risk of deep tissue overheating and steam pop creation. Recent patents in the field irrigated catheter ablation focus mainly on novel porous materials that would enable diffuse irrigation around the catheter tip and alternative layout of irrigation holes. Additionally, some patents deal with combination of irrigation fluid tubing and different sensors located within the catheter tip.
