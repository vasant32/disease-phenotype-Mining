We present the case of a 82-year-old woman with a history of total thyroidectomy who was admitted in hospital with severe hypocalcemia. A 12-lead surface ECG revealed atrial fibrillation along with an extremely prolonged QT interval of approximately 730ms. In the absence of any other possible cause of QT interval prolongation, hypocalcemia was attributed to surgical hypoparathyroidism and undue discontinuation of calcium supplementation. Surprisingly, no ventricular arrhythmias were recorded and calcium repletion was followed by normalization of QT interval.
