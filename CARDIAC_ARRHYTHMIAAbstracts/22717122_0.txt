Childhood cardiac arrhythmias may have a long-lasting impact on a family and typically require long-term medical follow-up. Whereas some arrhythmias are benign, others can be life threatening and require significant medical care. As with many chronic illnesses, it is important to study the potential psychosocial effects of childhood arrhythmias and how they may impact a child's quality of life. The purpose of this study was to create a quality of life measure specific to childhood arrhythmias and to describe the current psychosocial functioning of this population. A total of 46 families participated in a one-time paper and pencil assessment during their regularly scheduled clinic visits. Results indicated promise for the validity and reliability of this new measure. Children in the current sample also demonstrated a high degree of resiliency. Additional analyses with larger samples will be needed to verify the psychometric properties of this measure. Overall, the high functioning of many of these children despite medical trauma is promising. Future studies should consider using some screening measures to decide which children may be most in need of intervention.
