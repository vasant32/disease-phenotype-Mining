Due to the increasing number of patients and complexity of modern tachycardia devices, efficient therapy monitoring as offered by telemedicine monitoring is of increasing importance. The potential advantages of remote control for patient management include early detection of device-related technical problems and arrhythmias. We report the case of an ICD patient with incessant ventricular tachycardia in whom immediate arrhythmia transmission was monitored by remote control.
