 BACKGROUND: Premature ventricular and supraventricular complexes (PVC and PsVC) are frequent and often symptomatic. The magnesium (Mg) ion plays a role in the physiology of cell membranes and cardiac rhythm. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated whether the administration of Mg Pidolate (MgP) in patients with PVC and PsVC is superior to placebo (P) in improving symptoms and arrhythmia frequency. METHODS: Randomized double-blind study with 60 consecutive symptomatic patients with more than 240 PVC or PsVC/h on 24-hour Holter monitoring who were selected to receive placebo (P) or MgP. To evaluate symptom improvement, a categorical and a specific questionnaire for symptoms related to PVC and PsVC was made. Improvement in premature complex density (PCD) per hour was considered significant if percentage reduction was >70% after treatment. The dose of MgP was 3.0 g/day for 30 days, equivalent to 260 mg of Mg element. Any patient had structural heart disease or renal failure. RESULTS: Of the 60 patients, 33 were female (55%). Ages ranged from 16 to 70 years old. In the MgP group, 76.6% of patients had a PCD reduction >70%, 10% of them >50% and only 13.4% <50%. In the P group, 40% showed slight improvement, <30%, in the PC frequency (p < 0.001). Symptom improvement was achieved in 93.3% of patients in the MgP group, compared with only 16.7% in the P group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Oral Mg supplementation decreases PCD, resulting in symptom improvement.
