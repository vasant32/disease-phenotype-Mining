To investigate the effects of gradually guided breathing on respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), 15 healthy men's simultaneous ECG and respiratory signals during the guided breathing process (14 beats/min-12.5 beats/ min--1 beats/min--9.5 beats/min--8 beats/minute--7 beats/min) were acquired. Based on the frequency domain and time domain methods, the effects of respiratory rate on RSA were studied. A general tendency increase features the three parameters of RSA as respiratory rate decreased. RSA represents the reflection control of respiratory system to cardiovascular system. The results suggested that the function of the reflection control of respiratory system to cardiovascular system increaseed with guided breathing decreasing. The conclusion indicates that the cardiovascular system could be improved by regulating the mode of respiration.
