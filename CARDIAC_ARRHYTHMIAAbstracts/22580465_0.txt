Cardiac cryoablation applied for treating cardiac arrhythmias has shown promising results after intervention, particularly for the creation of elongated lesions. A model for simulating and assessing cryoablation interventions was developed, evaluated and validated with animal experiments. We employed two simulations of different freezing outlet settings for a loop shaped cryocatheter, applying Pennes heat equation for cardiac tissue. Our experiments demonstrated that an equidistantly spaced freezing outlet distribution of 5mm led to an improved formation of lesions, i.e., elongated lesions were observed throughout the transmural cardiac volume and on the epicardial structure. A complete transmural frozen lesion was not achieved with a freezing outlet distance of 10mm. These simulation results could be experimentally verified by morphological and histological examinations. Using our simulation model we were able to optimize the intervention procedure by predicting and assessing the freezing process. This should further increase the success rate of cardiac cryoablation in clinical interventions.
