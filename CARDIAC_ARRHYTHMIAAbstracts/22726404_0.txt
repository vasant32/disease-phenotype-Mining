 BACKGROUND: The challenge of visceral heterotaxy (VH) in the developing world has not been analysed in detail. METHOD: Retrospective chart review of 69 consecutive patients over ten years assessed the clinical profile and surgical outcome of VH. Median age: 3 years; median weight: 15kg. Diagnosis was made by echocardiography supplemented with blood smear (Howell Jolly bodies), Multi-Detector Computed Tomography (MDCT) angiogram and/or surgical inspection. RESULTS: In right isomerism (RI) group (n=32), 12 patients did not undergo surgery, five had Blalock Taussig shunt, 14 had bidirectional Glenn and one had Fontan completion, with surgical mortality of 5%. In left isomerism (LI) group (n=31), 11 patients underwent two ventricle repair (35%) and 15 (48%) had single ventricle repair, with surgical mortality of 3.8%; five did not have surgery. On follow up (median period 1.5 years), 33% of un-operated patients and 25% of operated patients died, mortality being higher for RI patients. Late mortality was due to sepsis, heart failure or arrhythmia. CONCLUSION: VH can be diagnosed by imaging based criteria. VH tends to present late in the developing world with a significant percentage inoperable. LI had better surgical outcome and higher long term survival.
