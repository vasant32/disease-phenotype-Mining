 OBJECTIVES: To investigate the feasibility of using a prospective ECG-gated wide-volume protocol in CT angiography (CTA) of the whole aorta and coronary arteries (CA). METHODS: A total of 61 consecutive patients with suspected acute aortic diseases underwent CTA of the whole aorta using a prospective ECG-gated wide-volume CT protocol without heart rate (HR) control. The exposure window was set at 40-50 % of R-R interval (HR ≥70 bpm) or 70-80 % of R-R interval (HR <70 bpm) in a single heartbeat. The image quality of the ascending aorta, aortic valve and CA was evaluated for motion artefacts. The mean attenuation was measured at different levels of the aorta. The radiation dose and contrast medium volume were recorded. RESULTS: All of the examinations were performed successfully. The image quality was acceptable in the ascending aorta, aortic valve (100 %) and CA (94.4 %). The mean radiation dose was 18.42 ± 5.02 mSv. Of 61 patients, 14 were diagnosed with aortic aneurysm and 35 were diagnosed with aortic dissection or intramural haematoma. Coronary artery stenosis was detected in 12 patients. CONCLUSION: For patients with aortic diseases, CTA of the whole aorta using a prospective ECG-gated wide-volume protocol has the potential to provide additional information about the CA and aortic valve with lower radiation exposure.                                                   KEY POINTS                 :                  • Computed tomography is increasingly used to assess the coronary arteries and the aorta.                                  • This novel study investigates prospective ECG-gated wide-volume 320-row CT angiography.                                  • Heart rate variation did not influence the image quality of coronary arteries.                                  • Abnormalities in the coronary arteries and aorta can be simultaneously assessed noninvasively.
