 AIMS: To characterize the electromagnetic field emitted by the electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB) superDimension(®) Bronchus system (SDBS) and to determine whether current implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) systems are suitable for use in conjunction with SDBS. METHODS AND RESULTS: The electromagnetic emission of the SDBS location board were measured using a field strength meter connected to a low-frequency (5 Hz-100 kHz) electric and magnetic field analyser; the static magnetic field was measured using a three-axis Tesla meter. A human torso simulator was used in the in vitro experiment: a polyethylene plastic box (61 cm length × 43 cm depth × 16.5 cm height) was filled with a semisolid gel and a 0.45% saline solution to provide electric conductance similar to tissue. The ICDs were immersed 1 cm into the gel and connected with a dual-coil integrated bipolar pacing/sensing/shock lead. Tip and right ventricular coil of the lead were connected to an arrhythmia simulator using low-impedance cables. The system transmits electromagnetic waves of 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 kHz frequency. The maximum magnetic fields measured were B = 53 and 12 µT at location board plane and at ICD plane, respectively. Corresponding figures for the electric field were E = 16.6 and 4.4 V/m. None of the tested ICDs recorded any noise signal during the period in which the location board was switched-on. Stored electrogram analysis confirmed the correct detection of simulated tachyarrhythmia and therapy delivery by every tested ICD. CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrated that tested ICDs are compatible with ENB performed with SDBS. They also suggest that these results may be extended to all ICDs manufactured in compliance with current EN regulations.
