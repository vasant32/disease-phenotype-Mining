The Na,K-ATPase is specifically inhibited by cardiotonic steroids (CTSs) like digoxin and is of significant therapeutic value in the treatment of congestive heart failure and arrhythmia. Recently, new interest has arisen in developing Na,K-ATPase inhibitors as anticancer agents. In the present study, we compare the potency and rate of inhibition as well as the reactivation of enzyme activity following inhibition by various cardiac glycosides and their aglycones at different pH values using shark Na,K-ATPase stabilized in the E2MgPi or in the E2BeFx conformations. The effects of the number and nature of various sugar residues as well as changes in the positions of hydroxyl groups on the β-side of the steroid core of cardiotonic steroids were investigated by comparing various cardiac glycoside compounds like ouabain, digoxin, digitoxin, and gitoxin with their aglycones. The results confirm our previous hypothesis that CTS binds primarily to the E2-P ground state through an extracellular access channel and that binding of extracellular Na(+) ions to K(+) binding sites relieved the CTS inhibition. This reactivation depended on the presence or absence of the sugar moiety on the CTS, and a single sugar is enough to impede reactivation. Finally, increasing the number of hydroxyl groups of the steroid was sterically unfavorable and was found to decrease the inhibitory potency and to confer high pH sensitivity, depending on their position on the steroid β-face. The results are discussed with reference to the recent crystal structures of Na,K-ATPase in the unbound and ouabain-bound states.
