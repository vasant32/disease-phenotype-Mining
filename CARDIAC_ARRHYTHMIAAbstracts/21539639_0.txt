Ablate and pace for POTS. A 42-year-old woman with postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) was admitted to our hospital with severe palpitations, light-headedness, and syncope. Several drugs had been administered previously, but all had been discontinued due to intolerable adverse effects or limited efficacy. One of the drugs, the I(f) current inhibitor ivabradine, effectively slowed the patient's heart rate and relieved the symptoms, but was discontinued due to allergy. After unsuccessful sinus node ablation, atrioventricular node ablation and dual chamber pacemaker implantation was performed, which dramatically improved her symptoms and eliminated syncope. Atrioventricular node ablation could modify the cardiac autonomic balance and thereby suppressed the excessive orthostatic sympathetic activity.
