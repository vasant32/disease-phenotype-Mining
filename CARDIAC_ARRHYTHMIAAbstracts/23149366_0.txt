This report presents a 55-year-old man admitted for respiratory failure, who was found to have a brief run of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT) with normal QT interval. The importance of differentiating PVT caused by torsades de pointes and PVT with normal QT interval is emphasized. This distinction is crucial because of the differing etiologies and management of these arrhythmias.
