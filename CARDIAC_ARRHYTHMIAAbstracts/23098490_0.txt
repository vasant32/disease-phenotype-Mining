B7-H3 is a newly discovered member of the B7/CD28 superfamily which functions as an important T-cell immune molecule. It has been reported recently that B7-H3 is highly expressed in many cancer cells, the data indicating that it may be a regulation factor contributing to tumor-resistance. In our study, we used bioinformatics to identify differentially expressed genes between colonic cancer cells and normal colonic cells, aiming to analyze mechanisms and identify sub-pathways closely related to progression, with the final aim of finding small molecule drugs which might interfere this progression. We found that ajmaline is one related factor which may enhance self-immunity in colon carcinoma therapy and B7-H3 plays important roles with regard to immunoreactions of colonic cancer cells. All the results indicate that H7-B3 is a favorable prognostic biomarker for colon carcinomas, providing novel information regarding likely targets for intervention.
