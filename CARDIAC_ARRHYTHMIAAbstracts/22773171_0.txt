Left ventricular noncompaction (LNVC), first described in 1984, is a rare congenital cardiomyopathy that is thought to be caused by arrest of normal embryogenesis of the endocardium and the myocardium, and characterized by multiple prominent trabeculations with deep intertrabecular recesses. LVNC can be associated with other congenital cardiac abnormalities such as atrial septal defect and ventricular septal defect, but it can occur in isolation. The clinical manifestations of the disease are variable, ranging from no symptoms to signs of heart failure, systemic emboli, and ventricular arrhythmias. The diagnosis is established by two dimensional echocardiography or magnetic resonance imaging. We report the case of a 44-year-old man with LVNC and discuss the role of multimodal imaging in the diagnosis and assessment of the disease.
