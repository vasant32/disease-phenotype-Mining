Due to its safety profile, cryoablation is used increasingly in pediatric patients, especially for septal arrhythmia substrates. Recent advances in electroanatomical-mapping technologies have resulted in a decrease or complete elimination of fluoroscopy exposure during catheter ablation procedures. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of cryoablation of anteroseptal accessory pathways (APs) using electroanatomical-mapping system guidance with limited fluoroscopy exposure. A total of 24 patients underwent cryoablation of anteroseptal APs between July 2010 and April 2012. Cryomapping was performed with a 6 mm-tip catheter at -30 °C before the lesions were delivered. An 8 mm-tip catheter was used in one patient. The EnSite system (St. Jude Medical, St Paul, MN) was used in all procedures. The mean age was 11.9 ± 4.3 years. Acute success rate was 95.8 % (23 of 24). The mean procedure and cryoablation durations were 168 ± 58 min and 1,463 ± 525 s, respectively. Limited fluoroscopy was used only in 7 patients, and the mean fluoroscopy time was 1.7 ± 1.8 min (range 0.1-4 min) in these patients. Recurrence was noted in 2 patients (8.7 %) who underwent a second successful cryoablation procedure. The patient who underwent a failed attempt during the first procedure was successfully treated with a repeat procedure. The resultant long-term success rate was 100 % at a mean follow-up period of 14.2 ± 7.7 months. There were no complications except for transient atrioventricular block in one patient. Cryoablation of anteroseptal APs can be performed effectively and safely in children using a limited fluoroscopic approach with the help of electroanatomical-mapping systems.
