This prospective study evaluated 19 individuals with refractory focal or generalized epilepsy utilizing an implantable cardiac loop recorder. Recording averaged 15 months (range 12-19 months) in 18 patients and 1.5 months in one patient. A median of 37 seizures per patient (range 3-657) occurred, with 1,477 seizures total. Cardiac arrhythmias and repolarization abnormalities occurred frequently (in 42% of patients) in refractory epilepsy, particularly during generalized tonic-clonic and tonic seizures. Patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome may be at high risk for cardiac abnormalities.
