 BACKGROUND: Verapamil (Ver) is a well known, worldwide used drug to correct cardiac arrhythmias. The main Ver target is the L-type calcium channel. Modulation of calcium homeostasis vaulted Ver into use in medical applications. METHODS: To examine COLO 205 cells morphology after Ver treatment, an electron microscopy technique was used. RESULTS: This study shows ultrastructural evidence that Ver initiates autophagy-like process in human colon adenocarcinoma COLO 205 cells. TEM photographs revealed the presence of differently developed autophagic vacuoles in response to Ver administration. Furthermore, extensive ultrastructural cell alterations confirmed that cancer cells died via necrosis or apoptosis, as demonstrated by ruptured plasma membrane or condensed chromatin, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: It is the evidence that apoptosis resistant COLO 205 cells are overruled by autophagy-like process. Autophagy-like cell death could be a promising venue to delete cancer cells. Ver appears to be a new potentially effective anticancer compound.
