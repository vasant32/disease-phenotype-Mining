Bisphenol A (BPA) is an environmental estrogenic endocrine disruptor that may have adverse health impacts on a range of tissue/systems. In previous studies, we reported that BPA rapidly promoted arrhythmias in female rodent hearts through alteration of myocyte calcium handling. In the present study we investigated the acute effects of BPA on ventricular arrhythmias and infarction following ischemia-reperfusion in rat hearts. Rat hearts were subjected to 20min of global ischemia followed by reperfusion. In female, but not male hearts, acute exposure to 1nM BPA, either alone or combined with 1nM 17β-estradiol (E2), during reperfusion resulted in a marked increase in the duration of sustained ventricular arrhythmias. BPA plus E2 increased the duration ventricular fibrillation, and the duration of VF as a fraction of total duration of sustained ventricular arrhythmia. The pro-arrhythmic effects of estrogens were abolished by MPP combined with PHTPP, suggesting the involvements of both ERα and ERβ signaling. In contrast to their pro-arrhythmic effects, BPA and E2 reduced infarction size, agreeing with previously described protective effect of estrogen against cardiac infarction. In conclusion, rapid exposure to low dose BPA, particularly when combined with E2, exacerbates ventricular arrhythmia following IR injury in female rat hearts.
