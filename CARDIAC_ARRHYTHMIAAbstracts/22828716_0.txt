Information about the QT interval from surface electrocardiograms (ECGs) is essential for surveillance of the proarrhythmia potential of marketed drugs. However, ECG records obtained in daily practice cannot be easily used for this purpose without labor-intensive manual effort. This study was aimed at constructing an open-access QT database, the Electrocardiogram Vigilance with Electronic Data Warehouse (ECG-ViEW). This longitudinal observational database contains 710,369 measurements of QT and associated clinical data from 371,401 patients. The de-identified database is freely available at http://www.ecgview.org.
