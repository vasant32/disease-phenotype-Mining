 BACKGROUND: The advent of metabolic surgery and the increasing focus on the substantial resolution rate of type 2 diabetes after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) call for additional fundamental investigations as to the mechanisms behind this effect. These investigations require an adequate animal model. Our objective was to develop a reproducible survival model of LRYGB performed in a large animal at a tertiary university hospital. METHODS: LRYGB was performed on 11 Yorkshire pigs that where then followed for 6 weeks. The operative time, morbidity, and mortality were recorded for each case. Necropsy was performed, and the anastomoses were harvested and inspected for leaks. RESULTS: The surgical technique and difficulties are carefully described. Of the 11 pigs, 10 survived to the end of the study period. The 1 death was from intraoperative cardiac dysrhythmia. The postoperative complications consisted of a postoperative febrile episode in 2 pigs. The mean initial weight was 31.5 ± 3.4 kg. The mean operative time was 214 ± 71 minutes. No anastomotic leaks were identified at necropsy or on histologic examination of anastomoses. The mean weight gain at the end of the study period was .8 ± 1.4 kg compared with an expected 17.5 kg weight gain. CONCLUSION: We have described an effective survival porcine model of LRYGB that can be consistently reproduced. This will enable additional investigation into the complex physiologic mechanisms that control hunger, weight loss, and the development, as well as resolution, of type 2 diabetes, potentially leading to the development of novel, targeted bariatric procedures and diabetic treatments.
