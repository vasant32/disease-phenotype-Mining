This report describes the de novo occurrence of pacemaker-mediated tachycardia (PMT) in a patient with a dual-chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and stable retrograde ventriculoatrial conduction time. The same rate-adaptive post-ventricular atrial refractory period (PVARP) duration had previously prevented PMT. Oversensing of atrial false signals from a defective lead shortened the PVARP with consequent sensing of retrograde conduction.
