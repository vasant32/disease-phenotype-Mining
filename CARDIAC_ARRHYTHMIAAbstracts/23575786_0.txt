Lyme carditis can be a clinical manifestation of the early disseminated stage of Lyme disease caused by the tick-transmitted pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi. We present the case of a 41 year-old Caucasian woman referred to our hospital with symptoms of fatigue, progressive exertional dyspnoea, supraventricular cardiac arrhythmia, and an enlarged heart revealed on chest radiography. Following an untypical result of transthoracic echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance was performed. This showed structural cardiac changes and focus of late gadolinium enhancement in the midwall of the apex region. Further diagnostic processes, including endomyocardial biopsy and serology tests, made it possible to diagnose Lyme carditis. Clinical observation was followed-up for three years.
