 OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether patients with an elevated left ventricular mass index undergoing cardiac surgery were more likely to experience postoperative atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. DESIGN: A retrospective analysis. SETTING: A single tertiary care university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand consecutive patients undergoing all types of adult cardiac surgery. INTERVENTIONS: With institutional review board approval, intraoperative transesophageal echocardiographic images were reviewed by a single reviewer. The left ventricular mass index was calculated using the American Society of Echocardiography-recommended formula. Medical charts were reviewed for the occurrence and type of clinically significant postoperative arrhythmias. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Of the patients who had an elevated left ventricular mass index, 47.6% (225/473) developed clinically significant postoperative arrhythmias compared with 38.3% (142/371) of patients with a normal left ventricular mass index (odds ratio [OR] = 1.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.93; p = 0.007). In the multivariate analysis, this finding remained statistically significant, controlling for the effects of age, weight, sex, surgery type, left ventricular function, functional status, left atrial dimensions, and a history of atrial fibrillation (OR = 1.40; 95% CI, 1.03-1.90 per 100-g/m(2) increase in the left ventricular mass index). An increased left ventricular mass index was also an independent predictor of the separate or combined occurrence of atrial or ventricular arrhythmias. CONCLUSIONS: An elevated left ventricular mass index was a strong independent predictor of clinically significant postoperative atrial and ventricular arrhythmias after adult cardiac surgery. Although prospective validation is required, targeting patients for arrhythmia prophylaxis therapy may be justified in patients with a left ventricular mass index >188 g/m(2).
