Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia found in older adults that places them at a high risk for stroke. The presence of AF in an individual, especially older than 60 years, increases the risk of mortality, affects quality of life, and increases prevalence of heart failure. The goal of AF treatment is to maintain heart rate or rhythm control and stroke prevention through anticoagulation. With appropriate management of AF an improvement of symptoms and a reduced morbidity from stroke or heart failure can be achieved. The best treatment for AF is prevention and early diagnosis.
