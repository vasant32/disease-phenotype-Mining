 We report the first use of a new platform, the Guiraudon Universal Cardiac Introducer (GUCI), in humans for accessing the left atrium for catheter-based ablations in patients with resistant atrial arrhythmias after total cavopulmonary derivation. The GUCI was originally designed for intracardiac access for closed, beating instrumental intracardiac surgery.The patient was a 29-year-old man with problematic atrial arrhythmias resistant to antiarrhythmic drugs because of severe uncontrolled bradycardia and because his pacemaker was explanted for infection.The GUCI was attached to the left atrial appendage via an anterior left thoracotomy. The GUCI was modified to accommodate introduction and manipulation of multiple catheters. This allowed electrophysiologists to perform catheter-based exploration and ablation. A DDD pacemaker was implanted, with an atrial endocardial lead introduced via the GUCI cuff and a ventricular epicardial lead.Postoperative atrial arrhythmias were controlled using amiodarone and atrial pacing. At the 12-month follow-up, the patient was arrhythmia- and drug-free and returned to full employment.This new access offers an additional new alternative atrial access to treat resistant arrhythmia after total cavopulmonary derivation. The current state-of-the-art makes patient selection difficult and uncomfortable for the surgeons because of incomplete preoperative electrophysiological data, such as a return to the beginning of surgery for arrhythmia; however, more cumulative experience with intraoperative electrophysiological data and new mapping technologies should address these limitations.
