 UNLABELLED: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a very frequent supraventricular arrhythmia, particularly during the first month after an acute myocardial infraction. The aim of this study is the evaluation of its incidence, and to search predictor factors. PATIENTS AND METHOD: From May 2004 to May 2005, 133 patients (58.5Â±11.2years) are retrospectively included. After a stay in intensive care unit, they go to cardiac re-adaptation unit. RESULTS: Twenty among them made at least one episode of AF, during the first month after the infraction (FA+ group). The other one kept a sinusal rhythm (FA- group). The incidence was 15%. The FA is associated with age (P<0.001), high blood pressure (P<0.016), no smoking status (P<0.025) and ejection fraction less than 45% (P<0.028). But left atrium dilatation is the only independent predictor factor of FA occur, as our study (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: AF is a frequent complication during the first month following a myocardial infraction. The only identified predictor factor is left atrium dilatation.
