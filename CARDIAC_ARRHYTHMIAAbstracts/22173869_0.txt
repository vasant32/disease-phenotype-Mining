Anandamide is an endocannabinoid that has antiarrhythmic effects through inhibition of L-type Ca(2+) channels in cardiomyocytes. In this study, we investigated the electrophysiological effects of anandamide on K(+) channels in rat ventricular myocytes. Whole cell patch-clamp technique was used to record K(+) currents, including transient outward potassium current (I(to)), steady-state outward potassium current (I(ss)), inward rectifier potassium current (I(K1)), and ATP-sensitive potassium current (I(KATP)) in isolated rat cardiac ventricular myocytes. Anandamide decreased I(to) while increasing I(KATP) in a concentration-dependent manner but had no effect on I(ss) and I(K1) in isolated ventricular myocytes. Furthermore, anandamide shifted steady-state inactivation curve of I(to) to the left and shifted the recovery curve of I(to) to the right. However, neither cannabinoid 1 (CB(1)) receptor antagonist AM251 nor CB(2) receptor antagonist AM630 eliminated the inhibitory effect of anandamide on I(to). In addition, blockade of CB(2) receptors, but not CB(1) receptors, eliminated the augmentation effect of anandamide on I(KATP). These data suggest that anandamide suppresses I(to) through a non-CB(1) and non-CB(2) receptor-mediated pathway while augmenting I(KATP) through CB(2) receptors in ventricular myocytes.
