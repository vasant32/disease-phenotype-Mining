Antiarrhythmic therapy of patients with disturbed automatism of the sinus node and impaired atrioventricular conductance may be complicated by hemodynamically significant bradycardias and contraindications for implantation of a cardiac electrical stimulator This study aimed at estimating effect of antiarrhythmic therapy with allapinin on the function of sinus and atrioventricular nodes. It included 20 patients (mean age 37.5+-2.3 years) with disturbed cardiac rhythm and sinus node dysfunction treated with allapinin (37.5 - 50 mg/d per os). This therapy had well apparent antiarrhythmic effect manifest as improvement of supraventricular and ventricular ectopic activities in the absence of negative influence on the function of sinus and atrioventricular nodes.
