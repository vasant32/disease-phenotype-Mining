Mendelian cardiomyopathies and arrhythmias are characterized by an important genetic heterogeneity, rendering Sanger sequencing very laborious and expensive. As a proof of concept we explored multiplex targeted high-throughput sequencing as a fast and cost-efficient diagnostic method for individuals suffering from mendelian cardiac disorders. We designed a DNA capture assay including all exons from 130 genes involved in cardiovascular mendelian disorders and analysed simultaneously 4 samples by multiplexing. Two patients had familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and 2 patients suffered from long-QT syndrome (LQTS). In patient 1 with HCM, we identified two known pathogenic missense variants in the two most frequently mutated sarcomeric genes MYH7 and MYBPC. In patient 2 with HCM, a known acceptor splice site variant in MYBPC3 was found. In patient 3 with LQTS, two missense variants in the genes SCN5A and KCNQ were identified. Finally, in patient 4 with LQTS a known missense variant was found in MYBPC3 which usually is mutated in patients with cardiomyopathy. Our results demonstrate that multiplex targeted High-Throughput-Sequencing works as an efficient and cost-effective tool for molecular diagnosis of heterogeneous disorders in clinical practice and offers new insights in the pathogenesis of these complex diseases.
