In a variant proportion of patients presenting with chest pain and electrocardiographic changes charactheristic for ST - elevation myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention achieve epicardial coronary artery reperfusion but not myocardial reperfusion (ranging from 5% to 50%); furthermore, prolonged myocardial ischemia often breaks down the coronary microvasculature and the flow to the infarct myocardium may be markedly reduced. This condition is known as no reflow - phenomenon. The no reflow - phenomenon is associated with an increased incidence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure and 30-days mortality. In the recent years in literature several articles (subsequently discussed in the present review) have been published and made relevant to the study of the pathophysiology of no reflow - phenomenon; such knowledge has helped the development of new treatment strategies such as prophylactic use of vasodilators, mechanical devices and drugs inhibiting platelet. The aim of this review is to analyze the current literature about intra - coronary injection of drugs to treat no - reflow and microvascular dysfunction.
