Prrxl1-CreER(T2) transgenic mice expressing tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase were generated by modifying a Prrxl1-containing BAC clone. Cre recombination activity was examined in Prrxl1-CreER(T2); Rosa26 reporter mice at various embryonic and postnatal stages. Pregnant mice were treated with a single dose of tamoxifen at embryonic day (E) 9.5 or E12.5, and X-gal staining was performed 2 days later. Strong X-gal staining was observed in the somatosensory ganglia (e.g., dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia) and the first central sites for processing somatosensory information (e.g., spinal dorsal horn and trigeminal nerve-associated nuclei). When tamoxifen was administered at postnatal day (P) 20 or in adulthood (P120), strong Cre recombination activity was present in the primary somatosensory ganglia, while weak Cre recombination activity was found in the spinal dorsal horn, mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, principal sensory trigeminal nucleus, and spinal trigeminal nucleus. This mouse line provides a useful tool for exploring genes' functions in the somatosensory system in a time-controlled way.
