 PURPOSE: This study assessed ablation techniques, recurrent arrhythmias, long-term outcomes, and complications of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients 65 years of age. METHODS: Consecutive patients aged < 65 years (n = 653) vs 65 years (n = 213), who underwent catheter ablation of AF in the course of eight years, were compared. Ablation strategy and procedure endpoints were left at the operators discretion. RESULTS: The group of patients 65 years comprised more females (p < 0.001), and more frequently presented with persistent AF (p = 0.010). These patients less frequently underwent simple pulmonary vein isolation (p = 0.017); on the contrary, extensive ablation including coronary sinus intervention was more common (p = 0.020). There was no difference in repeat ablation procedures (25 % vs 26 % patients; p = 0.823, or 1.4 vs 1.5 ablation procedures/1 patients; p = 0.479, respectively). Spectrum of recurrent arrhythmias did not differ between the groups except for more frequent paroxysmal AF before the first repeat ablation in patients < 65 years (p = 0.050). At the end of 49 Â± 26 month total follow-up, stable sinus rhythm (SR) was achieved in 85 % patients < 65 years vs 76 % patients 65 years (p = 0.318). To maintain stable SR, older patients more often continued to take antiarrhythmic medication (p = 0.054). More serious complication occurred in 3.8 % of the patients 65 years vs 2.1 % of the patients < 65 years of age (p = 0.207). CONCLUSION: Patients 65 years of age achieved insignificantly worse long-term outcome after insignificantly fewer repeat ablation procedures, and with more frequent use of antiarrhythmic drugs. SR maintenance and risk of complications were, however, favorable.
