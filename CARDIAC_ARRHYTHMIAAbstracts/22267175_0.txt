The dose-limiting toxicity of doxorubicin is cardiotoxicosis. The authors of this report hypothesized that by using their institution's adopted guidelines (that involve prescreening echocardiography and electrocardiography), they would detect pre-existing cardiac abnormalities that preclude doxorubicin administration in <10% of dogs. Of 101 dogs, only 6 were excluded from doxorubicin administration based on electrocardiogram abnormalities, with a majority of those arrhythmias classified as ventricular premature contractions. One patient was excluded based on echocardiogram alone due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The incidence of cardiotoxicity in treated dogs was 8% (8/101). Additional pretreatment and ongoing studies are indicated to identify risk factors for cardiotoxicity.
