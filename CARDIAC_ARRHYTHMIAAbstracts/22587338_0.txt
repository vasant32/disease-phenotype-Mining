It is desirable to obtain the maximum assist without suction in ventricular assist devices (VADs). However, high driving power of a VAD may cause severe ventricle suction that can induce arrhythmia, hemolysis, and pump damage. In this report, an appropriate VAD driving level that maximizes the assist effect without severe systolic suction was explored. The target driving level was set at the boundary between low driving power without suction and high driving power with frequent suction. In the boundary range, intermittent mild suction may occur. Driving power was regulated by the suction occurrence. The normal-suction boundary control method was evaluated in a female goat implanted with an undulation pump ventricular assist device (UPVAD). The UPVAD was driven in a semipulsatile mode with heartbeat synchronization control. Systolic driving power was adjusted using a normal-suction boundary control method developed for this study. We confirmed that driving power could be maintained in the boundary range. Occurrences of suction were evaluated using the suction ratio. We defined this ratio as the number of suction occurrences divided by the number of heartbeats. The suction ratio decreased by 70% when the normal-suction boundary control method was used.
