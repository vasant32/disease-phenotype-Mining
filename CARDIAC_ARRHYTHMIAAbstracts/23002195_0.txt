 AIMS: Implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) implantation is a class IIA recommendation for patients with cardiac sarcoidosis (CS). However, little is known about the efficacy and safety of ICDs in this population. The goal of this multicentre retrospective data review was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ICDs in patients with CS. METHODS AND RESULTS: Electrophysiologists at academic medical centres were asked to identify consecutive patients with CS and an ICD. Clinical information, ICD therapy history, and device complications were collected for each patient. Data were collected on 235 patients from 13 institutions, 64.7% male with mean age 55.6 ± 11.1. Over a mean follow-up of 4.2 ± 4.0 years, 85 of 234 (36.2%) patients received an appropriate ICD therapy (shocks and/or anti-tachycardia pacing) and 67 of 226 (29.7%) received an appropriate shock. Fifty-seven of 235 patients (24.3%) received a total of 222 inappropriate shocks. Forty-six adverse events occurred in 41 of 235 patients (17.4%). Patients who received appropriate ICD therapies were more likely to be male (73.8 vs. 59.6%, P = 0.0330), have a history of syncope (40.5 vs. 22.5%, P = 0.0044), lower left ventricular ejection fraction (38.1 ± 15.2 vs. 48.8 ± 14.7%, P ≤ 0.0001), ventricular pacing on baseline electrocardiogram (16.1 vs. 2.1%, P = 0.0002), and a secondary prevention indication (60.7 vs. 24.5%, P < 0.0001) compared with those who did not receive appropriate ICD therapies. CONCLUSION: Patients with CS and ICDs are at high risk for ventricular arrhythmias. This population also has high rates of inappropriate shocks and device complications.
