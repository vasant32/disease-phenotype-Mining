The QRS detection and segmentation processes constitute the first stages of a greater process, e.g., electrocardiogram (ECG) feature extraction. Their accuracy is a prerequisite to a satisfactory performance of the P and T wave segmentation, and also to the reliability of the heart rate variability analysis. This work presents an innovative approach of QRS detection and segmentation and the detailed results of the proposed algorithm based on First-Derivative, Hilbert and Wavelet Transforms, adaptive threshold and an approach of surface indicator. The method combines the adaptive threshold, Hilbert and Wavelet Transforms techniques, avoiding the whole ECG signal preprocessing. After each QRS detection, the computation of an indicator related to the area covered by the QRS complex envelope provides the detection of the QRS onset and offset. The QRS detection proposed technique is evaluated based on the well-known MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and QT databases, obtaining the average sensitivity of 99.15% and the positive predictability of 99.18% for the first database, and 99.75% and 99.65%, respectively, for the second one. The QRS segmentation approach is evaluated on the annotated QT database with the average segmentation errors of 2.85±9.90ms and 2.83±12.26ms for QRS onset and offset, respectively. Those results demonstrate the accuracy of the developed algorithm for a wide variety of QRS morphology and the adaptation of the algorithm parameters to the existing QRS morphological variations within a single record.
