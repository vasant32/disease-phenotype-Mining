Taurine-magnesium coordination compound (TMCC) has anti-arrhythmic effects. The aim of the present study was to explore the targets of the anti-arrhythmic effect of TMCC and the electrophysiological effects of TMCC on ouabain-induced arrhythmias in rat ventricular myocytes. Sodium current (I(Na)), L-type calcium current (I(ca, L)), and transient outward potassium current (I(to)) were measured and analyzed using whole-cell patch-clamp recording technique in normal rat cardiac myocytes and rat ventricular myocytes of arrhythmia induced by ouabain. In isolated ventricular myocytes, I(Na) and I(to) were blocked by TMCC (100, 200, 400 μM) in a concentration-dependent manner, and the effects of TMCC (400 μM) were equal to that of amiodarone. However, I (ca, L) was moderately increased by TMCC (400 μM) while significantly decreased by amiodarone. Ouabain (5 μM) significantly decreased sodium, L-type calcium, and transient outward potassium currents. TMCC (100 μM) relieved abnormal sodium currents induced by ouabain through facilitation of steady-state inactivation. TMCC (200 and 400 μM) relieved abnormal L-type calcium currents induced by ouabain through facilitation of steady-state activation and retardation of steady-state inactivation. TMCC failed to further inhibit abnormal transient outward potassium currents induced by ouabain. However, amiodarone inhibited the decreasing sodium, L-type calcium, and transient outward potassium currents further. These data suggest that I(Na), I(ca, L), and I(to) may be the targets of the antiarrhythmic effect of TMCC, which can antagonize ouabain-induced changes of ionic currents in rat ventricular myocytes.
