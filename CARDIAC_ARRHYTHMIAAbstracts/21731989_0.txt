Regular broad QRS complex tachycardias may be ventricular in origin or due to supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy. Antidromic atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia occurring in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is a third possibility. The electrocardiogram is a key tool for distinguishing these tachycardias, which have differing causes, prognoses and treatment strategies. Ventricular tachycardia may be monomorphic or polymorphic. The management of ventricular tachycardia depends on clinical symptoms and is influenced by the presence of structural heart disease.
