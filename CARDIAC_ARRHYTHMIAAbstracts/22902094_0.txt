Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are highly effective in reducing mortality related to ventricular arrhythmias. However, there is considerable morbidity associated with their use, mostly related to ICD shocks. In addition, the occurrence of arrhythmias and ICD shocks in patients with heart failure is associated with an adverse prognosis. Strategies to reduce or prevent ventricular arrhythmias and shocks are a prime area of focus and development in patients with ICDs.
