 PURPOSE: There is an increasing need for catheter ablation procedures to treat complex atrial tachycardias (AT) and atrial fibrillation (AF), often requiring detailed endocardial mapping. The sequential point-to-point contact mapping of complex arrhythmias is time-consuming and may not always be feasible. We assessed the utility of a novel spiral duo-decapolar high-density (HD) mapping catheter to delineate complex arrhythmia substrates for ablation. METHODS: The patients underwent HD mapping using a spiral catheter (AFocusII) and the EnSite NavX system, during catheter ablation procedures, to treat atrial arrhythmias. RESULTS: In 26 patients, a total of 32 atrial arrhythmias were mapped and ablated, comprising of five focal AT, eight macroreentrant AT, 11 persistent AF and eight paroxysmal AF. The HD catheter was used to acquire endocardial surface geometries in all cases and to map the pulmonary veins in patients undergoing AF ablation. In persistent AF, HD catheter mapping permitted the creation of highly detailed complex fractionated electrogram maps (left atrium 449 ± 128 points in 7.2 ± 2.6 min; right atrium 411 ± 113 points in 6.7 ± 1.6 min). In AT, activation mapping was performed with the acquisition of 305 ± 158 timing points in 7.3 ± 2.6 min, guiding successful ablation in all cases. During the follow-up of 7.0 ± 2.6 months, all AT patients remained free of significant arrhythmia. CONCLUSIONS: High-density contact mapping with a novel spiral multipolar catheter allows rapid assessment of focal and macroreentrant AT, and complex fractionated electrical activity in the atria. It has further multi-functional capabilities as a pulmonary vein mapping catheter and for accurate geometry creation when used with a 3D mapping system.
