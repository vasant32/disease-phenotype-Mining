Chloroform, a halogenated hydrocarbon, causes central nervous system (CNS) depression, cardiac arrhythmias, hepatotoxicity, and renal failure. We describe a successful outcome in a case of chloroform ingestion with renal and hepatotoxicity with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administration and hemodialysis support.
