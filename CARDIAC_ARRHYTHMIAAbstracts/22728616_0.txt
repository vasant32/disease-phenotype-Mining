We report a fatal case of fulminant myocarditis (FM) in a five-year-old male child. He presented to our Emergency Department having complained fever, vomiting, nausea and abdominal pain from the previous day. The ECG showed broad complex tachycardia unresponsive to treatment with both drugs and all other resuscitation measures and the child died four hours after admission. Post-mortem histological examination showed diffuse infiltration of the myocardium although no viral material could be identified. FM is relatively uncommon and late presentation at an almost irreversible stage unusual. This case indicates the necessity of a rapid transfer to a center with ECMO or MCS, when FM is diagnosed.
