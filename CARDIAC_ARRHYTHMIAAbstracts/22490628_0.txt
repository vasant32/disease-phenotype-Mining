 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of admission heart rate (HR) on 30-day all-cause death and cardiovascular events in Chinese patients with ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI). METHODS: A total of 7485 Chinese STEMI patients from a global randomized controlled trial (CREATE) database were divided into six groups by admission HR: < 60, 60 - 69, 70 - 79, 80 - 89, 90 - 99 and ≥ 100 bpm. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause death; the secondary outcomes were the composite of 30-day all-cause death, reinfarction, cardiogenic shock or deadly arrhythmia. RESULTS: Admission glucose level, proportion of female gender, incidence of anterior myocardial infarction, previous diabetes mellitus, hypertension and Killip level II-IV were significantly higher in patients with admission HR ≥ 90 bpm compared to 60 - 69 bpm group (P < 0.05). The 30-day mortality was lowest (6.3%) in the 60 - 69 bpm group and was 9.6% in HR < 60 bpm group (P < 0.05 vs. 60 - 69 bpm group). In patients with admission HR > 60 bpm, the 30-day mortality increased in proportion to higher admission HR: 8.1% in 70 - 79 bpm, 9.2% in 80 - 89 bpm, 12.6% in 90 - 99 bpm and 24.6% in ≥ 100 bpm groups (all P < 0.05 vs. 60 - 69 bpm group). The incidence of MACE was similar as that of 30-day mortality: 27.0% in < 60 bpm, 12.5% in 60 - 69 bpm, 13.7% in 70 - 79 bpm, 14.3% in 80 - 89 bpm, 17.5% in 90 - 99 bpm and 31.1% in ≥ 100 bpm groups. Multivariate analysis showed that the incidence of 30-day mortality positively correlated with the admission HR (P < 0.05) except in the patients with admission HR < 60 bpm (OR = 0.832, P = 0.299), the risk of joint endpoint events was higher in the patients with HR < 60 bpm (OR = 1.532, 95%CI: 1.201 - 1.954, P < 0.05), 90 - 99 bpm (OR = 1.436, 95%CI: 1.091 - 1.889, P < 0.05) or ≥ 100 bpm (OR = 1.893, 95%CI: 1.471 - 2.436, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Admission HR is an independent risk factor for short-term outcome in Chinese STEMI patients.
