Patients on a telemetry unit experienced an increase in thrombophlebitis in 2004. The purpose of this research was to determine if peripheral IV amiodarone and vancomycin influenced the incidence of thrombophlebitis in an adult cardiothoracic population. Amiodarone phlebitis rates range up to 27%. In December 2004, Pharmacy diluted the amiodarone concentration to 600 mg/500 ml. By 2005, data demonstrated a consistent decrease in the incidence of thrombophlebitis. However, related to institutional policies and patient safety concerns, the amiodarone infusion concentration was reversed back to 900 mg/500 ml in October 2005. Thrombophlebitis increased after the return to a more concentrated amiodarone IV solution. Vancomycin infusion administration did not change during this time period. A retrospective chart review and observational, before and after study, demonstrated a correlation between amiodarone concentration and the incidence of thrombophlebitis. Vancomycin infusions appeared to prevent peripheral thrombophlebitis in the study population. Data was compelling and resulted in the institution standardizing the more dilute amiodarone IV concentration.
