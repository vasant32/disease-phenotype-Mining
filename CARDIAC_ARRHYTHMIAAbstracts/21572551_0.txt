Pathophysiological remodeling of cardiac function occurs at multiple levels, spanning the spectrum from molecular and sub-cellular changes to those occurring at the organ-system levels. Of key importance to arrhythmias are changes in electrophysiological and calcium handling properties at the tissue level. In this review, we discuss how high-resolution optical action potential and calcium transient imaging has advanced our understanding of basic arrhythmia mechanisms associated with multiple cardiovascular disorders, including the long QT syndrome, heart failure, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. We focus on the role of repolarization gradients (section 1) and calcium mediated triggers (section 2) in the initiation and maintenance of complex arrhythmias in these settings.
