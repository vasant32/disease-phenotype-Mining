 AIMS: The prognostic significance of ventricular tachycardia (VT) induced by three extrastimuli (ES) is similar to that of VT induced by one or two ES in patients with coronary disease and abnormal left ventricular (LV) function. The significance of VT inducible with four ES is unclear. To examine the prognostic significance of VT inducible with the fourth ES in patients with post-myocardial infarct (MI) LV dysfunction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive patients (n= 432) with post-MI LV ejection fraction ≤40% underwent electrophysiological (EP) studies for risk stratification. Inducible VT ≥ 200 ms cycle length (CL) with one to four ES was considered inducible. The primary endpoint of arrhythmia (sudden death or spontaneous VT/ventricular fibrillation) was compared among patients with VT inducible with less than or equal to two, three, and four ES. The incidence of inducible VT was 37.9% (n= 164). In patients with inducible VT, inducibility was with less than or equal to two, three, and four ES in 24% (n= 39), 46% (n= 75), and 30% (n= 50). Compared to VT induced with less than or equal to three ES, VT induced with the fourth ES was of shorter CL (218 vs. 256 ms, P = 0.01) and more likely to be haemodynamically unstable requiring cardioversion (77 vs. 55%, P = 0.05). After 3 years the primary endpoint occurred in 28 ± 8, 28 ± 6, and 18 ± 6% in patients with VT induced with less than or equal to two, three, and four ES, respectively (P= 0.31) and in 5 ± 2% of EP-negative patients (P< 0.01). CONCLUSION: In patients with post-MI LV dysfunction, VT can be induced in a significant proportion of patients with the fourth ES. These patients are at comparable risk of arrhythmia to patients with inducible VT with less than or equal to three ES.
