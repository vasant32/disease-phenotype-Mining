Daurisoline (1) is a bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloid isolated from the rhizomes of Menispermum dauricum. The antiarrhythmic effect of 1 has been demonstrated in different experimental animals. In previous studies, daurisoline (1) prolonged action potential duration (APD) in a normal use-dependent manner. However, the electrophysiological mechanisms for 1-induced prolongation of APD have not been documented. In the present study, the direct effect of 1 was investigated on the hERG current and the expression of mRNA and protein in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells stably expressing the hERG channel. It was shown that 1 inhibits hERG current in a concentration- and voltage-dependent manner. In the presence of 10 μM 1, steady-state inactivation of V(1/2) was shifted negatively by 15.9 mV, and 1 accelerated the onset of inactivation. Blockade of hERG channels was dependent on channel opening. The expression and function of hERG were unchanged by 1 at 1 and 10 μM, while hERG expression and the hERG current were decreased significantly by 1 at 30 μM. These results indicate that 1, at concentrations below 30 μM, exerts a blocking effect on hERG, but does not affect the expression and function of the hERG channel. This may explain the relatively lower risk of long QT syndrome after long-term usage.
