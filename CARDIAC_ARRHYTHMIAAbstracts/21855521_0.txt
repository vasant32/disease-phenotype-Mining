 BACKGROUND: A high incidence of early repolarization (ER) pattern in the inferolateral leads has been reported in patients with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF). Brugada syndrome (BS) is characterized by J-point or ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads and ventricular fibrillation, and some patients with BS also have ER in the inferolateral leads. OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical characteristics and effects of sodium-channel blockade on ER between IVF patients with ER (early repolarization syndrome [ERS]) and BS patients with or without ER. METHODS: Fourteen patients with ERS and 21 patients with BS were included in this study. ER was defined as an elevation of at least 0.1 mV from baseline in the QRS-T junction in the inferorolateral leads. Provocative tests with sodium-channel blockers were conducted in all patients with ERS to distinguish ERS from BS. RESULTS: In the ERS group, all patients were male and most patients experienced ventricular fibrillation during sleep or low activity (79%). ER was attenuated by sodium-channel blockers in most patients with ERS (13/14, 93%) and BS (5/5, 100%), whereas ST-segment elevation was augmented in the right precordial leads in the BS group. The rates of positive late potentials were significantly higher in the BS group (60%) than in the ERS group (7%) (P <.01). CONCLUSIONS: Some similarities were observed between ERS and BS, including gender, arrhythmia triggers, and response of ER to sodium-channel blockers. Unlike the ST segment in the right precordial leads in BS, ER was attenuated in patients with both ERS and BS, suggesting a differential mechanism between ER in the inferolateral leads and ST elevation in the right precordial leads.
