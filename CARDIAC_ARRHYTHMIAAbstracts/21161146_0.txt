Hypokalemia is a common finding. The clinical presentation can be paralyses and cardiac arrhythmias. We present a normotensive young woman with salt appetite, cramps and palpitations. In our case report the patient shows a positive family history for hypopotassemia, a metabolic alkalosis with hypotension, and hypocalciuria with an increased urinary potassium loss. The levels of renin and aldosterone were elevated. After a negative testing for metabolites of diuretics, we obtained a positive result of the suspected SLC12A3 genetic test. This mutation leads to a failure of the thiazide-sensitive sodium-2-chloride-cotransporter, the so called Gitelman syndrome, which presents similar to a chronic thiazide therapy. The Gitelman syndrome is a rare disease with renal potassium loss and hypotension. Especially in young patients around the age of twenty or in patients with chronic intractable hypopotassemia a Gitelman syndrome should be considered.
