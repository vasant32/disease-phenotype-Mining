 PURPOSE: An electroanatomic mapping system using an electromagnetic navigation technology constructs a 3-dimensional structure of the heart with high geometric accuracy of the data that provides a precise localization of the substrates of arrhythmias. The system was tested for the feasibility and efficacy in intraoperative mapping. DESCRIPTION: The strength of the magnetic field is measured by a location sensor with three different frequencies generated by a location pad placed beneath the operating table, and the spatial location of the sensor is determined. By roving the catheter on the heart while the local electrogram is recorded simultaneously, the 3-dimensional figure of the heart is reconstructed and an activation or voltage map is generated. EVALUATION: The system was used in 19 patients with ventricular tachycardia or other arrhythmias. The focus or reentrant circuit of the tachycardia was precisely located and a map-guided procedure was successfully performed in all patients. Cardiopulmonary bypass allowed for the tachycardias to be mapped without any hemodynamic compromise. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative mapping using the electroanatomic mapping system enables a precise localization of the tachycardia substrate.
