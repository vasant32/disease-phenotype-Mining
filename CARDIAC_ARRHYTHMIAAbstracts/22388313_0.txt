Simultaneous occlusion of multiple epicardial coronary arteries is an uncommon finding in patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). We describe a 41- year-old male Asian patient who presented with inferior and anterior STEMI complicated by cardiogenic shock and frequent life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. The patient was subsequently found to have acute occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery (RCA) and proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). The patient was treated with primary percutaneous coronary interventions for RCA and LAD, and intra-aortic balloon pump placement showed excellent results. Based on the available literature, early PCI for this very rare condition is paramount for patient survival.
