Three patients with poor left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction <30 %) developed postoperative atrial tachyarrhythmia in intensive care. Case 1 was a 64-year-old man who underwent a modified Bentall procedure and mitral valve annuloplasty. Case 2 was a 63-year-old woman who underwent quintuple coronary artery bypass grafting. Case 3 was a 65-year-old man who underwent mitral valve replacement. Preoperative intra-aortic balloon pumping was required in Cases 2 and 3. Excellent heart rate control with no hemodynamic deterioration was achieved in all three cases by very-low-dose continuous drip infusion of landiolol hydrochloride (2-5 Î¼g/kg/min). Very-low-dose continuous drip infusion of landiolol hydrochloride is a safe and useful alternative for the control of perioperative atrial tachyarrhythmias in patients with poor left ventricular function.
