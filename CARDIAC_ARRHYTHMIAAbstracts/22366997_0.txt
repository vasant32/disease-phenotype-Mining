 INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to determine the effects of isoproterenol infusion on level of consciousness during ablation using total intravenous anesthesia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seven patients undergoing total intravenous anesthesia for atrial fibrillation ablation were monitored for level of consciousness using bispectral EEG levels (BIS). Isoproterenol infusion was performed after the ablation during anesthesia. BIS levels prior to, during, and post-isoproterenol infusion were recorded and correlated to isoproterenol infusion doses. In all patients, BIS levels significantly increased during isoproterenol infusion (median BIS prior to infusion, 46; during infusion, 64 (p < 0.02)). With a subsequent increase in anesthetic medication, BIS levels could again be reduced. CONCLUSION: Isoproterenol infusion alters consciousness level during total intravenous anesthesia for atrial fibrillation ablation. BIS monitoring is a novel way to modulate anesthesia during ablation to potentially optimize patient comfort and ablation success.
