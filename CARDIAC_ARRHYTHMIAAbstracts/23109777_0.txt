We present the case of a 55-year-old woman with giant cell myocarditis who experienced a rapid deterioration in her condition. As her heart failure progressed, she developed more ventricular ectopic beats, which culminated in a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that did not improve despite immunosuppressive and antiarrhythmic therapy. Emergent biventricular assist device placement, however, did eliminate her arrhythmia.
