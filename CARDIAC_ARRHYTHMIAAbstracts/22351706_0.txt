Although indications for a Fontan procedure have broadened, some patients, in the past, were ineligible for the Fontan completion after a Glenn procedure and thus suffered the limitations of the Glenn procedure-namely desaturation, arrhythmia and reduced quality of life. If examined more closely, however, completion may yet be feasible for such patients. We present here a complex case of asplenia, dextrocardia and total anomalous pulmonary venous return (1b) where the Fontan procedure was successfully completed 12 years after the Glenn procedure. A unique surgical strategy incorporating intra-atrial total cavopulmonary connection and atrioventricular valve repair contributed to our success.
