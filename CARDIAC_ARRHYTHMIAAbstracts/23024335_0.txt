 AIMS: In order to improve the abysmal outcome of dialysis patients, it is critical to identify patients with a high mortality risk. The spatial QRS-T angle, which can be easily calculated from the 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG), might be useful in the prognostication in dialysis patients. The objective of this study was to establish the prognostic value of the spatial QRS-T angle. METHODS AND RESULTS: All patients who initiated dialysis therapy between 2002 and 2009 in the hospitals of Leiden (LUMC) and Amsterdam (AMC) at least 3 months on dialysis were included. The spatial QRS-T angle was calculated, from a routinely acquired ECG, and its relationship with mortality was assessed. An abnormal spatial QRS-T angle was defined as ≥ 130° in men and ≥ 116° in women. In total, 277 consecutive patients (172 male, mean age 56.3 ± 17.0) were included. An abnormal spatial QRS-T angle was associated with a higher risk of death from all causes [hazard ratio (HR) 2.33; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.46-3.70] and especially a higher risk of sudden cardiac death (HR 2.99; 95% CI 1.04-8.60). Furthermore, an abnormal spatial QRS-T angle was of incremental prognostic value, when added to a risk model consisting of known risk factors. CONCLUSION: In chronic dialysis patients the spatial QRS-T angle is a significant and independent predictor of all-cause and especially sudden cardiac death. It implies that this parameter can be used to identify high risk patients.
