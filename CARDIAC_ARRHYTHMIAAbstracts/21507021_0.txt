Congenitally corrected transposition of the great vessels (CCTGV) is a rare congenital heart defect associated with multiple cardiac morphological abnormalities and conduction defects. Complete atrioventricular (AV) block occurs in 30% of patients and it may be present at birth or develop later with a rate of 2% per year; moreover, a systemic right ventricle is frequently characterized by heart failure in adult life. We used a bifocal cardiac stimulation for a young woman affected by CCTGV and atrioventricular Mobitz 2 and 2:1 block, considering structural, anatomic condition, and the high rate of pacing she underwent.
