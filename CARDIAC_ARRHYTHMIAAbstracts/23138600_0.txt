 AIM: Totally percutaneous endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (PEVAR) by using the "Preclose" technique has been previously described. We retrospectively analyzed data, collected prospectively at our institution, regarding PEVAR via femoral artery access with local anesthesia and conscious sedation. METHODS: Between January 2001 and May 2009, 1150 patients underwent PEVAR in the endovascular suite of the cardiac catheterization laboratory at our institution. Of those procedures, 915 (79%) were performed with local anesthesia and conscious sedation. RESULTS: The majority of patients were male (87%). Their mean age was 72±10 years, and 98% had a risk status of American Society of Anesthesiologists class III or IV. The PEVAR involved bilateral percutaneous femoral access with 12F to 24F sheaths (depending on the stent-graft system). The mean total procedure time was 149 minutes. Percutaneous closure of the arterial access sites with the Prostar XL was successful in 1727 (94.3%) of the 1830 femoral arteries in which PEVAR was attempted, whereas 103 femoral arteries (5.6%) required surgical repair because adequate hemostasis was not attained at the access site. There were no procedural deaths, but 6 patients (0.6%) died within 30 days of the procedure: 3 died of intestinal ischemia, 1 of stroke, 1 of refractory ventricular arrhythmia, and 1 of worsening renal failure. Mean length of hospital stay was 1.3±2 days. CONCLUSION: PEVAR with local anesthesia and intravenous sedation is safe and feasible and should be considered for patients for whom general anesthesia poses a high risk.
