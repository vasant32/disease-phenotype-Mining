A QRS complex detection algorithm based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and adaptive windowing technique is proposed in this paper. In this algorithm we mainly used Hilbert-Huang transform to propose EMD method suitable for QRS complex detection, with which the 30th signal in sddb database and the 208th signal in mit-db database could be processed, and then obtained R wave detection results. At the same time, Q and S points' detection technique was analyzed with adaptive windowing technique. The detection results, through proceeding R wave detection on part data of MIT/BIT arrhythmia database, showed that the proposed algorithm in this paper had a very good detection effect, and that its average correct detection rate of R wave reached 99.62%, its average sensitivity of QRS complex was 98.91%, and the corresponding average specificity was 99.35%.
