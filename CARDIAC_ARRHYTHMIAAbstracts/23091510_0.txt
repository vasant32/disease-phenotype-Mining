Herein, we present a case of a successful catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) using a radial artery approach in a post-myocardial infarction patient, who had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and peripheral artery disease. Although the patient did not use antiarrhythmic drugs, the patient experienced no recurrence of VT during the following 3-year period.
