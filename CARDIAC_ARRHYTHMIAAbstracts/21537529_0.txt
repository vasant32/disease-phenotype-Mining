 BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation with tissue ablation device through bipolar radiofrequency in conjunction with cardiac surgery has proven to be an effective method to treat this arrhythmia. OBJECTIVE: Describe the initial experience of the Instituto Nacional de Cardiologia in the surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation using bipolar radiofrequency device in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, reporting the results of postoperative follow-up of one year. METHODS: Between January 2008 and March 2009, 47 consecutive patients (36 women), with mean age of 53.7 Â± 10.6 years, with atrial fibrillation for a mean period of 34.6 months (3-192 months) underwent surgical ablation of this arrhythmia, through bipolar radiofrequency during the procedure which led to the indication of surgery. Eight of them showed intermittent atrial fibrillation and 39, continued. Eighty-one percent underwent valve surgery as the main procedure. This is a one-year postoperative retrospective, observational evaluation of clinical variables and 24-h Holter. RESULTS: Out of the 47 patients, 40 survived one year. Out of these, 33 underwent 24 h Holter, at an average interval of 401 days after the surgery. The following rhythm distribution was found: 24 (73.0%) sinus, five (15.0%) atrial fibrillation, three (9.0%) atrial Flutter and one (3.0%) junctional rhythm. Two cerebrovascular accidents were observed, one of which was associated with supraventricular arrhythmia. CONCLUSION: Surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation with bipolar radiofrequency device concomitant with cardiac surgery is an effective method for treating this arrhythmia.
