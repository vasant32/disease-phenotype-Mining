 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a protocol based on European guidelines for the management and diagnosis of syncope applied by a multidisciplinary team in unselected patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 402 unselected patients were followed prospectively in a second-level country hospital, between November 2003 and November 2008 with a protocol based on European Guidelines. RESULT: Syncope was diagnosed in 83.3% of patients and 26.6% required hospitalization. For every 100 cases, the number of tests carried out and their performance (percentage of positive diagnostic tests/number of tests carried out) was calculated. Tilt test: 31 and performance: 62.4%, Doppler-echocardiography. 17-8.3%, Holter 16-13.2%, cranial CT 5.2-0%, ergometry 1.9-0%, chest CT 1.4-16%, EPS 1.2-33%, ILR 0.7-33%. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a high percentage of diagnoses with low number of tests carried out, emphasizing the performance of tilt test. The study of unselected patients with a protocol based on European Guidelines for the management and diagnosis of syncope applied by a multidisciplinary team was very effective.
