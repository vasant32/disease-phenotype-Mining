 UNLABELLED: Direct current cardioversion is effective in arrhythmias' termination. Few is known about its use in our practice. This work aims to report its outcomes over a ten-year period in Abidjan. METHOD: One thousand, three hundred and ninety one charts of arrhythmic patients were reviewed. RESULTS: Cardioversion was attempted in 102 patients. One hundred and eighty one shocks were delivered with a mean energy of 262, 1 joules. Success occurred in 84 patients (82,3%). Cardioversion failed in 18 patients mostly in atrial fibrillation. Eight serious complications (7,8%) occurred including 1 sinus node dysfunction, 1 pulmonary oedema, 1 metrorrhagia, 2 stroke, 1 pulmonary embolism. Two patients with ventricular tachycardia died of end-stage heart failure and aftermath of a mitral valve surgery. CONCLUSION: Direct current cardioversion is effective and safe in our practice. Complications are predominantly due to the medical environment such as antiarrhythmic drugs use or clinical conditions.
