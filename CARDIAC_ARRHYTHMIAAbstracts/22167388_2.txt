We performed a survey on current practice of ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators among the European Heart Rhythm Association Research Network. The main indication for the procedure is the occurrence of multiple shocks or electrical storm, while prophylactic ablation is only rarely performed. The epicardial approach is seldom used and mostly only after failure of endocardial ablation. The main ablation strategy is targeting the clinical VT only by substrate mapping and ablation, and by targeting fractionated potentials with utilization of modern electroanatomical mapping systems. Still, a considerable number of centres frequently perform the procedure using conventional mapping catheters only.
