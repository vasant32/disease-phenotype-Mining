 BACKGROUND: We studied low-dose human atrial natriuretic peptide (hANP) infusion therapy during cardiac surgery and reported the cardiac and renal protective effects. The efficacy of a bolus injection of hANP (the "hANP shot") simultaneously with induction of cardioplegia has been proven in animal experiments. In the present study the clinical effects of this "hANP shot" were examined. METHODS AND RESULTS: The subjects were 67 patients undergoing Coronary artery bypass grafting. At the time of inducing cardioplegia, 1 group received a simultaneous bolus injection of 100 Î¼g of hANP (hANP group) and the other group received an injection of physiological saline (placebo group). The primary endpoints were (1) operative mortality and complications, and (2) the creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CPK-MB), troponin-I, and human heart fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) levels. The secondary endpoints were (1) the incidence of arrhythmia, and levels of (2) atrial and B-type natriuretic peptides, and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), and (3) renin, angiotensin II, and aldosterone. Postoperative CPK-MB, troponin-I, and H-FABP levels were significantly lower in the hANP group than in the placebo group. Postoperative arrhythmia was significantly less frequent in the hANP group than in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to achieve cardioprotective effects based on the safety of the "hANP shot", as well as from biomarkers of ischemia and results related to arrhythmia. The "hANP shot" should also be evaluated as a safer and new cardioprotective method for cardiac surgery.
