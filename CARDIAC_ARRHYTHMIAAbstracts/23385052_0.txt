AIMS: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) improves symptoms and reduces mortality in heart failure (HF) patients, but little data exist on the efficacy of CRT in the elderly. The aim of our study is to define CRT-related benefits in terms of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) improvement in two subgroups of patients (<75 and ≥75 years old) and test possible differences between these two groups.METHODS AND RESULTS: Single-centre prospective observational study including 65 patients with optimally treated, advanced HF and indication to CRT. All patients were investigated with clinical evaluation, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ), 12-lead electrocardiogram, and full echocardiographical study before CRT implant and 3 and 12 months after. Left ventricular ejection fraction showed a time-related improvement in the whole population (+10.6% over 12 months) as well as in each subgroup. The magnitude of LVEF improvement was similar in elderly and non-elderly patients (+13.6 vs. +7.9%; P = ns). Left ventricular diameters, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, New York Heart Association class, MLHFQ score, and QRS width all showed a time-related improvement in the whole population as well as in each subgroup. End-diastolic left ventricular diameter remodelling and QRS width reduction were significantly more pronounced in the elderly, whereas other clinical and instrumental secondary endpoints showed a similar improvement between ≥75 and <75 years old patients. There was no significant difference regarding mortality between elderly and non-elderly patients.CONCLUSION: Cardiac resynchronization therapy is as effective in improving LVEF in elderly as in non-elderly patients. Age alone should not be a determinant to restrict resynchronization therapy in HF patients.
