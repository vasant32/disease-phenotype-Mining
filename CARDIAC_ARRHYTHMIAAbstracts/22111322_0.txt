Hypertension facilitates development and progression of cardiac diseases such as left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), coronary artery disease (CAD), arrhythmia and heart failure. Strict blood pressure control over 24 hours is essential for the primary and secondary prevention of these cardiac diseases. Inhibitors of renin-angiotensin system(RASI) such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers(ARB) and long-acting calcium channel blockers(CCB) are effective in improving LVH. CCB and beta-blockers are preferentially chosen for CAD. RASI is expected to reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation. RASI, beta-blockers and aldosterone blockers have been shown to improve the prognosis of heart failure patients. In addition, diuretics and long-acting CCB are used for the adequate control of body fluid volume and blood pressure.
