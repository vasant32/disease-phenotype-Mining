 AIMS: A considerable number of lead defects occurs during long-term cardioverter defibrillator therapy. Evidence-based strategies for the handling of chronically implanted, non-functional high-voltage (HV) leads are mandatory. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patient outcome after abandonment of HV leads was retrospectively compared with patient outcome following other lead revision strategies and following primary implantation. A total of 903 consecutive patients undergoing 997 implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantations or lead revisions were followed for a mean period of 48.8 Â± 37.8 months. One or more additional HV leads were placed in 60 patients. An additional pace/sense lead was implanted in 13 patients. Extraction and replacement of a dysfunctional HV lead was performed in 21 patients. The overall rate of complications including artefact sensing, ineffective defibrillation, symptomatic subclavian vein thrombosis, and other lead defects did not differ between patients with and without an additional HV lead (10.0 vs. 8.9%, P = 0.32). Survival without lead associated complications did not differ between groups. Results remained unchanged after correction for covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Abandoned HV leads did not increase the risk of ICD system-related complications in the majority of patients. Thus, a general lead extraction policy of dysfunctional HV leads cannot be advised in an average ICD population. Recommendations may not apply for young and physically active patients, in whom HV lead extraction must be considered.
