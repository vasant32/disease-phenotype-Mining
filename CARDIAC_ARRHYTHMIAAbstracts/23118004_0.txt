 AIMS: Insulation breaches with externalization of conductor cables have been described for St-Jude Medical Riata™ defibrillation leads. Published data on the incidence of Riata lead abnormalities are quite heterogeneous. The objective of this study was to estimate systematically the prevalence of lead abnormalities using a postero-anterior (PA) and lateral chest X-ray (CXR). METHODS AND RESULTS: From 2002 to 2008, 552 Riata defibrillation leads were implanted at our centre. We evaluated patients for potential insulation breaches. A PA and lateral CXR was obtained. Chest X-rays were reviewed by two electrophysiologists using a zooming function with magnification up to factor 7.5 and were classified as normal or abnormal for the presence of conductor externalization. A total of 284 patients were included. Riata lead models were 1570, 1580, 1582, 1590, 1592, 7000, 7002, and 7022. The total frequency of radiological lead defects was 24.3%. Insulation breaches occurred at zones of major lead curvature. Mean maximal spacing between extruding lead components was 3.6 ± 1.9 mm (range 2.0-12.4). Abnormal CXRs were more frequent in 8F leads (31.4% vs. 6.3%; P < 0.001). Most defects occurred with lead models 1582 (41.2%) and 1580 (31.4%). Mean time since implantation was longer in abnormal leads (6.7 vs. 5.9 years; P < 0.001). Abnormal leads had higher pacing thresholds (1.1 ± 0.8 V vs. 0.9 ± 0.4 V; P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The incidence of insulation breach in Riata leads is much higher than quoted by the manufacturer or reported by most of the literature. A PA and lateral CXR with zooming appears adequate to identify lead breaches when reviewed by an electrophysiologist. Riata lead breaches without electrical abnormalities present a management dilemma and will require further studies.
