Dyssynchrony is common in asymptomatic patients with hypertension. We sought to investigate the impact of antihypertensive treatment on dyssynchrony in patients with hypertension. A total of sixty patients who had uncomplicated hypertension that had never been treated (treatment-naïve hypertensive patients) underwent echocardiographic evaluations of left ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony at baseline and after a 6-month treatment with antihypertensive drugs. The measured parameters were as follows: (1) the s.d. of 12 LV-segment time-to-peak systolic velocities (Ts-SD12), and (2) the maximal difference between peak systolic velocities of any 2 of the 12 segments (Ts-Max). Patients with Ts-SD12 ≥ 33 ms or Ts-Max ≥ 100 ms were regarded as having LV systolic dyssynchrony. Patients with systolic dyssynchrony (group 1, n = 29) and without systolic dyssynchrony (group 2, n = 31) were compared. Among the patients in group 1, antihypertensive treatment significantly improved LV systolic dyssynchrony (ΔTs-SD12, -13.1 ms; P<0.001 and ΔTs-Max, -34.0 ms; P = 0.003), whereas it did not demonstrate additional benefit among group 2 patients. The change in LV systolic dyssynchrony was significantly associated with changes in the mean annulus E' velocity, mean annulus S' velocity and mean annulus E'/A' ratio, but not with changes in blood pressure and LV mass index. It is likely that chronic antihypertensive treatment could reverse the LV systolic dyssynchrony and simultaneously improve subclinical systolic and diastolic function in patients with hypertension and LV systolic dyssynchrony.
