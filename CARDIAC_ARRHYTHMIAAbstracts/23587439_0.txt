Brugada syndrome (BrS) is associated with increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. Some drugs can trigger the electrocardiographic and arrhythmic manifestations of this syndrome. Cold medicines for symptom relief are sold without prescription in Brazil and most contain antihistamines and adrenergic agonists. We report a case of BrS probably triggered by the use of such medication.
