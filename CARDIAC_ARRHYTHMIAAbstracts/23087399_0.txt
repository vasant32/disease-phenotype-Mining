 BACKGROUND: Catheter-tissue contact is critical for effective lesion creation. We characterized the contact force (CF) at different anatomic sites during antral pulmonary vein (PV) isolation for atrial fibrillation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two experienced operators performed PV isolation in 22 patients facilitated by a novel CF-sensing ablation catheter in a blinded fashion. Average CF and force-time integral data from 1602 lesions were analyzed. The left and right PV antra were divided into the following: carina, superior, inferior, anterior, and posterior quadrants for analysis. There was significant variability in CF within and between different PV quadrants (P<0.05). Lowest CF of all left PV sites was at the carina and anterior quadrant, whereas highest CF was at the superior and inferior quadrants (P<0.05). Lowest CF of all right PV sites was at the carina, whereas highest CF was at the anterior and inferior quadrants (P<0.05). When comparing similar PV quadrants on the left versus right (eg, left carina versus right carina), CF was always higher in the right PVs (P<0.05), except at the superior quadrant where CF was similar in the left and right PVs (P=0.19). There was no specific pattern of anatomic distribution of excess CF (P=0.39). CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring of catheter-tissue CF during PV isolation demonstrates significant variability in CF within and between different PV antral sites. Sites of lowest CF were the carina and anterior left PVs and the carina of the right PVs. This information may be important for improving ablation efficacy and clinical outcomes during PV isolation.
