Antiplatelet agents are administered in the treatment of a large number of adult diseases: coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, peripheral arterial disease, arrhythmias with their thromboembolic complications, primary and secondary prevention. In childhood however, the situation is substantially different. The lack of large interventional trials on the use of antiplatelet drugs in children, has led to greater uncertainty, and a less extensive use of these drugs, limited to fewer indications. The purpose of this article was to review the studies conducted to date on the use of antiplatelet agents in children. A concerted effort has been made to identify which are the shared therapeutic indications of this class of compounds, the recommended dose, the contraindications and the possible side effects. In brief, an attempt has been made to ascertain the interesting potential of these drugs which are so often neglected in children.
