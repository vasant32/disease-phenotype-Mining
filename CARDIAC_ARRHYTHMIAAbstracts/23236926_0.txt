This chapter describes anesthetic consideration in patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) based on electrophysiologic or pharmacological aspects. In the 2011 guidelines of the Japanese Circulation Society for non-pharmacotherapy of cardiac arrhythmias, catheter ablation is recommended as Class I therapeutic modality for the patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal AF. Catheter ablation of AF is an invasive and long-lasting procedure necessitating sedation during treatment. However, in the most of the patients, sedation or anesthesia is possibly performed by cardiologists using propofol, midazolam or dexmedetomidine. Deep sedation accompanies a high risk of ventilatory or circulatory derangement. Furthermore, life-threatening complications, such as cerebral infarction or cardiac tamponade, can occur during ablation. Patients with AF are increasing in number as a trend in the aging society, resulting in an increase in catheter ablation in high risk patients. To accomplish safe anesthetic management of the patients for catheter ablations, anesthesiologists are required to have fundamental knowledge and skill in the performance of the catheter ablation.
