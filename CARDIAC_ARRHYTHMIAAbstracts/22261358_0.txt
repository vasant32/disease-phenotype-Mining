 AIMS: The aim of this study was to report the short- and long-term results of slow pathway radiofrequency (RF) ablation in patients with atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) using a simplified approach (2 catheters and short applications of RF). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study that included consecutive patients with AVNRT. We used an anatomical approach with only 2 catheters. Decremental AV nodal conduction and atrial-His conduction interval jump were measured. To detect the onset of the QRS, we used surface lead II. During the stimulation protocol, we performed S2-QRS and S3-QRS measurements. An increase in the S3-QRS3 interval of 50 milliseconds or greater in response to a decrease in the S2-QRS2 coupling interval of 10 milliseconds was defined as a discontinuous AV nodal function curve and taken as evidence of dual antegrade AV pathways. Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia was demonstrated by the presence of dual AV nodal physiology, atrial echoes, and tachycardia induction with a 1:1 AV relationship and a VA interval of less than 70 milliseconds. Short RF applications (10-15 seconds) were delivered at an intermediate point between the posteroseptal and medioseptal regions of the Koch triangle. The applications were considered effective when junctional rhythm appeared. The end point was the demonstration of slow pathway modification without AVNRT induction. RESULTS: Three hundred forty-four patients (age, 49.22 ± 17.47 years; 254 were female) were included. Discontinuous AV nodal function curves were found in 271 patients (78.77%), and short-term success was achieved in all patients. The anterograde jump in AV nodal conduction was abolished after RF in 222 patients (81.91%), and discontinuous AV nodal conduction and single AV nodal echo beats persisted in 49 cases (18%). The mean number of RF application was 7.79 ± 2.23, the mean number of effective applications was 4.63 ± 0.62, and the mean RF application time was 54.92 ± 8.03 seconds. The total procedure and fluoroscopy time was 29.45 ± 9.6 and 10.87 ± 2.36 minutes, respectively. After the procedure, all patients were followed up for a mean of 46.44 ± 18.89 months, and 7 patients (2%) presented AVNRT recurrences. Complications were observed in 4 patients (1.16%); no permanent AV block was observed. CONCLUSION: In this study, slow pathway RF ablation using a simplified approach technique is an effective and safe approach for the treatment of AVNRT.
