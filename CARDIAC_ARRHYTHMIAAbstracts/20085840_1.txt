 BACKGROUND: Our previous study showed that pretreatment with noradrenaline via opening of the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel protects myocardium against ischemia/reperfusion injuries. We have hypothesized that production of nitric oxide (NO) and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in noradrenaline-induced cardioprotection in rat heart. METHODS: All anesthetized rats underwent 25 min of regional ischemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion. Animals were randomized to receive one of the following treatment: saline, noradrenaline (2 μg/kg, i.v.), noradrenaline plus prazosin (an α(1)-adrenoceptor blocker, 0.5mg/kg, i.v.), noradrenaline plus L-NAME (a nonspecific NOS inhibitor, 10mg/kg, i.v.), noradrenaline plus tempol (a membrane-permeable radical scavenger, 30 mg/kg, i.v.), Prazosin alone, only L-NAME and tempol alone. RESULTS: Infarct size (% of risk area) was reduced from 49.6 ± 2.4 in saline-control group to 18.2 ± 1.5 in noradrenaline preconditioned group. Administration of prazosin, L-NAME, or tempol prior to noradrenaline injection abolished the observed cardioprotection of noradrenaline (45.5 ± 3, 41.7 ± 4.5 and 38.7 ± 5.4, respectively) and restored infarct size to saline-control rats' level. Incidences and severity of ventricular arrhythmia during ischemia and early reperfusion significantly decreased in noradrenaline preconditioned group compared with saline-control group. This cardioprotective effect of noradrenaline against ventricular arrhythmia was abrogated by administration of prazosin, L-NAME, or tempol. CONCLUSION: Cardioprotection effect of the α(1)-adrenoceptor stimulation by noradrenaline was inhibited by L-NAME or tempol in anesthetized rat heart.
