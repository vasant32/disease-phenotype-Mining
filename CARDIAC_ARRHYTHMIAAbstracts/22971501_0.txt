 OBJECTIVE: This study compared the risk of clinically significant reflex bradycardia during anaesthesia with sevoflurane or desflurane in patients undergoing gastrectomy. METHODS: In this randomized prospective study, 100 patients undergoing gastrectomy were assigned to receive sevoflurane (n=50) or desflurane (n=50) anaesthesia. No anticholinergic prophylaxis was administered. Symptomatic reflex bradycardia was defined as a sudden decrease in heart rate to <50 beats/min, or a decrease to 50-59 beats/min if associated with a systolic arterial pressure of 70 mmHg in response to surgical manoeuvres. If reflex bradycardia developed, atropine or ephedrine were administered according to a predefined treatment protocol. RESULTS: Data from 85 patients were available for analysis. The proportion of patients with symptomatic reflex bradycardia in the sevoflurane and desflurane groups was similar (69.0% versus 55.8%, respectively) and both groups required a similar amount of atropine and/or ephedrine. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically significant reflex bradycardia occurred with a relatively high frequency during gastrectomy. Although desflurane is associated with sympathetic activation, it did not provide a protective effect against vagally mediated reflex bradycardia during gastrectomy compared with sevoflurane.
