A typical human heart infarction involves the loss of approximately 1 billion cardiomyocytes, therefore, many investigators have sought to identify endogenous or exogenous stem cells with the capacity to differentiate into committed cardiomyocytes and to repopulate lost myocardium. As a result of these efforts, dozens of stem cell types have been reported to have cardiac potential, including pluripotent embryonic stem cells and various adult stem cells from bone marrow, peripheral tissues, and the heart itself. However, despite encouraging results from more than 140 worldwide clinical trials, considerable disagreement exists regarding the longterm efficiency and even the reality of cardiac differentiation by many of these stem cell types, making these issues a continuing source of controversy in the field of stem cell therapy. For donor cell types already in clinical studies, the predominant in vivo effect of bone marrow or endothelial progenitor cells may be on neoangiogenesis and not cardiac specification. Moreover skeletal myoblasts, despite integration and survival, are confounded by arrhythmia, perhaps reflecting lack of transdifferentiation. These obstacles underscore the need to seek cardiac progenitor cells beyond the few known sources, but so far the optimal choice of donor cell is still under intensive research.
