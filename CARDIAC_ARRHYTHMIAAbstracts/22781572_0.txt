 OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy and safety of radiofrequency catheter ablation (RCA) for ventricular premature beats originating from left coronary sinus under the guidance of 3-dimensional mapping system (CARTO). METHODS: A total of 15 patients with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) originating from left coronary sinus underwent CARTO-guided RCA. Anatomical structures were constructed and three-dimension (3D) electrical activation sequence was plotted for left ventricle and aortic sinus. The distance of earliest activation point of PVCs and origin of left coronary artery were surveyed after left coronary arteriography. RESULTS: The electrocardiogram (ECG) results showed that R-wave was upward in leads II, III and avF, QRS waves in lead I was mainly of rS, rs and rsr types, QS type in lead avL, RS, Rs and rS type in lead V(1), RS type in lead V(3) and absence of S wave in lead V(5)/V(6). Intraoperative mapping detected the earliest activation point on the posterior-inferior origin of left coronary artery (LMCA) ostium (n = 7), on the anterio-inferior of LMCA ostium (n = 3) and on the inferior of LMCA ostium (n = 5). The earliest activation point (local activation time) was shorter 86 - 120 ms than surface electrocardiogram QRS wave, discharge melting on the earliest activation point and nearby succeeded. PVCs disappeared, PVCs failed to be induced under similar preoperative conditions (aleudrin intravenous) and no complication occurred intraoperatively and postoperatively. CONCLUSION: The CARTO-guided RCA is a safe and effective in the treatment of PVCs originating from left coronary sinus.
