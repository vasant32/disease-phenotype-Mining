A storm of J wave-associated idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF) was observed in a 49-year-old man. Multiform premature ventricular complexes initiated the episodes of VF. Intravenous isoproterenol attenuated the J wave and suppressed the VF storm. After the implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator, VF was induced by programmed electrical stimulation at baseline, and it was terminated by a 25-J shock after an unsuccessful 15-J shock. During oral treatment with quinidine sulfate, 600 mg daily, the J wave was attenuated and VF became noninducible by programmed electrical stimulation. VF induced by a shock delivered on the T wave was terminated by a single 10-J shock. Mean F-F interval and dominant frequency of the VF were 162 ms and 6.8 Hz at baseline, and 210 ms and 5.0 Hz during the quinidine sulfate treatment.
