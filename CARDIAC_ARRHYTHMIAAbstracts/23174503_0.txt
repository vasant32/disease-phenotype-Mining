An electrophysiological study in a patient with a previous corridor operation was performed because of syncope. The atrial electrograms showed the persistence of the sinus rhythm in the right atrial corridor despite an organized atrial fibrillation in the left atrium. The first case described of a long term follow-up in a corridor operation, one of the first described surgical approach for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, that gave the beginning to the non-pharmacological approach of this arrhythmia.
