The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a key role in atrial structural and electrical remodeling. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential associations of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene insertion/ deletion (I/D) and aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) gene -344T/C polymorphisms with the risk and recurrence of lone atrial fibrillation (AF). One hundred and ninety-three patients who underwent successful catheter ablation for lone AF were recruited. Two hundred and ninety-seven sinus rhythm subjects without a history of arrhythmia served as controls. The subjects were genotyped for ACE gene I/D and CYP11B2 gene -344T/C polymorphisms. Results showed that the ACE gene DD genotype and D allele were associated with a greater prevalence of lone AF (both P<0.01). In addition, the ACE gene DD genotype had a significantly larger left atrial dimension (LAD; 41.6±5.7 mm vs. 39.6±5.2 mm; P=0.043) and higher risk of AF recurrence [44.7% vs. 23.2%; odds ratio (OR), 2.68; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.28-5.61; P=0.008] compared with the II+ID genotype in lone AF patients. After adjustment for a variety of risk factors, the ACE gene DD genotype had a 1.97-fold increased risk for lone AF (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.15-3.37; P= 0.013) and 2.35-fold increased risk for AF recurrence (RR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.10-5.04; P=0.028) compared with the ACE gene II+ID genotype. However, no correlation between the CYP11B2 gene -344T/C polymorphism and lone AF or its recurrence was observed in this cohort. In conclusion, the ACE gene DD genotype was associated with an increased incidence of lone AF and its recurrence following ablation, which was partly mediated by LAD.
