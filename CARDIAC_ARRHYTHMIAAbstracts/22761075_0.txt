 PURPOSE: The results of an investigation of serum magnesium concentrations (SMCs) after i.v. versus oral delivery of magnesium in cardiovascular critical care are presented. METHODS: A retrospective case review was conducted to compare the net gain of magnesium after i.v. (n = 188) or oral (n = 164) magnesium therapy for the prevention of ventricular fibrillation and arrhythmias in patients hospitalized for serious cardiovascular disorders, as determined by assessing SMCs. The primary study outcome was the change from baseline SMC values 6-24 hours after the completion of magnesium courses; secondary outcomes included the impact of renal impairment, concomitant medication use, and other clinical variables on SMC changes. RESULTS: Although consistent elevations in SMC were produced by oral magnesium delivery, i.v. administration resulted in greater and more rapid elevations relative to baseline SMC. The degree of change in SMC was significantly influenced by the timing of SMC measurement after a magnesium course, by renal function, and by concomitant use of i.v. loop diuretics. CONCLUSION: A comparison of 24-hour courses of magnesium replacement therapy showed that magnesium sulfate 2 g i.v. was associated with larger changes in SMC than magnesium oxide 800, 1200, or 1600 mg orally when the baseline SMC was 1.4-1.8 mg/dL. At baseline SMCs of 1.4-1.8 mg/dL, oral magnesium oxide provided a consistent median increase in SMC of 0.1 mg/dL. The change in the number of bowel movements did not differ significantly between courses of i.v. magnesium sulfate and oral magnesium oxide.
