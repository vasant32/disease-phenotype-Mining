In this paper we present a novel Dual-Slope QRS detection algorithm with low computational complexity, suitable for wearable ECG devices. The Dual-Slope algorithm calculates the slopes on both sides of a peak in the ECG signal; And based on these slopes, three criterions are developed for simultaneously checking 1)Steepness 2)Shape and 3)Height of the signal, to locate the QRS complex. The algorithm, evaluated against MIT/BIH Arrhythmia Database, achieves a very high detection rate of 99.45%, a sensitivity of 99.82% and a positive prediction of 99.63%.
