Isothiocyanates, among which alyssin is counted, are the compounds that have proved chemopreventive properties and the ability to induce the 2 and the 3 detoxification phase by affecting the transcription factor nuclear erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2). Having a positive effect on the human body, these compounds are used as dietary supplements. Because of the observed increase in the consumption of dietary supplements taken along with the drugs routinely used in medical practice, this study examined the possibility of interactions between alyssin and drugs, which could have an impact on cell metabolism. We have determined the effects of the tested substances and their interactions on the expression and activity of the phase 2 genes, as well as on the drug transport, which could be influenced by affecting the expression of transport proteins that belong to the 3 phase of metabolism. It was also studied whether the transcription factor Nrf2 is responsible for the interactions that occurred. The results showed that the interactions between alyssin and the tested drugs strengthen or weaken the effect of the drugs given separately depending on the concentration of alyssin and the type of drug. Even though Nrf2 is involved in the interaction, it seems that it is not the only factor regulating the interactions between the tested medications.
