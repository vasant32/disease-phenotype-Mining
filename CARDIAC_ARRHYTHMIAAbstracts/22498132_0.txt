Our aim was to describe the treatment and survival characteristics of Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) in Canterbury, New Zealand. The medical records of 48 patients diagnosed between 1 July 1997 and 31 December 2008 and fulfilling validated classification criteria for WG were reviewed to characterise survivorship in the province of Canterbury, New Zealand. The age at diagnosis was 61 years (range 20 to 83 years) with an equal number of males and females. Using Kaplan-Meier product-limit analysis, the probability of survival at 1 and 10 years was 91% and 62% respectively. Of the 12 deaths in the cohort, four occurred within 12 months of diagnosis: two from pulmonary haemorrhage and two from renal failure. Beyond 12 months, two patients died of renal failure, two of myocardial infarction and one from cardiac arrhythmia, one from cerebrovascular disease and two from colorectal carcinoma. The median time to relapse was 6.75 years, and the probability of relapse within 10 years was 67%. Survivorship, treatment response rate and the rate of relapse from WG in a cohort of patients from this high-prevalence southern hemisphere region were similar to that reported for northern hemisphere cohorts with a similar prevalence.
