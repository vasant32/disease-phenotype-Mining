In a clinical study, a novel wireless electrocardiogram (ECG) recorder has been evaluated with regard to its ability to perform arrhythmia diagnostics. As the ECG recorder will detect a "non-standard" ECG signal, it has been necessary to compare those signals to "standard" ECG recording signals in order to evaluate the arrhythmia detection ability of the new system. Simultaneous recording of ECG signals from both the new wireless ECG recorder and a conventional Holter recorder was compared by two independent cardiology specialists with regard to signal quality for performing arrhythmia diagnosis. In addition, calculated R-R intervals from the two systems were correlated. A total number of 16 patients participated in the study. It can be considered that recorded ECG signals obtained from the wireless ECG system had an acceptable quality for arrhythmia diagnosis. Some of the patients used the wireless sensor while doing physical sport activities, and the quality of the recorded ECG signals made it possible to perform arrhythmia diagnostics even under such conditions. Consequently, this makes possible improvements in correlating arrhythmias to physical activities.
