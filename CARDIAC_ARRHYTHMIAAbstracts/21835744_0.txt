A 29-year-old male was admitted to our outpatient clinic because of palpitation and documented narrow QRS arrhythmia. Based on the ECG, supraventricular tachycardia was diagnosed, electrophysiological examination was indicated and ablation therapy was recommended. During positioning of the catheter the patient developed arrhythmia. On the coronary sinus catheter the activation spread from distal to proximal electrodes, suggesting left atrial origin. During atrial entrainment pacing long return cycle was observed and distal coronary sinus pacing resulted in a 15 ms longer cycle length than the arrhythmia. Therefore, the left atrial origin of the arrhythmia was confirmed and double transseptal puncture was performed. Lasso and irrigated tip catheter were introduced into the left atrium and electroanatomical mapping was performed with CARTO3 system. After electroanatomical mapping the origin of tachycardia was located proximally in the left superior pulmonary vein. Ablation was started at the earliest activation point, where acceleration was observed and the arrhythmia stopped after the first ablation. Pulmonary vein isolation was completed, and bidirectional block could be confirmed. After 30 minutes the arrhythmia was not inducible. During follow-up, Holter-examination was negative and the patient remained asymptomatic. The pulmonary vein tachycardia is a supraventricular arrhythmia that can occur at any age, but the diagnosis based on the ECG is not always simple. Detailed electroanatomical mapping is very important in the diagnosis of this type of arrhythmia, although it can be verified with conventional electrophysiological methods as well. Focal ablation may be a therapeutic option; however, total isolation of pulmonary veins can be more effective.
