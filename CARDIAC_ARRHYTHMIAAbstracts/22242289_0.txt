Tachyarrhythmia, especially atrial fibrillation, remains as a common complication after open heart surgery and sometimes leads to fatal condition. Many reports showed that landiolol (ultra short-acting beta one blocker) and amiodarone were effective against postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF). However, there were few comparative studies between these 2 drugs as prophylactic agents, and no report mentioned the therapeutic efficacy. Our study suggests that landiolol be the 1st choice for rate control of tachyarrhythmia because of easy dose adjustment and mild side effects. Amiodarone may be useful for the patients whose left ventricular function is poor.
