An intervention for chronic acquired valvular heart disease may either be indicated in symptomatic patients to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life or in asymptomatic patients to improve long-term prognosis, e.g., by preventing disease-related complications like chronic heart failure or arrhythmias. For proper action according to current guidelines, the systematic evaluation of symptoms related to the underlying valve disease is of utmost importance. If a discrepancy between symptoms reported or not reported by the patients and the severity of the valve disease is supposed, true absence of symptoms and exercise tolerance should be verified by spiroergometry. In the truly asymptomatic patient with a severe valvular lesion, preservation of myocardial adaption to the chronic volume or pressure overload should be tested utilizing appropriate imaging techniques like radionuclide ventriculography under exercise conditions. The proper evaluation of the functional status is of growing importance in our aging population with its sedentary lifestyle. In this context, the results of a survey should be kept in mind, which indicated that a significant proportion of patients still have interventions too late during the natural history of their valve disease with symptoms of congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, and the risk of sudden cardiac death persisting after a primarily successful valve repair or replacement.
