Dermoid cysts are rare benign tumors of embryonic origin; they account for less than 1% of all intracranial tumors. Rarely, they may rupture and spread their fatty content into the subarachnoid space or lateral ventricles. Dermoid cyst rupture may occur spontaneously or be associated with previous closed head trauma. The clinical presentation can vary. We report a case of ruptured intracranial dermoid cyst after accessory pathway ablation for cardiac arrhythmia in a 54-year-old woman with no relevant neurologic history, and we discuss hypotheses about its etiopathogenic mechanism.
