AIMS: Differentiation between supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) remains a substantial clinical challenge in patients with single-chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) due to absence of visible P waves. Innovative optimization of intrathoracic electrogram (EGM) configuration will facilitate P-wave detection and rhythm differentiation during tachycardia.METHODS AND RESULTS: Innovative optimization of EGM configuration was originally performed to improve patient care. In this retrospective cohort study, we examined our database for records of 140 consecutive patients undergoing single-chamber ICD implantation. During the follow-ups of 61 included patients with optimized EGM configuration, 27 patients were identified to have VT and/or SVT. EGMs in the Can (generator) to superior vena cava (Can-SVC) configuration were compared with those conventionally from the Can to right ventricular coil (Can-RV coil) source in the same patients. In Can-SVC EGMs, the ratio of P/QRS amplitude was 14-fold higher (0.57 ± 0.08 vs. 0.04 ± 0.00, P < 0.001) compared with those in Can-RV coil EGMs during sinus rhythm. With Can-SVC configuration, the odds of atrioventricular dissociation detection in patients with VT was increased 15-fold (61.9% vs. 9.5% with Can-RV coil; odds ratio, 15.4; 95% confidence interval, 2.8 to 84.7; P = 0.0009). In patients with SVT, P-waves or retrograde P-waves were markedly more identifiable in Can-SVC configuration compared with Can-RV coil (odds ratio, 40; 95% confidence interval, 3.6 to 447.1; P = 0.0010).CONCLUSION: P-wave recognition by optimizing EGM configuration provides a novel diagnostic tool for differentiation between VT and SVT in single-chamber ICDs. A potential discrimination algorithm would provide a cost-effective approach to improving the qualitative outcomes.
