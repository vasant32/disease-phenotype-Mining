We present a 44-year-old man with invasive aortic and tricuspid valve endocarditis complicated by electrical storm, which was immediately diagnosed and successfully treated due to the patient's telemetry electrocardiogram (ECG). This case highlights a rare but potentially fatal complication in patients with invasive endocarditis and the need for very careful clinical evaluation and monitoring of these patients.
