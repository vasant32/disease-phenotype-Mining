Present day 24-h Holter monitors have been shown to miss many arrhythmias that may occur infrequently or under specific circumstances. The advancement in electronic and adhesive technologies have enabled the development of first generation wearable long-term 14-day patch ECG monitors that attach directly to the skin and require no electrodes and wires to operate. This new technology is unobtrusive to the patients and offers them unprecedented mobility. It enables very long-term monitoring of critical patients while they are carrying out daily activities. The monitors are waterproof, offer good adhesion to the skin and can operate as either recorders or wireless streaming devices.
