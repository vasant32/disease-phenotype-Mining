Despite the availability of several advanced non-invasive diagnostic tests such as echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging, electrocardiography (ECG) remains as the most widely used diagnostic technique in clinical cardiology. ECG detects electrical potentials that are generated by cardiac electrical activity. In addition to electrical potentials, the same electrical activity of the heart also induces magnetic fields. These extremely weak cardiac magnetic signals are detected by a non-invasive, contactless technique called magnetocardiography (MCG), which has been evaluated in a number of clinical studies for its usefulness in diagnosing heart diseases. We reviewed the basic principles, history and clinical data on the diagnostic role of MCG in coronary artery disease and cardiac arrhythmias.
