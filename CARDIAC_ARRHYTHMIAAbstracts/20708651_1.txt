The angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) is known to signal through heterotrimeric G proteins, and Gαq protein-independent signalling has only recently gained appreciation for profound impact on a diverse range of biological functions. β-Arrestins, among other central mediators of Gαq protein-independent signalling from the AT(1)R interact with transcriptional regulators and promote phosphorylation of nuclear proteins. However, the relative contribution of Gαq protein-independent signalling in AT(1)R mediated transcriptional regulation remains elusive. We here present a comprehensive comparative analysis of Gαq protein-dependent and -independent regulation of AT(1)R mediated gene expression. We found angiotensin II to regulate 212 genes, whereas Gαq-independent signalling obtained with the biased agonist, SII angiotensin II only regulated few genes. Interestingly, SII angiotensin II, like Ang II vastly potentiated β2-adrenergic receptor-stimulated gene expression. These novel findings indicate that the Gαq protein-independent signalling mainly modifies the transcriptional response governed by other signalling pathways, while direct induction of gene expression by the AT(1)R is dependent on classical Gαq protein activation.
