Endocardial fibroelastosis is a cardiomyopathy not commonly seen in the present age. We describe the case of a 4-year-old girl who presented with sustained incessant ventricular tachycardia, a severely dilated left ventricle, and cardiac dysfunction refractory to all medical management and even to ablation; she eventually underwent cardiac transplantation. The diagnosis was made only after histopathologic examination of the explanted heart showed clear evidence of endocardial fibroelastosis. Through this report, we would like to highlight the fact that primary endocardial fibroelastosis can masquerade as idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and that associated frequent premature ventricular contractions and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia require close monitoring. Progressive ventricular dilation and ventricular dysfunction can convey a poor prognosis. Sustained recalcitrant ventricular tachycardia in these patients can be a life-threatening event that requires emergent mechanical support and heart transplantation.
