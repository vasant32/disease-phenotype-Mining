 OBJECTIVE OF STUDY: To evaluate the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of ventricular tachycardia (VT) using non-contact electro-anatomic mapping in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C). METHODS: Fifteen consecutive patients (44 ± 15 years) with ARVD/C and symptomatic VTs were studied. Eight patients had syncopal VTs. Two patients had recurrent VT while on AICD; in three patients, RFA was done prior to AICD implantation, and ten patients refused AICD. After obtaining activation maps, first, the clinical VT was targeted, and then, other VTs were sought. RESULTS: Twenty-five inducible VTs were mapped, and 22 of them were successfully ablated. In 13 out of 15 patients, all the clinical and inducible VTs were ablated. In two patients, non-clinical inducible VTs could not be ablated. At 25 ± 16 months (2-52 months), all patients remained asymptomatic. Antiarrhythmic medications were discontinued after 6 months. Two patients had recurrence of non-clinical VT on follow-up. There were no episodes of asymptomatic VT recorded in five patients with AICD. CONCLUSION: A majority of induced VT in patients with ARVD/C can be successfully mapped and ablated using the non-contact Ensite Array Mapping system with good long-term VT-free outcome. Ablation can be a useful adjunct to AICD implantation in such patients.
