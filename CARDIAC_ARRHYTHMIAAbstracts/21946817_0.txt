 INTRODUCTION: A number of predisposing factors have been suggested to be contributing to drug-induced torsade de pointes (TdP) arrhythmias: short-long-short (SLS) sequence, bradycardia, timing of drug administration, anaesthesia, ventricular remodelling, and altered ventricular activation due to ventricular ectopic beats (SLS) or idioventricular rhythm (IVR). Chronic atrio-ventricular (AV)-block (CAVB) dogs are susceptible to dofetilide-induced TdP. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 32 anaesthetized animals, the relevance of ventricular remodelling for TdP susceptibility was studied by dofetilide [0.025 mg/kg/5 min intravenously (iv)] during bradycardia in the presence (CAVB, n= 18) or absence [acute atrio-ventricular block (AVB), n= 32] of ventricular remodelling. In sub-protocols, the possible pro-arrhythmic effects of timing of dofetilide administration: prior to (n= 11), or after creation of AVB (n= 9) and relevance of SLS pacing (n= 17) was investigated during IVR. Dofetilide was also given after AVB when the activation of the ventricles was normal: pacing (1000 ms) from the high septum (n= 7) or abnormal but fixed from the left ventricular apex (n= 5). Torsade de pointes inducibility was defined as reproducible (â‰¥ 3 times) occurrence. In acute AV block (AAVB), dofetilide did not induce TdP spontaneously (0 of 32), whereas TdP was seen in 10 out of 18 serially tested dogs in CAVB (P< 0.001). The other factors: timing of dofetilide (0 of 11 vs. 0 of 9), SLS pacing (0 of 17 vs. 1 of 17), or ventricular activation (0 of 7 vs. 0 of 5) did not increase TdP susceptibility. Beat-to-beat variability of repolarization increased after ventricular remodelling and was highest prior to TdP induction. CONCLUSION: In AAVB dogs, TdP is not spontaneously seen, whereas it is present in CAVB. This implies that ventricular remodelling is a prerequisite for TdP induction in this model.
