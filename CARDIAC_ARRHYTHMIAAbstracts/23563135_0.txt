OBJECTIVES: We investigated the prevalence of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and its association with ventricular arrhythmias in a cohort with 'unexplained' out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). BACKGROUND: Ventricular arrhythmias are an important cause of sudden unexpected death (SUD) in the young. The role of MVP in SUD remains controversial. METHODS: Of 1200 patients evaluated between 07/2000 and 12/2009 in our Long QT Syndrome/Genetic Heart Rhythm Clinic, we reviewed all 24 (16 females, median age 33.5 years) with idiopathic OHCA (i.e. ischemia/cardiomyopathy/channelopathy negative). RESULTS: All 24 patients had implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD). OHCA was the sentinel event in 22 (92%). Bileaflet MVP was found in 10 (42%). Compared to patients with normal mitral valves, patients with bileaflet MVP (i) were over-represented by females (9/10 [90%] vs. 7/14 [50%], p=0.04), (ii) had a higher prevalence of biphasic/inverted T waves (7/9 [77.8%] vs. 4/14 [29%], p= 0.04), and (iii) on Holter interrogation had higher prevalence of ventricular bigeminy (9/9 [100%] vs. 1/10 [10%], p<0.0001), ventricular tachycardia (7/9 [78%] vs. 1/10 [10%], p= 0.006), and premature ventricular contractions (PVC) originating from outflow tract alternating with papillary muscle/fascicular region (7/9 [78%] vs. 2/10 [20%], p= 0.02). Over a median (range) 1.8 (0.1 - 11.9) years from ICD placement, 13/24 (54%) have received appropriate ventricular fibrillation (VF)-terminating ICD shocks. Only bileaflet MVP was associated with VF recurrences requiring ICD therapy on follow-up (logistic regression OR 7.2 with 95% CI from 1.1 - 48, p=0.028). CONCLUSIONS: We describe a 'malignant' subset of patients with MVP who experienced life threatening ventricular arrhythmias. This phenotype is characterized by bileaflet MVP, female sex, and frequent complex ventricular ectopy including PVC of outflow tract alternating with papillary muscle/fascicular origin.
