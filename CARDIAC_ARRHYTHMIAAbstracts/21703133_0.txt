Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia responsible for a significant morbidity and mortality. In recent years, progress has been made in determining the genetic abnormalities, the use of anticoagulants as a component of a primary treatment strategy in many patients who have a high risk of recurrence and for thromboembolism, and newer and safer antiarrthythmics are now available. The aim of this paper is to discuss about this topic and antiarrhythmic therapy.
