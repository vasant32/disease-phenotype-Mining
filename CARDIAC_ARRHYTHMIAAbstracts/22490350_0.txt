 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the early and midterm postoperative outcomes and analyze risk factors of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in octogenarians. METHODS: Clinical data of 38 patients aged 80 years or greater receiving isolated coronary artery bypass grafting from September 2001 to November 2010 were reviewed. There were 33 male and 5 female patients, aging from 80 to 87 years with a mean of (82.6 ± 1.2) years. Twelve patients underwent conventional (on-pump) CABG and 26 patients underwent off-pump CABG. The number of bypass grafts was 1 to 5 (mean 2.5 ± 1.1). Left internal mammary artery was used in 37 (97.3%) patients. RESULTS: The perioperative mortality was 2.6% (1/38). Postoperative complications included stroke (4 cases), respiratory infection (1 case). The atrial arrhythmias occurred in 25 patients. Intensive care unit and hospital length of stay lasted (3.8 ± 1.4) days and (15 ± 6) days, respectively. Totally 38 patients were followed up for 4 to 70 months. Six patients died during the follow-up period. The 92.6% patients recovered without any cardiac events. CONCLUSIONS: Isolated CABG can be performed safely with acceptable postoperative morbidity and mortality in octogenarians. Appropriate surgical strategy and intensive perioperative treatment must be enhanced in octogenarians who underwent CABG.
