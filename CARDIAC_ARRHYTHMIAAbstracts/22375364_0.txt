The choice of antiarrhythmic therapy for atrial fibrillation is directly dependent on the clinical presentation. This article describes the treatment of acute attacks associated with paroxysmal forms, and also of more persistent forms. First-line relapse prevention is based on antiarrhythmic drugs, but other options such as atrial catheter ablation have recently been developed. Ablation of the normal conducting atrioventricular pathway and direct atrial surgery are also discussed.
