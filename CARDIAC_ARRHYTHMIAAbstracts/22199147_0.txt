A 56-year-old man with atrial fibrillation and complete left bundle branch block (CLBBB) developed heart failure refractory to the initial medical treatment. Both the CLBBB and cardiac dysfunction completely recovered only with an advanced medical regimen for rate control and heart failure. This report describes a case with reversible CLBBB following tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, who was not a candidate for cardiac resynchronization therapy.
