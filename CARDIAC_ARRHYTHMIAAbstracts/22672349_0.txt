 AIM: Elderly patients often remain underrepresented in clinical trials. The aim of our study was to analyze the treatment, clinical outcome and risk factors for mortality in patients aged ≥85 years with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). METHODS: From 2005-2011, 102 patients aged ≥85 years with STEMI admitted to a coronary care unit were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical data, treatment and outcome were recorded. Reperfusion strategy and its influence in hospital morbidity and mortality were evaluated. Morbidity was defined as the presence of heart failure (Killip-Kimball >1), arrhythmias, mechanical complications, stroke or major bleeding. Risk factors for mortality were assessed by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The mean age was 87.5±2.5 years (range 85-96). Therapeutic strategy on admission was: primary-angioplasty (PCI) for 33 patients (32.3%) fibrinolysis for 30 patients (29.4%) and conservative treatment for 35 patients (34.3%). In the four remaining patients, rescue angioplasty was required. A total of 29 patients (28.4%) died, and morbidity was seen in 63 patients (61.7%). The morbidity and mortality rates in the conservative treatment group (77.1% and 48.5%) were higher than that found in the reperfusion strategy group (primary-PCI and fibrinolysis; 53.7% and 17.9%; P=0.02 and P=0.002, respectively). Regarding mortality, the univariate analysis showed that heart failure on admission (P=0.0001) and previous coronary artery disease (P=0.01) were prognostic variables. Only heart failure was an independent risk factor for mortality (odds ratio=3.64, 95% CI 0.78-21.87, P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Mortality and morbidity in very elderly patients with STEMI are very high, especially in those not receiving reperfusion therapies. Heart failure on admission was an independent risk factor for hospital mortality.
