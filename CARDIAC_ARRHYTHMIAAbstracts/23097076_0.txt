Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) can predict ventricular arrhythmia and poor prognosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients. Although myocardial T2-high signal has been reported to appear within LGE in those patients, its clinical significance remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between the T2-high signal and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) in HCM patients. Eighty-one HCM patients who underwent Holter ECG and CMR including T2-weighted and LGE imaging were retrospectively recruited. They were divided into NSVT-positive and NSVT-negative groups. We compared the clinical and CMR characteristics between both of the groups, and assessed predictors of NSVT with multivariate analysis. Myocardial T2-high signal was observed in 15/81 (18.5 %) patients. Each T2-high signal was localized within LGE. Significantly in the NSVT-positive group, the prevalence of atrial fibrillation [5/17 (29.4 %) vs. 2/64 (3.1 %), p = 0.0006] and T2-high signal [9/17 (52.9 %) vs. 6/64 (9.4 %), p < 0.0001] and the left ventricular (LV) end-systolic volume index (32.2 ± 15.9 ml/m(2) vs. 23.3 ± 14.9 ml/m(2), p = 0.034) and the number of segments with LGE (5.8 ± 3.3 vs. 2.7 ± 2.7, p < 0.0001) was increased, and the LV ejection fraction (54.8 ± 10.9 % vs. 65.1 ± 10.6 %, p = 0.0007) was decreased, compared to the NSVT-negative group. On multivariate analysis, the presence of atrial fibrillation (OR 29.49, p = 0.0025) and DM (OR 7.36, p = 0.0455) and T2-high signal (OR 14.96, p = 0.0014) and reduced LV ejection fraction (OR 0.93, p = 0.0222) were significantly associated with NSVT. The presence of myocardial T2-high signal is a significant independent predictor of NSVT in HCM patients.
