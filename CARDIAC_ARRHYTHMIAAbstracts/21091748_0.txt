We describe a case of ablation of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia in a patient with tricuspid atresia and L-malposition of great vessels using an electroanatomical mapping system integrated with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Atrial activation mapping during tachycardia identified the retrograde fast pathway proximal to the His bundle, observed in the left interatrial septum. Ablation was successfully completed below this area. Map integration with the patient's anatomy allowed a safe, individualized procedure.
