Type 1 myotonic dystrophy is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder related to the expansion of a trinucleotide (CTG) repeat in the exon 15 in the 3'-untranslated region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene. Mutant transcripts containing an expanded CUG repeat are retained in nuclear foci and cause numerous dysfunctions by interfering with biogenesis of other mRNAs. Prominent clinical features are progressive muscular weakness and myotonia, which affect skeletal muscles but also white muscles leading to digestive, urinary and obstetrical disorders. Functional prognosis correlates with motor handicap and vital prognosis is linked to cardiac rhythm disturbances and conduction defects due to progressive subendocardial fibrosis, and to complex respiratory dysfunctions, which associate restrictive lung disease, involvement of the central inspiratory pathway, and sleep apnea. Other clinical features are lens opacity, glucose intolerance, metabolic syndrome, several endocrine disorders (gonadal deficiency, hyperparathydoidism), or immunoglobulin deficiency due to immunoglobulin G hypercatabolism. Life expectancy is reduced in myotonic dystrophy, and death is mainly caused by respiratory complications, but also by cardiac arrhythmias. Moreover, an abnormal incidence of tumors has been reported. Therefore, myotonic dystrophy does not only concern neurologists but a multidisciplinary approach is necessary, including at least pneumologist, cardiologist, and physiotherapist. General internists should also be implicated, not only in the initial diagnosis step, but also in the diagnosis of complications and their treatments.
