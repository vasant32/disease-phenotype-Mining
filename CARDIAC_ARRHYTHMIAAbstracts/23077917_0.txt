Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent used for various types of tachyarrhythmia, both ventricular and supraventricular (atrial) arrhythmia. A spectrophotometric method for the assay of amiodarone was established. Based on the reduction of potassium ferricyanide in hydrochloric acid medium to potassium ferrocyanide forming a blue colored complex ferric ferrocyanide with Fe (III) ions. The compound was most stable in a mixture of ethylic alcohol and water (2:1, v/v) and it had an absorption maximum at 725 nm. The data were according to the Lambert-Beer Law in the concentration range of 0.5-5.0 microg/sample: correlation and coefficient R = 0.99977, R2 = 0.999541, slope of the line 0.12775, intercept 0.042077. The detection limit (DL) was 0.1032 microg/sample and the quantification limit (QL) 0.344 microg/ sample.
