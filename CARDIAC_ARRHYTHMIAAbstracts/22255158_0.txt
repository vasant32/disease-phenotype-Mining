We present an approach to identifying and reconstructing corrupted regions in a multi-parameter physiological signal. The method, which uses information in correlated signals, is specifically designed to preserve clinically significant aspects of the signals. We use template matching to jointly segment the multi-parameter signal, morphological dissimilarity to estimate the quality of the signal segment, similarity search using features on a database of templates to find the closest match, and time-warping to reconstruct the corrupted segment with the matching template. In experiments carried out on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, a two-parameter database with many clinically significant arrhythmias, our method improved the classification accuracy of the beat type by more than 7 times on a signal corrupted with white Gaussian noise, and increased the similarity to the original signal, as measured by the normalized residual distance, by more than 2.5 times.
