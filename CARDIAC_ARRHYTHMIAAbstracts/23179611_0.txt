This article is a brief review of baroreflex physiology, the definition and functional meaning of baroreflex sensitivity, and the methods used to measure baroreflex sensitivity. The arterial baroreflex is important for haemodynamic stability and for cardioprotection, and it has convincingly been demonstrated that baroreflex sensitivity, even when assessed with different methods, has a strong prognostic value. Development of new baroreflex assessing procedures is still ongoing, with a focus on increased reliability in difficult measuring circumstances, e.g., in patients with a weak baroreflex and in patients with frequent arrhythmias.
