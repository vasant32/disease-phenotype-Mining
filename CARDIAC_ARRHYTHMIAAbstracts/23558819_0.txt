Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) is a treatment mode in patients with recurrent, symptomatic, ventricular arrhythmias. A rare but potentially life-threatening complication of RFCA includes injury to the coronary arteries, which leads to acute occlusion and myocardial infarction. In the few reported cases, the most frequently affected vessel has been the left main coronary artery. We present the case of a 28 year-old female. During the RFCA procedure, an acute occlusion of the left main coronary artery occurred, which was treated successfully with emergency angioplasty.
