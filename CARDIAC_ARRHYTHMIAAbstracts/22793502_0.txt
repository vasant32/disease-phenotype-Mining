Background: The effectiveness of short-term 3,5,3'-triiodothyroacetic acid (TRIAC) therapy for the treatment of hyperthyroidism caused by thyroid hormone resistance (RTH) has been documented. Here, we report a 3-year course of TRIAC therapy in an RTH boy, with quantitative evaluation of the therapeutic effects and pharmacological study of TRIAC. Patient findings: The gene encoding the thyroid hormone receptor beta (THRB) of the patient carries a P453T mutation. During treatment with up to 3.0 mg TRIAC per day, reduction in thyroid volume, resolution of supraventricular arrhythmia, and decrease in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels were achieved. In addition, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms improved, with a concomitant decline in ADHD Rating Scale score. Summary: A TRIAC pharmacokinetic study, conducted using triiodothyronine (T3) level as a surrogate for TRIAC level, demonstrated that TRIAC disappears from the circulation rapidly and has a shorter duration of TSH-secretion inhibitory effect in the RTH patient compared to that in the control subject. Studies of TSH and FT4 levels over a period of 3 years indicated that the TRIAC effect is dose-dependent. Conclusions: TRIAC was effective and safe in ameliorating the effects of hyperthyroidism and ADHD symptoms in a child with known genetic RTH. Further, it was demonstrated that TRIAC has a short half-life and functions dose-dependently.
