BACKGROUND: Our purpose was to assess the prevalence and clinical implications of left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) diastolic dysfunction (DD) in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). METHODS: Adults with repaired TOF at 11 North American congenital heart disease centres were included. Of 556 patients analyzed, 325 had sufficient Doppler data to evaluate for LV DD, defined as mitral lateral e' < 10 cm/s and E/e' ratio > 9. Abnormal RV diastolic function was defined as tricuspid E/A ratio of 0.8 to 2.1 with E/e' ratio > 6 or a tricuspid ratio E/A > 2.1 with a deceleration time < 120 milliseconds, and 105 patients were found to have sufficient Doppler data. RESULTS: Abnormal LV diastolic Doppler indices were prevalent in 13.8% and associated with hypertension, dyslipidemia, 3 or more cardiac operations, and a history of ventricular tachycardia. Abnormal RV indices were prevalent in 52.4% and associated with hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and 3 or more cardiac operations. Ventricular tachycardia was more common in those with abnormal RV diastolic function. CONCLUSION: Further prospective studies are needed to evaluate these associations with DD and the impact of treatment risk factors on diastolic function and arrhythmia burden.
