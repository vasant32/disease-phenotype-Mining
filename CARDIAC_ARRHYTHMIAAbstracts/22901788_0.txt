 INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The findings of the 2011 Spanish Catheter Ablation Registry are presented. METHODS: Data were collected in two ways: retrospectively using a standardized questionnaire, and prospectively from a central database. Each participating center selected its own preferred method of data collection. RESULTS: Sixty-six Spanish centers voluntarily contributed data to the survey. Some 9662 ablation procedures were analyzed, averaging 146 (104) per center. The three main conditions treated were atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (n=2537; 26%), typical atrial flutter (n=2205; 23%) and accessory pathways (n=1813; 19%). Atrial fibrillation was the fourth most common substrate treated (n=1535; 16%) and showed a slight increase over figures for 2010. Ventricular arrhythmia ablation has increased considerably. The overall success rate was 94%; major complications occurred in 2.2% and overall mortality was 0.04%. CONCLUSIONS: Data from the 2011 registry show a continued increase in the number of ablations performed with a generally high success rate and few complications. The use of complex substrate ablation continues to grow.
