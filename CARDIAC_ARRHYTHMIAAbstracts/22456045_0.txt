 OBJECTIVES: To determine if heart rate (HR) is associated with desaturation indexes as HR is associated with arrhythmia and sudden death. STUDY DESIGN: A community based cross-sectional study of 1214 Alaskan Inuit. METHODS: Data of FA concentrations from plasma and red blood cell membranes from those ≥35 years of age (n = 819) were compared to basal HR at the time of examination. Multiple linear regression with backward stepwise selection was employed to analyze the effect of the desaturase indexes on HR, after adjustment for relevant covariates. RESULTS: The Δ(5) desaturase index (Δ(5)-DI) measured in serum has recently been associated with a protective role for cardiovascular disease. This index measured here in plasma and red blood cells showed a negative correlation with HR. The plasma stearoyl-CoA-desaturase (SCD) index, previously determined to be related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, on the other hand, was positively associated with HR, while the Δ(6) desaturase index (Δ(6)-DI) had no significant effect on HR. CONCLUSION: Endogenous FA desaturation is associated with HR and thereby, in the case of SCD, possibly with arrhythmia and sudden death, which would at least partially explain the previously observed association between cardiovascular mortality and desaturase activity.
