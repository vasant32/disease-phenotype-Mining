We report a 47 year-old male patient with coexistence of left ventricular noncompaction and Brugada syndrome. He presented malignant ventricular arrhythmias followed by cardioverter- -defibrillator implantation, atrial fibrillation and flutter and progressive heart failure. This case could be an example of the coexistence of two rare diseases of various genetic patterns that only partially showed overlapping symptomatology and complications, particularly ventricular arrhythmias.
