 BACKGROUND: cardiac arrhythmias are commonly observed in the fetus, however, may have major consequences for fetal development and post natal life. AIMS: to evaluate the perinatal management and cardiac outcome of fetuses with tachy- or bradyarrhythmia. STUDY DESIGN: perinatal management, outcome and long-term cardiac follow-up were evaluated retrospectively in consecutive fetuses with cardiac arrhythmias. RESULTS: forty-four fetuses were diagnosed: supraventricular tachycardia (SVT, n=28), atrial flutter (AF, n=7) and atrioventricular block (AVB, n=9). The overall incidence of cardiac anomalies was 18% mainly in the AVB group; hydrops was present in 34%. Direct or transplacental fetal anti-arrhythmic medication was given in 76%. Mortality was 6% in SVT/AF and 78% in the AVB group, respectively. AF resolved in all patients. In the SVT group, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome was present in 21%, diagnosed at birth or later in life. After the age of one year about 90% of patients in the SVT group remained asymptomatic and free of drugs (median follow-up 76months). CONCLUSIONS: mortality rate is low in patients with fetal SVT and AF but high in patients with AVB. Related morbidity includes WPW-syndrome and congenital cardiac anomalies. Electrocardiographic screening is recommended in all fetal SVT cases before adolescence since WPW-syndrome may occur later in life.
