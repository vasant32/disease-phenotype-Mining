Relief of right ventricular (RV) outflow tract obstruction in tetralogy of Fallot or similar physiology often results in pulmonary regurgitation (PR). The resultant chronic volume overload can lead to RV dilatation, biventricular dysfunction, heart failure symptoms, arrhythmias and sudden death. Although pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) can lead to improvement in the functional class and a substantial decrease or normalization of RV volumes, the optimal timing of PVR is not well defined. Benefits of PVR have to be weighed against the risks of this procedure including subsequent reoperation. This article reviews the pathophysiology of chronic PR, evidence-based benefits and risks of PVR, options for valve substitute, and optimal timing of PVR in patients with chronic PR after relief of RV outflow tract obstruction.
