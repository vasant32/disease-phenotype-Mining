Idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a relatively benign and rare form of VT. It is seen in young people without demonstrable cardiac pathology. The aim of our study was to review the clinical picture of idiopathic VT, before evaluating the indications for antiarrhythmic treatment and the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA). The notes of patients diagnosed with idiopathic VT in the last 13 years (n: 22) were included in the study. The median age of onset was 11 years (1 month-16 years). We evaluated the findings regarding the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of these patients. The most common initial symptom was palpitation, in 15 cases. Five children with idiopathic VT were symptom-free. VT was of right ventricular origin in 10 patients and left ventricular origin in 8 patients. Beta-blockers were the mainstay of medical treatment in right VT and calcium channel blockers (Ca-channel blocker) were mostly used in left VT cases. The success rate of RFA was 57% in right VT and 100% in left VT. The median follow-up was 41 months (9 months-60 months), and all patients are alive currently with no symptoms. VT without demonstrable cardiac pathology is associated with a good prognosis. Treatment is unnecessary for asymptomatic non-sustained VT. RFA is useful in patients with symptomatic drug-refractory idiopathic VT arising from the left or right ventricle.
