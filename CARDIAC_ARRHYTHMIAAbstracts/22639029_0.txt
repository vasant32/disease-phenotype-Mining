A 46-year-old man presented with severe pain in our emergency department. In addition he had macrohematuria, the further medical history was inconspicuous. The pain showed to be resistant to therapy, therefore we performed a CT scan of the abdomen. The CT scan showed a partial embolism of the right renal artery, a thrombus of the aorta thoracica as well as partial infarction of the spleen and the liver. An immediately initiated therapy with implantation of an aortal stent graft for fixation of the thrombus and an ActilyseÂ® therapy led to full recovery of the patient. Closer questioning of the patient showed that the patient undertook an extended abdominal and thoracic muscle training programme by letting an eight-kilogram bowling ball fall down onto his abdomen from about 80 cm height. The diagnosis embolism of the renal artery cannot be made without extended diagnostics in the emergency room. A good hint for perfusion disorders of the kidney can be obtained with duplex ultrasound. Therapy-resistant pain without hydronephrosis and concomitant arrhythmia of the patient can lead to the diagnosis. The initiation of an adequate diagnosis and therapy is essential as otherwise persisting perfusion disorders of the kidney may occur.
