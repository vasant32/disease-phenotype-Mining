Atrial fibrillation (AF) is currently the most commonly treated cardiac arrhythmia. It is generally a progressive disease, often more difficult to control as electromechanical remodeling alters the underlying substrate. Patients typically evolve from infrequent, self-terminating episodes, to more frequent and sustained events. In addition, atrial remodeling may make sinus rhythm more challenging to achieve. Although an ablation strategy limited to pulmonary vein isolation may be curative in those with paroxysmal AF, a more extensive approach is often required in those with persistent AF. This article discusses the current approaches and most recent advances in the ablation of persistent and long-standing persistent AF.
