Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been developed as an alternative to conventional aortic valve replacement for the treatment of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis in high-risk patients. Nevertheless, TAVI has been associated with serious complications such as stroke, vascular injury, renal failure and arrhythmia. Herein we describe a case of distortion of the Edward-Sapien prosthesis (Edwards Lifesciences, USA), which was mounted on a balloon-expandable stent, after chest compression for cardiac resuscitation in a patient who underwent TAVI for severe aortic stenosis.
