Numerous unusual causes of atrioventricular block (AVB) with cardiac pacemaker implantation have been documented including cough, deglutition, or other vagally mediated mechanism. In spinal cord lesions, only high cervical spinal cord lesion has been reported as a cause of severe bradycardia. We report a case with not cervical but dorsal vertebral trauma and persistent paroxysmal AVB requiring cardiac pacemaker implantation.
