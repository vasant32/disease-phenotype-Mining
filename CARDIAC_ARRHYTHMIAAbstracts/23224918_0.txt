Arrhythmias play a significant role in the mortality and morbidity as well as hospitalizations  of patients who carry a diagnosis of congestive heart failure. With improving survival in a world  of novel medications and devices, an understanding of the pathophysiology and management  of these arrhythmias is crucial. Majority of the basic heart failure medications such as beta-  -blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/aldosterone receptor blockers and aldosterone  antagonists play a pivotal role in prevention of sudden cardiac deaths which can be  a direct/indirect result of these arrhythmias. Anti-arrhythmic drugs and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators were also beneficial in selected patients. Innovative electrophysiological techniques  need to be considered in special situations.
