A 50-year-old man with a history of renal cell carcinoma was admitted with ventricular tachycardia. Echocardiography showed a mass in the apex of the left ventricle. Cardiac magnetic resonance confirmed a mass infiltrating the anterior-apical wall of the left ventricle. This is the first case describing an association between ventricular tachycardia and renal cell carcinoma metastatic to the left ventricle.
