AIMS: Prior reports using pacing manoeuvres, demonstrated an up to 42% prevalence of residual pulmonary vein to left atrium (PV-LA) exit conduction after apparent LA-PV entry block. We aimed to determine in a two-centre study the prevalence of residual PV-LA exit conduction in the presence of unambiguously proven entry block and without pacing manoeuvres.METHODS AND RESULTS: Of 378 patients, 132 (35%) exhibited spontaneous pulmonary vein (PV) potentials following circumferential PV isolation guided by three-dimensional mapping and a circular mapping catheter. Pulmonary vein automaticity was regarded as unambiguous proof of LA-PV entry block. We determined the prevalence of spontaneous exit conduction of the spontaneous PV potentials toward the LA. Pulmonary vein automaticity was observed in 171 PVs: 61 right superior PV, 33 right inferior PV, 47 left superior PV, and 30 left inferior PV. Cycle length of the PV automaticity was >1000 ms in all cases. Spontaneous PV-LA exit conduction was observed in one of 171 PVs (0.6%). In a subset of 69 PVs, pacing from within the PV invariably confirmed PVLA exit block.CONCLUSION: Unidirectional block at the LA-PV junction is unusual (0.6%). This observation is supportive of LA-PV entry block as a sufficient electrophysiological endpoint for PV isolation.
