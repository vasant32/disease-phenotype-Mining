 AIMS: The Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Pilot Study is a prospective, multinational registry conducted by the European Heart Rhythm Association of the European Society of Cardiology that has been designed to describe the clinical epidemiology of patients undergoing an atrial fibrillation (AFib) ablation procedure, and the diagnostic/therapeutic processes applied in these patients across Europe. We present the results of the short-term (in-hospital) analysis. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 72 centres in 10 European countries were asked to enrol 20 consecutive patients scheduled for a first AFib ablation procedure. Between October 2010 and May 2011, 1410 patients were included, of which 1391 underwent an AFib ablation (98.7%). The median age was 60 years [inter-quartile range (IQR) 52-66], and 28% were females. Two-thirds presented paroxysmal AFib and 38% lone AFib. Symptoms were present in 86%. The indications for ablation were mostly symptomatic AFib, but in over a third of patients there was also a desire for a drug-free lifestyle and the maintenance of sinus rhythm. Pulmonary vein isolation was attempted in 98.4% of patients, the roof line in 21.3% and the mitral isthmus line in 12.8%. Complex-fractionated atrial electrograms were targeted in 17.9% and the ganglionated plexi in 3.3%. Complications occurred in 7.7%, of which 1.7% was major (i.e. cardiac perforation, myocardial infraction, endocarditis, cardiac arrest, stroke, hemothorax, pneumothorax, and sepsis). The median duration of hospitalization was 3 days (IQR 2-4). At discharge, 91.4% of patients were in sinus rhythm, 88.3% of patients were given vitamin K antagonists, and 67% antiarrhythmic medication. There was one death after the ablation procedure. CONCLUSION: The AFib Ablation Pilot Study provides crucial information on AF ablation in clinical practice across Europe. These data are relevant for further improvement of the management strategies of patients suffering from atrial fibrillation.
