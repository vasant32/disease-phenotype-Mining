Despite debates regarding its cardioprotection and pro-arrhythmia, the definite mechanisms of rosiglitazone on the heart are still unclear. We determined the mechanistic effects of rosiglitazone on cardiac function, arrhythmias and infarct size during cardiac ischemic/reperfusion (I/R). Methods: Twenty-six rats were utilized. In each rat, either rosiglitazone or saline solution was administered intravenously prior to a 30-minute left anterior descending coronary artery ligation and a 120-minute reperfusion. Cardiac function, infarct size, myocardial level of connexin43, Bax/Bcl-2, cytochrome-c, caspase-3, caspase-8, Akt, TNF-α, IL-4, and cardiac mitochondrial function were determined. Isolated cardiomyocytes were used for studying intracellular calcium. Results: Rosiglitazone did not alter cardiac function during the I/R periods, but increased the arrhythmia score and mortality rate, decreased the time to ventricular fibrillation onset, and prolonged Ca2+ decay rate, compared to the saline group (P<0.05). However, the infarct size in the rosiglitazone group was decreased (P<0.05). Rosiglitazone decreased the levels of connexin43 phosphorylation, active caspase-8, and TNF-α, but increased the procaspase-3 level. However, levels of Bax/Bcl-2, cytochrome-c, Akt, IL-4, and cardiac mitochondrial function were not different between the two groups. Conclusions: Rosiglitazone simultaneously exerted both beneficial and adverse cardiac effects in the I/R heart. Although it decreased the infarct size via the extrinsic anti-apoptotic pathway, and anti-inflammation, rosiglitazone facilitated a fatal arrhythmia by decreasing the connexin43 phosphorylation, and prolonging the Ca2+ decay rate in I/R rats. The higher mortality rate in the rosiglitazone group suggests that its undesirable effect was more pronounced than its benefit on infarct size reduction.
