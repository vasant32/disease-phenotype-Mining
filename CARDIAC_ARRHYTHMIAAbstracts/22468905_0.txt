 BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of white coat hypertension (WCH) to atrial conduction abnormalities by electrocardiographic P-wave analysis and echocardiographic electromechanical coupling (EMC) interval measurement. METHODS: The study consisted of sex-, age-, and body mass index-matched 24 patients with WCH, 24 patients with sustained hypertension (SH), and 24 subjects with normotension (NT). The difference between the maximum (Pmax) and minimum P-wave durations on 12-lead electrocardiography was defined as P-wave dispersion (PD). Intra- and inter-atrial EMC were measured by tissue Doppler imaging. RESULTS: Pmax and PD of subjects with WCH were significantly higher than those of normotensives and lower than those of patients with SH. Inter-atrial EMC and left atrial EMC values of WCH group were intermediate between NT and SH groups. There was a significant correlation between left atrial diameter, PD, Pmax, left ventricle mass index, left atrial EMC, and inter-atrial EMC. CONCLUSION: White coat hypertension is an intermediate group between SH and NT in terms of atrial electromechanical abnormalities which may be associated with the risk of atrial fibrillation.
