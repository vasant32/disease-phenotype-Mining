AIMS: The Calgary Syncope Symptom Score (CSSS) has been validated as a simple point score of historical features with high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of vasovagal syncope (VVS) in younger populations without evidence of structural heart disease. Our purpose was to evaluate the performance of the CSSS in an elderly population with suspected VVS.METHODS AND RESULTS: Hundred and eighty patients of ≥60 years of age (mean 73.4 ± 7.8) with suspected clinical diagnosis of VVS were studied. The CSSS (VVS score ≥-2) was calculated in all patients prior to undergoing head-up tilt test (HUT). A standardized HUT protocol with active nitroglycerin phase was used to reproduce syncopal symptoms as gold standard for diagnosis of VVS. Hundred and forty patients had positive HUT response. Eighty-three patients (42.3%) had CSSS ≥-2 suggesting a diagnosis of VVS. The Calgary Syncope Symptom Score sensitivity was 0.51 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42-0.59] and specificity 0.73 (95% CI 0.52-0.85) with positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 0.87 (95% CI 0.77-0.93) and 0.30 (95% CI 0.21-0.40), respectively. One hundred (55.6%) patients had previous history of mild cardiovascular disease documented during assessment prior to HUT. In this population sensitivity and specificity was markedly reduced: 0.13 (95% CI 0.05-0.29) and 0.70 (95% CI 0.57-0.80), respectively.CONCLUSION: The CSSS has a lower sensitivity and specificity in an elderly population presenting with syncope compared to previously validated data in young adults, particularly in elderly patients with previous history of mild cardiovascular disease. A modified CSSS may be needed to improve specificity and sensitivity in this population.
