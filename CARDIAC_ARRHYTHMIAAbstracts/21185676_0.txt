Aluminium (Al) is the most widely distributed metal in the environment. It is commonly used in daily life, which provides easy exposure to human. The exposure to this toxic metal occurs through air, food, and water. The clinical spectrum of poisoning varies depending on the dosage and duration of consumption. Acute exposure to Al is highly toxic to lungs, heart, and blood vessels causing pulmonary edema, shock, and arrhythmias. Chronic exposure to aluminium is associated with behavioral, neurologic, and hematologic changes. Some epidemiologic studies have shown poor performance in cognitive tests and a higher prevalence rate of neurologic symptoms for workers occupationally exposed to aluminium. Although there are several reports about ventricular tachycardia in case of acute poisoning, there is no report about chronic poisoning. In this report, we presented a 20-year-old man who had recurrent ventricular tachycardia.
