Introduction: Metastasis of uterine cervical carcinoma to the heart is uncommon and cases with metastasis to the right atrium are especially rare. This type of metastasis occurs in the epicardium and the myocardium in over 90% of cases with a heart metastatic tumor. Most cases of a metastatic tumor in the heart are found by chance during autopsy. Case report: We present the case of a patient with stage IIa uterine cervical carcinoma who visited our hospital with a chief complaint of arrhythmia 1.9 years after surgical treatment of carcinoma. CT and MRI showed that recurrent metastatic uterine cervical carcinoma had grown from the inferior vena cava upward into the right atrium. Conclusion: Although gynecological malignant tumors rarely metastasize to the heart, it is important to consider this possibility in patients with chest symptoms, and to make an early definite diagnosis and give appropriate treatment.
