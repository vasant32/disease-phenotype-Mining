Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in clinical practice and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. In view of an aging population, the prevalence and incidence of AF are on the rise and are expected to double in the coming decades, posing a huge economic burden on already strained resources. New innovative therapies such as pulmonary vein isolation and percutaneous closure of the left atrial appendage have emerged. The current applications of such therapies would not have been possible without the pivotal role of multimodality cardiovascular imaging. The role of echocardiography in guiding therapy has been extensively reviewed. However, there are new data in support of other complementary imaging modalities, mainly cardiac computed tomography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, which will be the focus of this review.
