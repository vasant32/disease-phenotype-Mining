Brugada syndrome (BS) is a rare genetically-based condition occurring usually in the third and fourth decade of human life, mainly developing in men (85%). It is manifested through permanent or periodic malignant ventricular arrhythmia leading to fainting, and consequently sudden cardiac death. Despite possessing great knowledge of the condition, implementation of cardioverter-defibrillator still remains the only effective way of treating malignant arrhythmia and of preventing sudden cardiac death. The following paper presents a case of a healthy nineteen-year-old man who was admitted to the Outpatient Cardiologic Center for a sport qualifying check-up. During examination, the ECG showed some features of Brugada syndrome and the patient was sent for further hospital diagnostics. During the aimaline provocative test the ECG revealed ST elevation up to 4mm in V1-V2 leads, whereas the electrophysiological examination with standard protocol and with right ventricular apex and right ventricular output aggressive protocol did not provoke any ventricular arrhythmia. The patient was qualified for preventive treatment with recommendation for regular check-up in an outpatient cardiologic center and with a total ban on extreme sport exercises.
