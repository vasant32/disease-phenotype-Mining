In order to quantify small molecules at the early stage of drug discovery, we developed a quantitation approach based on mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) without the use of a labeled compound. We describe a method intended to respond to the main challenges encountered in quantification through MALDI imaging dedicated to whole-body or single heterogeneous organ samples (brain, eye, liver). These include the high dependence of the detected signal on the matrix deposition, the MALDI ionization yield of specific target molecules, and lastly, the ion suppression effect on the tissue. To address these challenges, we based our approach on the use of a normalization factor called the TEC (Tissue Extinction Coefficient). This factor takes into account the ion suppression effect that is both tissue- and drug-specific. Through this protocol, the amount of drug per gram of tissue was determined, which in turn, was compared with other analytical techniques such as Liquid Chromatography-Mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
