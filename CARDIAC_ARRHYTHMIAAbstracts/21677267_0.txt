The response to myocardial ischemia is complex and involves the cardio-cardiac sympathetic reflex. Specifically, cardiac spinal (sympathetic) afferents are excited by ischemic metabolites and elicit an excitatory sympathetic reflex, which plays a major role in the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias. For example, brief myocardial ischemia leads to ATP release, which activates cardiac spinal afferents through stimulation of P2 receptors. Clinical work with patients and preclinical work with animals document that disruption of this reflex protects against ischemia-induced ventricular arrhythmias. However, the role of afferent signals in the initiation of sustained ventricular tachycardia has not been investigated. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that cardiac spinal deafferentation reduces the susceptibility to sustained ventricular tachycardia in adult (12-15 wk of age), conscious, male Sprague-Dawley rats. To test this hypothesis, the susceptibility to ventricular tachyarrhythmias produced by occlusion of the left main coronary artery was determined in two groups of conscious rats: 1) deafferentation (bilateral excision of the T1-T5 dorsal root ganglia) and 2) control (sham deafferentation). The ventricular arrhythmia threshold (VAT) was defined as the time from coronary occlusion to sustained ventricular tachycardia resulting in a reduction in arterial pressure. Results document a significantly higher VAT in the deafferentation group (7.0 ± 0.7 min) relative to control (4.3 ± 0.3 min) rats. The decreased susceptibility to tachyarrhythmias with deafferentation was associated with a reduced cardiac metabolic demand (lower rate-pressure product and ST segment elevation) during ischemia.
