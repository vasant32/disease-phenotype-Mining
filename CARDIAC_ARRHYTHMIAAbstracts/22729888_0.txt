The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of ibutilide on canine cardiac sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes (AVNs). For this purpose, 18 mongrel dogs were injected intravenously with ibutilide and the changes in heart rate, sinus node recovery time, and AVN were measured. Our data show that ibutilide administration caused significant suppression of the sinus atrial node, the peak response time was 20-30 min, and the heart rate was restored to pre-drug administration level. After receiving ibutilide, 1 animal had a 5 s sinus pause, and after 5 min of ibutilide administration, 1 dog showed 2:1 atrioventricular conduction. Therefore, it was concluded that ibutilide had a suppressive effect on the sinoatrial node and AVN.
