Ion transport processes are highly energy consuming. It is therefore critical to couple ion transport processes to the metabolic state of the cell. An important player in this coupling appears to be the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). This kinase becomes activated during conditions of cellular metabolic stress and is well-known for its role in promoting ATP-generating catabolic pathways while turning off ATP-utilizing anabolic pathways. Over the past decade AMPK has also emerged as a key regulator of ion channel activity as an increasing number of ion channels are reported to be either directly or indirectly regulated by the kinase. AMPK therefore provides a necessary link between cellular energy levels and ion channel activity.
