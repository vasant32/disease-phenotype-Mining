Oxidative stress remodels Ca(2+) signaling in cardiomyocytes, which promotes altered heart function in various heart diseases. Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was shown to be activated by oxidation, but whether and how CaMKII links oxidative stress to pathophysiological long-term changes in Ca(2+) signaling remain unknown. Here, we present evidence demonstrating the role of CaMKII in transient oxidative stress-induced long-term facilitation (LTF) of L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)) in rat cardiomyocytes. A 5-min exposure of 1mM H(2)O(2) induced an increase in I(Ca,L), and this increase was sustained for ~1h. The CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 fully reversed H(2)O(2)-induced LTF of I(Ca,L), indicating that sustained CaMKII activity underlies this oxidative stress-induced memory. Simultaneous inhibition of oxidation and autophosphorylation of CaMKII prevented the maintenance of LTF, suggesting that both mechanisms contribute to sustained CaMKII activity. We further found that sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release and mitochondrial ROS generation have critical roles in sustaining CaMKII activity via autophosphorylation- and oxidation-dependent mechanisms. Finally, we show that long-term remodeling of the cardiac action potential is induced by H(2)O(2) via CaMKII. In conclusion, CaMKII and mitochondria confer oxidative stress-induced pathological cellular memory that leads to cardiac arrhythmia.
