Minocycline has been shown to protect against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. This study investigated the effects of minocycline on ischemia-induced ventricular arrhythmias in rats. Anesthetized male rats were once treated with minocycline (45mg/kg, i.p.) 1h before ischemia in the absence and/or presence of 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-1(4H)-benzopyran-4-one hydrochloride (LY294002, 0.3mg/kg, i.v., a PI3K inhibitor) and 5-hydroxydecanoic acid [5-HD, 10mg/kg, i.v., a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels] which were once injected 10min before ischemia and then subjected to ischemia for 30min. Ventricular arrhythmias were assessed. L-type Ca(2+) current was measured by the patch-clamp technique. During the 30-minute ischemia, minocycline significantly reduced the incidence of ventricular fibrillation (VF) (P<0.05). The duration of VT+VF, the number of VT+VF episodes and the severity of arrhythmias were all significantly reduced by minocycline compared to those in myocardial ischemia group (P<0.05 for all). Administration of LY294002 or 5-HD abolished the protective effects of minocycline on VF incidence, the duration of VT+VF, the number of VT+VF episodes and the severity of arrhythmias (P<0.05 for all). In addition, minocycline inhibited L-type Ca(2+) currents of normal myocardial cell membrane in a dose-dependent manner. This study suggested that minocycline could attenuate ischemia-induced ventricular arrhythmias in rats in which PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, mitochondrial K(ATP) channels and L-type Ca(2+) channels may be involved.
