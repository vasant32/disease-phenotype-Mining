Most countries face high and increasing rates of cardiovascular disease. Each year, heart disease kills more Americans than cancer. Therefore, there has been a promising market for portable ECG equipment and it is increasing. To use portable ECG measuring devices, it is essential to define a suitable location for the measuring as we need to reduced electrode size and distance. This research proposes to study how the inter-electrode distance affects the signal and how the electrode pair should be placed on the chest in order to obtain a sufficiently reliable ECG signal to detect heart arrhythmias in any environment, such as home or work. Therefore, we developed a compact, portable patch type ambulatory ECG monitoring system, Heart Tracker, using a microprocessor for preliminary study of signal analysis. To optimize the electrode arrangement in wireless environment, we compared HT and standard 12 lead with changing electrode position.
