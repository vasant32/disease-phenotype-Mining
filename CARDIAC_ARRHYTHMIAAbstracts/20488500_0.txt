The aim of this study was to examine the pharmacokinetics of nicorandil, a hybrid of an adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel opener and a nitrate, and to estimate its clinical doses in dogs with mild mitral valve regurgitation (MR). Nicorandil (0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg) was administered orally to normal dogs and those with experimentally-induced MR, and its plasma concentrations were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography. Plasma concentrations increased dose-dependently after the administration of nicorandil, and were not different between normal dogs and those with MR. Similar to the effective plasma values obtained in cardiac disease in humans, the findings of this pharmacokinetic study may indicate that a dose of 0.3-1.0 mg/kg has the same effectiveness in dogs with cardiac dysfunction.
