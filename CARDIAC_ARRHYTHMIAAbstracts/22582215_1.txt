Cardiac sympathetic afferent reflex (CSAR) is involved in sympathetic activation. The present study was designed to investigate the contribution of enhanced CSAR to sympathetic activation in the early stage of diabetes and the involvement of AT(1) receptors in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Diabetes was induced by a single intravenous injection of streptozotocin in rats. Acute experiments were carried out under anesthesia after 3 wk. The CSAR was evaluated by the responses of renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) to epicardial application of capsaicin or bradykinin. Sympathetic activity and CSAR were enhanced in diabetic rats. Plasma norepinephrine and angiotensin II were increased, but the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) in the left ventricle wall was not significantly increased in diabetic rats. Pericardial injection of resiniferatoxin to desensitize cardiac afferents or PVN microinjection of lidocaine attenuated the CSAR and decreased the RSNA and MAP in diabetic rats. The AT(1) receptor expression in the PVN increased in diabetic rats. Angiotensin II in the PVN caused greater increases in the RSNA and MAP and enhancement in the CSAR in diabetic rats, which were abolished by the losartan pretreatment. Losartan decreased the RSNA and MAP and attenuated the CSAR in diabetic rats but not in control rats. These results indicate that the CSAR is enhanced in the early stage of diabetic rats, which contributes to the sympathetic activation. AT(1) receptors in the PVN are involved in the enhanced CSAR in diabetic rats.
