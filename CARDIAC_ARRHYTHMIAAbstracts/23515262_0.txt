Background- Prolonged P-wave duration, indicating atrial conduction delay, is a potent precursor of atrial fibrillation. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation development. We investigated the association of P-wave duration with OSA and its treatment. Methods and Results- We enrolled 80 consecutive men with normal sinus rhythms who underwent polysomnography, had no history of atrial fibrillation or ischemic heart disease, and no evidence of heart failure. Signal-averaged P-wave duration (SAPWD) was measured in all participants. Multivariable regression analysis showed that age, hypertension, and log-transformed apnea-hypopnea index were significantly and independently correlated with SAPWD. SAPWD was repeatedly measured after 1 month of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in 62 patients with moderate-to-severe OSA. As controls, 18 patients with moderate-to-severe OSA were enrolled. Their SAPWD was also measured at baseline and after 1 month without CPAP therapy. No significant change in SAPWD was found between baseline and after 1 month in the controls. However, SAPWD was significantly shortened after 1 month of CPAP therapy (from 137.5±8.6 to 129.7±8.5 ms; P<0.001), and the SAPWD change was significantly different in patients with CPAP therapy compared with controls (P<0.001). In addition, the SAPWD change in patients with CPAP therapy correlated inversely with nightly CPAP usage (r=-0.52; P<0.001). Conclusions- OSA severity was significantly associated with prolonged SAPWD. CPAP therapy significantly shortened SAPWD in patients with moderate-to-severe OSA. Thus, OSA may cause atrial conduction disturbances, leading to an increased risk of atrial fibrillation development, which may be modifiable by alleviating OSA with CPAP therapy.
