 BACKGROUND: To summarize the results of MAMI registration and compare them to other national and foreign records published. METHODS: Observational, prospective and multicenter study based on a wide source of data incoming from 50 Intensive Care Units in Spain during 15 years, from April 1996 to December 2010. Demographic, clinical, etiological and electrocardiographic (ECG) variables were collected before pacemaker implantation. Type of intervention, electrical measurement at implantation, model and serial number of devices and electrodes as well as early complications (before hospital discharge) were also recorded. RESULTS: During this period 31766 interventions have been reported: 24643 first implants (77.6%) and 7123 replacements (22.4). The total number of patients is lower than interventions because some of them were included as first implants and as replacements after years. In first implant the average age, clinical signs, ECG disorders and pacing modes were described. Data collected in device replacement interventions were average age, pacing modes and cause for replacement. 45% of implanted devices were endowed with rate control algorithm. In last 3 years increased to 82.4%. From 1996 to 2010 we have seen a decline in VVI(R) pacing mode in favor to DDD(R) mode. AAI(R) and VDD(R) modes have remained invariable. Finally, we show data on early complications and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: MAMI registration is a valid tool for recording the activity of pacemaker implantation. It showed variations and trends of pacing modes and algorithms along the years. Data is recorded separately for men and women so they can be compared.
