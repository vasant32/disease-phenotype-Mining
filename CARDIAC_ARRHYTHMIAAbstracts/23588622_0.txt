BACKGROUND: Changes in P wave duration (PWD) and P wave area (PWA) have been described following catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF). We hypothesize that video-assisted thoracoscopic pulmonary vein isolation (VATS-PVI) for AF results in decrease of PWD, PWA and P wave dispersion, which may resemble reverse electrical remodeling of the atrium after restoration of sinus rhythm. METHODS: VATS-PVI consisted of PVI and ganglionic plexus ablation in 29 patients (mean age, 59 ± 7 years; 23 males; 17 paroxysmal AF) and additional left atrial lesions in patients with persistent AF. PWD and PWA were measured in ECG lead II, aVF and V2 of ECGs during sinus rhythm before, directly after, and 6 months postprocedure. P wave dispersion was derived from the 12 lead ECG. RESULTS: Prior to VATS-PVI, PWD did not correlate with left atrial size and no difference in left atrial size was found between patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF (p = 0.27). Following VATS-PVI, PWD initially prolonged in all patients from 115 ± 4.6 ms to 131 ± 3.6 ms (p < 0.01) but shortened to 99 ± 3.2 ms after 6 months (p < 0.01). PWA was 5.60 ± 0.32 mV*ms at baseline, 6.44 ± 0.32 mV*ms post-VATS-PVI (P = NS), and 5.40 ± 0.28 mV*ms after 6 months (p = NS vs. baseline, p < 0.05 vs. post-VATS-PVI). P wave dispersion decreased in the persistent AF group from baseline 67 ± 3.3 to 64 ± 2.5 ms post-VATS-PVI (p = 0.30) and to 61 ± 3.4 ms after 6 months (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: PWD increases significantly directly after successful VATS-PVI in both groups. There was significant decrease in PWD after 6 months. Similarly, P wave dispersion decreased in the persistent group. These changes suggest an immediate procedure related effect, but the later changes may represent reverse electrical atrial remodeling following cessation of AF.
