Postoperative junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) in children undergoing cardiac surgery is a serious arrhythmia that is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. We present here a case of successful landiolol therapy for postoperative JET in a 3-month-old infant who underwent ventricular septal defect closure and right pulmonary artery plasty. His left ventricular function was poor postoperatively. The JET was refractory to amiodarone and caused severe hypotension, which was required cardiac massage. Continuous intravenous infusion of low-dose landiolol reduced the persistent JET rate immediately, and restored to sinus rhythm with stable hemodynamics.
