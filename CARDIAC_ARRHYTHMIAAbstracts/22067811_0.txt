 BACKGROUND: Many abortion providers use digoxin to induce fetal demise prior to dilation and evacuation (D&E). Our primary objective was to examine the frequency of infection and extramural delivery following digoxin use. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective single-cohort study. Inclusion criteria were all women between 18 and 24 weeks of estimated gestational age who received digoxin in preparation for D&E at our outpatient facility. We queried two electronic databases to collect data on the frequency of extramural delivery and the rate of perioperative infection. RESULTS: From January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2008, 4906 abortions were performed between 18 and 24 weeks of estimated gestation with digoxin injection administered as feticidal agent 1 day prior to D&E. Extramural delivery frequency was 0.30%, and infection frequency was 0.04%. There were no significant differences in the frequency of extramural deliveries across procedure year (p = .2), estimated gestational age (p = .3), race/ethnicity (p = .2) or maternal age (p = .3). CONCLUSION: Rates of extramural delivery and infection are acceptably low following digoxin use prior to scheduled D&E.
