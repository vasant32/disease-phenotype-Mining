 BACKGROUND: Atrial premature contractions (APCs) are well described to precede the initiation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (pAF). However, whether APC characteristics alter with progression of the arrhythmia is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the APC characteristics in terms of burden and relative coupling interval with progression of the AF disease process. METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients with pAF, 50 consecutive patients with persistent AF (perAF), and 25 age-matched controls underwent clinical review, transthoracic echocardiography, and ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring. After excluding 29 patients who had AF for the entire recording (n = 24) or unreliable recordings (n = 5), we analyzed data from 49 patients with pAF, 24 patients with perAF, and 23 healthy controls. All normal morphology R-R intervals with a >25% decrease in R-R coupling compared with the previous R-R interval (coupling interval index) were deemed APCs (n = 95,873). RESULTS: The median APC burden was higher in patients with pAF (2 [1-22] APCs/h; P = .004) and perAF (3 [1-6] APCs/h; P = .04) than in controls (1 [0-1] APCs/h) but was not different (P = .66) between the AF subgroups. Patients with pAF had a distinct increase in ectopy burden after 7 PM and elevation throughout the night (P = .002) in comparison with a blunted and complementary temporal response in the perAF cohort (P = .01). Patients with pAF demonstrated a greater proportion of shortly coupled APCs (29% [13-45]; P = .04) compared with persistent arrhythmia (17% [5-29]). CONCLUSIONS: "Real-life" atrial trigger statistics of APC burden, timing, and diurnal rhythms track the transition from a trigger-based, autonomically sensitive paroxysmal arrhythmia to a more substrate-based persistent disease.
