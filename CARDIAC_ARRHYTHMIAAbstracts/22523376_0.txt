 AIMS: Cardiac transplantation (CTX) is an effective treatment for end-stage heart disease. Cardiac arrhythmias are increasingly recognized and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We aim to describe the clinical and electrophysiological characteristics of patients with atrial arrhythmias occurring late after CTX. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixteen patients with prior CTX who presented with late atrial arrhythmias for electrophysiological studies (EPS) were identified at two cardiac transplant centres. Among 859 patients, 16 (mean age 52 ± 14 years, 11 of 16 were men) patients underwent EPS for atrial arrhythmias presenting 8.6 ± 5.7 years following CTX. Among 16 patients, 14 underwent cardiac alone and 2 included lung transplantation. There were no cases of cardiac rejection. Arrhythmias were due to counterclockwise cavotricuspid-dependent atrial flutter (AFL) in 10 of 16, atrial tachycardia (AT) in 6 (1 patient had AFL and AT), and 1 due to atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia. Recipient-donor atrial electrical connection was seen in two of six AT and in no cases of AFL. In two cases, a focal AT was mapped to the remnant atrium conducting 2 : 1 or at variable block to the donor atrium. In four cases a focal/micro re-entrant AT originated within the vicinity of the interatrial suture scar. All cases were successfully ablated with radiofrequency energy; however, one case of AFL required a repeat ablation. Patients remained free of arrhythmia at 34 ± 15 months post-ablation. CONCLUSION: Typical AFL and AT are the most frequent supraventricular arrhythmias occurring late following CTX. Focal ATs may originate in low-voltage or border zones immediately adjacent to the atrio-atrial anastomosis. Radiofrequency ablation is an effective treatment strategy with high long-term success.
