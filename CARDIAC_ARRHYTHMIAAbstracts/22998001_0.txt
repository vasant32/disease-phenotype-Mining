 AIM: Atrial septal aneurysm (ASA) is a risk factor for arterial embolism. Despite prior reports concerning paradoxical embolism through a patent foramen ovale, atrial dysfunction and atrial arrhythmias might represent an additional mechanism for arterial embolism.The aim of this study was to evaluate right and left atrial appendage contractilty in patients with ASA. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 30 patients with ASA (10 males/20 females, mean age 50.2 +/- 15.3 years) and 30 controls (12 males/ 18 females, mean age 47.7 +/- 10 years) were included. Conventional transthoracic and multiplane transoesophageal echocardiography were performed in patient and control groups. Flow and myocardial velocity were measured in both atrial appendages. Baseline characteristics of both groups were comparable. Flow velocity and myocardial contraction velocity in both atrial appendages were significantly lower in ASA patients. Compared to the control group, patients with ASA had a larger length, base and area of both appendages. CONCLUSION: In ASA patients right and left atrial appendage function are impaired. Biatrial dysfunction may cause arrhythmia and thromboembolism.
