Metoprolol is widely used in cardiology for the treatment of hypertension and arrhythmia. The neuropsychiatric adverse reactions associated with the use of beta-blockers are relatively uncommon, but sometimes take place when poisoning or overdosing on elderly patients. We present a case of a young patient with low-dose metoprolol which induced acute delirium and in whom the symptoms disappeared within 3 days after metoprolol was ceased. The results illustrated that the neuropsychiatric adverse reactions of metoprolol could be developed not only in elderly patients but also in young patients, which has great significance to direct physicians in their clinical practice.
