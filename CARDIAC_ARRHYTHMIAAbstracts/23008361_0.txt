The authors report about a patient who was admitted after developing nausea, vomiting, change in vision and lethargy. She was on digoxin 250 mcg once daily among all her other medications in the wake of a recent stroke that was accompanied by atrial fibrillation (AF). Her digitalis levels shortly before and on admission were 3.4 and 2.9 ng/ml, respectively. Her admission rhythm was slowly conducted AF at an average of 35 bpm. After a careful assessment by the cardiology consultant in charge, she received Digibind infusion for a chronic digitalis toxicity with the digoxin immune Fab dose based on the formula recommended in the product literature.(3) A few days observation on the ward ensured that her resting heart rate rose to 65 bpm and that she did not need a pacemaker for a slow AF. Her functional status remained reasonably good as she enjoyed a satisfactory recovery postthrombolysis for her recent stroke.
