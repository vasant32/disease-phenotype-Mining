A case of a 48-year-old male is described with recurrent paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia originating near the region of the posterior fascicle, as an initial presentation of a primary norepinephrine producing pheochromocytoma, including reversible catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy. The ventricular arrhythmia was terminated by procainamide and labetalol. After adrenalectomy no recurrent ventricular arrhythmia was observed.
