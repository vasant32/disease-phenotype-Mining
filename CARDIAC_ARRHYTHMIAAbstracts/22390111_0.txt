A 38 year old gentleman presented with fever and right hypochondrial pain. On further evaluation he was detected to have an amoebic liver abscess (ALA) in the right lobe of the liver. The abscess yielded anchovy sauce pus on percutaneous drainage. Following the percutaneous drainage the patient developed tachycardia. Electrocardiogram revealed atrial flutter with rapid ventricular rate and ST elevation in all leads suggestive of pericarditis. The atrial flutter was reverted to sinus rhythm by cardioversion. The patient then had an uncomplicated convalescence. Amoebic pericarditis, though rare, is a serious complication of amoebic liver abscess. Pericardial complications are usually seen with left lobe liver abscess due to its proximity. Both pericarditis and cardiac arrhythmias due to amoebic liver abscess especially from right lobe are very rare.
