Ventricular arrhythmias are common in the setting of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDCM). However, the characterization of the substrate and mechanism of epicardial ventricular tachycardia (VT) associated with NIDCM is limited, and to the best of our knowledge VT due to myocardial reentry within the right ventricular (RV) epicardium associated with NIDCM has not been reported. We report a case of RV epicardial VT provoked by RV pacing that was successfully ablated.
