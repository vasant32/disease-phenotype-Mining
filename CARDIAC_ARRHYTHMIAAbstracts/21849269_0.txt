This report describes the use of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in a young German shepherd dog afflicted with inherited ventricular arrhythmias. Proper generator and lead placement was necessary for successful termination of ventricular fibrillation during device testing at the time of implantation. The risks of inappropriate therapy triggered by sinus tachycardia and oversensing of the T wave were controlled by extensive programming of the device. Following spontaneous resolution of the arrhythmia and due to the development of sepsis associated with the device, the ICD was successfully removed.
