 BACKGROUND: S100A12, a calgranulin family protein released from white blood cells, is involved in inflammatory cardiovascular disease. It was hypothesized that the plasma level of S100A12 can be used to predict outcome in patients with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD). The purpose of this study was to clarify the clinical significance of S100A12 in patients with stable CAD. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 652 patients with stable CAD were studied. All patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and successful revascularization. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were defined as a composite of events of CHF, recurrence of angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, critical arrhythmia, intervention to peripheral arteries and cardiac death. The mean follow-up period was 973Â±639 days. MACE occurred in 108 patients (16.6%). Plasma S100A12 level had a significant positive correlation with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) level. On Kaplan-Meier curve analysis the incidence of MACE was significantly different among S100A12 quartiles (P=0.026). The highest S100A12 quartile (Q4) had a significantly higher MACE rate than the lowest quartile (Q1) (P=0.002). In contrast, hs-CRP was not significant for predicting MACE in the present subjects (P=0.074). A Cox proportional hazard model showed that S100A12 was an independent factor for predicting MACE in multivariate models. CONCLUSIONS: S100A12 could be a novel biomarker for predicting cardiovascular events for predicting MACE in patients with stable CAD.
