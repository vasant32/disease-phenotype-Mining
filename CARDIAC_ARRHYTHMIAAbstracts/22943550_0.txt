In order to assess cardiac tolerance of halofantrine in children, we studied, retrospectively, 15 non complicated falciparum malaria cases treated with halofantrine, and focused on the effect on ventricular repolarisation. Our data showed that halofantrine can produce a moderate QTc  prolongation without any life-threatening arrhythmia. As long as contraindications of the drug are respected, this treatment should be considered as a therapeutical option in young children presenting with non complicated falciparum malaria.
