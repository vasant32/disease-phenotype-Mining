Cocaine has become one of the most commonly abused recreational drugs, resulting in a significantly increased number of visits to the emergency department due to the acute symptoms caused by its intake. The acute onset of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, stroke, and kidney and spleen infarction, has been described in association with cocaine use, but aortic thrombosis has rarely been studied in this context. We report a case of acute aortoiliac thrombosis in a young male patient with no underlying medical records.
