 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Uncoupling of cardiac gap junction channels is an important arrhythmogenic mechanism in ischemia/reperfusion. Antiarrhythmic peptide AAP10 (H-Gly-Ala-Gly-Hyp-Pro-Tyr-CONH(2)) has been shown to prevent acidosis-induced uncoupling and ischemia-related increase in dispersion. Previous structure-effect investigations and subsequent computer modeling studies indicated that the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine may exert similar effects as AAP10. METHODS: We assessed the binding of (14)C-AAP10 to membranes of rabbit cardiac ventricles and its displacement with desipramine in a classical radioligand binding and competition study. Gap junction currents were measured between isolated pairs of human atrial cardiomyocytes under normal and acidotic (pH 6.3) conditions with or without 1 μmol/l desipramine using dual whole-cell voltage clamp. The effect of 1 μmol/l desipramine was assessed in isolated rabbit hearts (Langendorff technique) undergoing local ischemia by coronary occlusion with 256-channel electrophysiological mapping and subsequent analysis of connexin43 (Cx43) expression, phosphorylation (Western blot), and subcellular localization (immunohistology). RESULTS: We found saturable (14)C-AAP10 binding to cardiac membranes (K                   (D), 0.29 ± 0.11 nmol/l; B                   (max), 42.5 ± 7.2 pmol/mg) which could be displaced by desipramine with a K                   (D.High) = 0.14 μmol/l and a K                   (D.Low) = 22 μmol/l. Acidosis reduced the gap junction conductance in human cardiomyocyte pairs from 24.1 ± 4.7 to 11.5 ± 2.5 nS, which could be significantly reversed by desipramine (26.6 ± 4.8 nS). In isolated hearts, ischemia resulted in significantly increased dispersion of activation-recovery intervals, loss of membrane Cx43, and dephosphorylation of Cx43, which all could be prevented by desipramine. CONCLUSION: Desipramine seems to prevent the uncoupling of cardiac gap junctions and ischemia-related increase in dispersion.
