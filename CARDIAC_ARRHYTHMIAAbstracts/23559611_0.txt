AIMS: Pulmonary vein ganglia (PVG) are targets for atrial fibrillation ablation. However, the functional relevance of PVG to the normal heart rhythm remains unclear. Our aim was to investigate whether PVG can modulate sinoatrial node (SAN) function.Methods and Results49 C57BL and 7 Connexin40(+/EGFP) mice were studied. We used tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH) and choline-acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunofluorescence labeling to characterize adrenergic and cholinergic neural elements. PVG projected postganglionic nerves to the SAN which entered the SAN as an extensive, mesh-like neural network. PVG neurons were adrenergic, cholinergic and biphenotypic. Histochemical characterization of 2 human embryonic hearts showed similarities between mouse and human neuroanatomy: direct neural communications between PVG and SAN. In Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts PVG were stimulated using 200-2000&emsp14;ms trains of pulses (300&emsp14;µs, 400&emsp14;µA, 200&emsp14;Hz). PVG stimulation caused an initial heart rate (HR) slowing (36±9%) followed by acceleration. PVG stimulation in the presence of propranolol caused HR slowing (43±13%) that was sustained over 20 beats. PVG stimulation with atropine progressively increased HR. Time-course effects were enhanced with 1000 and 2000&emsp14;ms trains (P<0.05 vs 200&emsp14;ms). In optical mapping PVG stimulation shifted the origin of SAN discharges. In 5 paroxysmal AF patients undergoing PV ablation, application of radiofrequency energy to the PVG area during sinus rhythm produced a decrease in heart rate similar to that observed in isolated mouse hearts. CONCLUSIONS: PVG have functional and anatomical biphenotypic characteristics. They can have significant effects on the electrophysiological control of the SAN.
