Sudden death is common in patients with congenital coronary artery anomalies mainly when the left main coronary artery originates from the right coronary sinus. Ventricular fibrillation in these patients is irreversible unless defibrillation can be rapidly performed. We describe a 57-year-old male with an anomalous origin of circumflex and the left anterior descending coronary arteries from the right coronary sinus. He developed two episodes of ventricular fibrillation that terminated spontaneously, 10 hours after percutaneous revascularization of the circumflex coronary artery. Computed tomography angiography, in addition to confirming the anomalous origin of the coronary arteries, showed a muscle bridge over the midportion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. This is the first report of spontaneous termination of ventricular fibrillation in a patient with congenital anomaly of the coronary arteries.
