 BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common supraventricular arrhythmia in the clinical practice, being the subject of intensive research. METHODS: The present work introduces two different Wavelet Transform (WT) applications to electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of patients in AF. The first one predicts spontaneous termination of paroxysmal AF (PAF), whereas the second one deals with the prediction of electrical cardioversion (ECV) outcome in persistent AF patients. In both cases, the central tendency measure (CTM) from the first differences scatter plot was applied to the AF wavelet decomposition. In this way, the wavelet coefficients vector CTM associated to the AF frequency scale was used to assess how atrial fibrillatory (f) waves variability can be related to AF events. RESULTS: Structural changes into the f waves can be assessed by combining WT and CTM to reflect atrial activity organization variation. This fact can be used to predict organization-related events in AF. To this respect, results in the prediction of PAF termination regarding sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 100%, 91.67% and 96%, respectively. On the other hand, for ECV outcome prediction, 82.93% sensitivity, 90.91% specificity and 85.71% accuracy were obtained. Hence, CTM has reached the highest diagnostic ability as a single predictor published to date. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that CTM can be considered as a promising tool to characterize non-invasive AF signals. In this sense, therapeutic interventions for the treatment of paroxysmal and persistent AF patients could be improved, thus, avoiding useless procedures and minimizing risks.
