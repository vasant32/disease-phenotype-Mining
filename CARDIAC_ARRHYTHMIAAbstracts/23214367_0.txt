Heart rate turbulence (HRT) is a new electrocardiographic parameter used in human medicine to predict the possibility of death in patients with cardiac diseases. There is no information about HRT in healthy dogs and those with cardiac diseases. The aim of the present study was to compare the HRT in healthy Boxers dogs with Boxers with mild and moderate subaortic stenosis (SAS), to disclose the relationship between HRT and specific echocardiographic parameters and to evaluate if HRT can be used as a prognostic value in dogs with aortic stenosis. The study revealed significantly lower values of turbulence onset (TO) and turbulence slope (TS) HRT dogs with SAS (TO = -0.76 +/- 2.6, TS = 7.1 +/- 3.21) in compared with healthy dogs (TO = -7.45 +/- 9.72, TS = 14.33 +/- 8.76). TO values correlated with the left ventricular mass (LVM)/body mass factor (r = 0,32; p = 0.048). Based on the results obtained it can be stated that dogs with SAS have a compromised baroreceptor response, which can influence the mortality of the animals with described cardiac defect.
