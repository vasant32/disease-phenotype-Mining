 CONTEXT: Patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease (cCHD) are prone to develop frequent brain abscesses. Surgery for these abscesses is often limited to aspiration under local anesthesia because excision under general anesthesia (GA) is considered a riskier option. Perioperative hemodynamic instability, cyanotic spells, coagulation defects, electrolyte and acid base imbalance, and sudden cardiac arrest are among the major anesthetic concerns. Most of our current knowledge in this area has been gained from a neurosurgical standpoint while there is a paucity of corresponding anesthesia literature. AIMS: To highlight the anesthesia issues involved in cCHD children undergoing brain abscess excision under GA. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Retrospective study of our institutional experience over a 5 year period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of all the children with cCHD who underwent brain abscess surgery from January 2005 to December 2009, only 4 were operated under GA. Surgery was done after correcting fever, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, coagulopathy and acid-base abnormalities, and taking appropriate intraoperative steps to maintain hemodynamic stability and prevent cyanotic spells and arrhythmias. RESULTS: All 4 patients had a successful abscess excision though with varying degrees of intraoperative problems. There was one death, on postoperative day 34, due to septicemia. CONCLUSIONS: Brain abscess excision under GA in children of cCHD can be safely carried out with proper planning and attention to detail.
