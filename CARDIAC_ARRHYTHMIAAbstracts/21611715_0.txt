Cardiopulmonary arrest refers to cessation of clinically detectable cardiac activity. In children, it usually results from progression of shock, respiratory failure or cardiac dysrhythmia. Early recognition and timely interventions in above group of patients is the key to prevent progression to cardiac arrest. The goal of resuscitation is to urgently re-establish oxygenation of vital organs by attention to Airway, Breathing and Circulation. Measures to restore airway patency include positioning, suctioning, continuous positive airway pressure, relieving a foreign-body airway obstruction and, endotracheal intubation, tracheotomy or laryngeal mask airway. Breathing is supported with O(2) and if needed, bag-mask ventilation, or endotracheal intubation and ventilation. Patients with absent or feeble central pulse are given cardiac compressions (CPR) at a rate of 100/ min synchronized with ventilation. In sudden witnessed collapse, immediate defibrillation is warranted, followed by CPR and administration of drugs. In unwitnessed collapse, CPR is performed for five cycles or 2 min before defibrillation. In patients with shock, a venous or an intraosseous access is rapidly established to administer 20 ml/kg saline bolus. Supraventricular tachycardia is treated with vagal maneuvers and adenosine, if the patient is stable and with synchronized cardioversion, if unstable. Ventricular tachycardia is treated with amiodarone or lidocaine, if stable, and cardioversion if unstable or if drugs fail. Ventricular fibrillation needs defibrillation. Aggressive supportive care is needed during the post-resuscitation phase. There is no definite marker to determine futility of CPR. Short duration of arrest, early initiation of CPR, hypothermia as the cause of arrest, and in-hospital arrest have better prognosis.
