Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia and is             a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have established genetic             defects as a risk factor for AF in a minority of patients. However, AF is of substantial             genetic heterogeneity and the molecular determinants for AF in a majority of cases             remain unclear. In this study, the entire coding sequence and splice junctions             of GATA4, which encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor essential for cardiogenesis,             were sequenced in 160 unrelated patients with lone AF. A total of 200 unrelated             ethnically matched healthy individuals were used as controls. The available relatives             of the patient carrying an identified mutation were genotyped. The functional             characteristics of the mutant GATA4 were analyzed using a luciferase reporter             assay system. As a result, two novel heterozygous GATA4 mutations of p.G16C and             p.H28D, were identified in 2 unrelated families with AF, respectively, which co-segregated             with AF in each family with complete penetrance. Functional analysis demonstrated             that the mutations of GATA4 were associated with a significantly decreased transcriptional             activity. The findings expand the mutation spectrum of GATA4 linked to AF and             provide novel insight into the molecular mechanism involved in the pathogenesis             of AF.
