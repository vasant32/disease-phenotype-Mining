Cardiac amyloid deposition in FMF may cause increased QT dispersion (QTd), a marker for cardiac arrhythmias. The aim of this study was to further evaluate repolarization dispersion in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) with amyloidosis. Findings on 12-lead electrocardiography were compared between 18 patients with FMF-amyloidosis and 18 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Repolarization and dispersion parameters were computed with designated computer software, and results of the 5 beats were subsequently averaged. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups as to average corrected QT interval length, average QTd interval, average QT corrected dispersion, or QT dispersion ratio. JT dispersion and JT corrected dispersion were also similar in both groups. In conclusion, patients with FMF-amyloidosis seem to have QT and JT dispersion parameters similar to those of healthy subjects. Future research and longer follow-ups should be conducted in order to evaluate the prognostic importance of repolarization dispersion parameters in amyloidosis of FMF.
