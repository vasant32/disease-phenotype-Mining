Oxidative stress results from damage to tissues caused by free radicals and is increased by exercise. Peroxiredoxins (PRXs) maintain the cellular reducing environment by scavenging intracellular hydrogen peroxide. It has been recently noted that physical exercise has a positive effect on the PRX system, exerting a protective effect against oxidative stress-induced damage. However, other compounds, such as sestrins (SESNs), a stress-inducible protein family with antioxidant properties, should also be considered in the function of PRXs. SESNs are clearly involved in the regeneration process of PRXs and therefore may also be modulated by physical exercise. In addition, SESNs are clearly involved in TOR, AMPK, p53, FoxO, and PRXs signaling pathways. The aforementioned pathways are implicated in aging processes by inducing an increased resistance to subsequent stress, thus delaying age-related changes, such as sarcopenia and frailty, and consequently promoting longevity. Likewise, exercise also modulates these pathways. In fact, exercise is one of the most important recommended strategies to prevent sarcopenia and frailty, increase longevity, and improve health in the elderly. Loss of SESNs can cause several chronic pathologies, such as fat accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmia, and/or muscle degeneration. Accordingly, physical inactivity leads to accumulation of visceral fat and consequently the activation of a network of inflammatory pathways, which promote development of insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration, and tumor growth. To date, the SESNs-exercise relationship has not been explored. However, this emerging family of stress proteins may be part of the redox-based adaptive response to exercise. J. Cell. Physiol.
