Similar degree of glycemia (28-31 mmol/liter) and similar mortality (37-42%) were revealed in August rats exhibiting enhanced activity of NO system and in Wistar rats 3 weeks after alloxan treatment. Under conditions of myocardial ischemia caused by 10-min coronary artery ligation, the intensity of arrhythmias did not differ from the control in Wistar rats with diabetes mellitus and increased in August rats. Under conditions of reperfusion, diabetes produced an antiarrhythmic effect in Wistar rats and did not affect arrhythmia in August rats. Plasma concentrations of nitrates and nitrites in Wistar and August rats increased by 82 and 143%, respectively, compared to the control. The level of hemoxygenase-1 (hsp32) in the myocardium remained unchanged in Wistar rats and decreased by 26% in August rats. Thus, the absence of antiarrhythmic effect of acute diabetes in August rats is probably related to elevated NO content and reduced antioxidant activity.
