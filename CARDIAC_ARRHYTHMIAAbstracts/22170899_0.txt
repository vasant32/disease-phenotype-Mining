A 34-year-old woman presented with idiopathic premature ventricular complex (PVC) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) originating from the area called the left ventricular summit. Radiofrequency (RF) application both through the coronary sinus and to the epicardial surface transiently suppressed the VT/PVC. Radiofrequency with sufficient energy was only applicable from the endocardial site, and the VT/PVC was successfully eliminated.
