Current myocardial perfusion MRI acquisitions are performed with a saturation recovery sequence, in large part to minimize sensitivity to arrhythmia. A new approach is proposed here where the images are acquired ungated at steady state without use of a saturation pulse. The data are acquired continuously and reach steady state after the first few images. A confluence of advances has made this new paradigm of an ungated steady-state acquisition possible-very rapid undersampled readouts with new reconstruction technologies permit enough measurements that continuous acquisition becomes a feasible approach. Gating can be applied retrospectively from a logged electrocardiogram (ECG) or with self-gating methods. In this work, simulations and measurements in a concentration phantom are used to demonstrate that similar contrast and signal can be obtained with the standard saturation recovery and the proposed spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) acquisition. Specifically, for a flip angle of 14Â° and a saturation recovery time of 80 ms, similar signals are acquired over a range of T(1) s that reflect realistic myocardial tissue concentrations. Preliminary results in one subject are presented to show the potential of this new approach. The method may allow for cine cardiac perfusion and more signal-to-noise ratio-efficient acquisitions.
