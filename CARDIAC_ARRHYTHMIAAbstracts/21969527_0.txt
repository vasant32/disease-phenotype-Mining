A rarely reported complication of pacemaker lead extraction is embolization of the pulmonary vasculature by a fragmented lead tip. The tip fractured and migrated to the right pulmonary artery during the extraction, and it was successfully retrieved percutaneously. Percutaneous retrieval is an important treatment option of an embolized fragmented lead tip as it could sometimes lead to disastrous complications.
