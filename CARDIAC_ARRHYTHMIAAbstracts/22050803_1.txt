Facemask ventilation has been associated with the development of postoperative nausea and vomiting, increasing the risk of tracheal aspiration; development of gastric distension that further impairs alveolar ventilation; perforation of gastric and duodenal ulcers; development of pneumothorax; extrabronchial air dissection; and development of cardiac dysrhythmias, including bradycardia from indirect vagal nerve stimulation. An unusual complication that occurred during prolonged facemask ventilation is presented: development of a pseudo-obstruction of the intrathoracic airway due to the presence of entrained esophageal air.
