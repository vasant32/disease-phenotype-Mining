Reduced vagal activity is associated with increased risk for life-threatening arrhythmia during myocardial ischemia (MI); conversely, the increase in vagal tone may provide protective effect against ventricular arrhythmias. In fact, vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) exerted an anti-arrhythmic effect by preserving connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein in ventricles, in a rat model of MI. We investigated the effects of VNS on ventricular tachyarrhythmia during acute MI and the expression of Cx43 in aged rats. Both adult (3-4 months) and aged (â‰¥ 24 months) male rats were subjected to ischemia of 30 min. VNS was applied before ischemia either alone or in combination with atropine (0.5 mg/kg) or carbenoxolone, a gap junction inhibitor (10 mg/kg). During the 30-min ischemia, the incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) was higher in aged rats compared with adult rats. VNS significantly suppressed VT and VF in adult rats and these effects were eliminated by atropine or carbenoxolone. In contrast, VNS did not suppress VT and VF in the aged rats. Moreover, ischemia did not change the expression levels of total Cx43 protein in adult and aged rat ventricles. However, the expression level of total Cx43 protein was two times lower in sham-operated aged rats than that in sham-operated adult rats. Thus, in aged rats, loss of anti-arrhythmic effect of VNS is associated with reduced expression of Cx43 protein. These findings suggest that Cx43 may be an important target for inhibiting ischemia-induced VT in adult patients but not in aged patients.
