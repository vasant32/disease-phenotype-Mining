In patients with structural heart disease, ventricular tachycardia (VT) worsens the clinical condition and may severely affect the short- and long-term prognosis. Several therapeutic options can be considered for the management of this arrhythmia. Among others, catheter ablation, a closed-chest therapy, can prevent arrhythmia recurrences by abolishing the arrhythmogenic substrate. Over the last two decades, different techniques have been developed for an effective approach to both tolerated and untolerated VTs. The clinical outcome of patients undergoing ablation has been evaluated in multiple studies. This editorial gives an overview of the role, methodology, clinical outcome and innovative approaches in catheter ablation of VT.
