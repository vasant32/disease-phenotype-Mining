Cardiac fibromas are rare intracardiac neoplasms but represent the most common resectable tumours of childhood. They can remain asymptomatic for extended periods of time but a pertinent and unpredictable risk of sudden cardiac death and fatal ventricular arrhythmia always exists even in asymptomatic patients. We report a case of an asymptomatic two month-old with cardiac fibroma who presented with a ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest. Here, we discuss management of cardiac fibroma in the context of occurrence of sudden VT.
