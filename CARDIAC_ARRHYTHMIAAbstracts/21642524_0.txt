Dentists are expected to deliver safe and pain-free dental procedures after they graduate from dental school. This includes using local anesthetics and sedative drugs that may be associated with side effects and complications that can lead to crisis situations. This study postulated that teaching medical crisis management to dental residents and assistants using human patient simulation (HPS) would improve their confidence in managing crisis situations in the real world. Four medical crisis scenarios were designed and programmed into a pediatric simulator. The scenarios included anaphylaxis, laryngospasm during procedural sedation, sedative medication overdose, and multiple drug interaction with cardiac arrhythmia. The simulation room was outfitted with an authentic dental operatory and emergency equipment to enhance the realism. One first-or second-year pediatric dentistry resident and a staff dental assistant were assigned as a team to participate in each ten-minute scenario followed by a debriefing session. At the end of the sessions, the participants completed an anonymous survey regarding the simulation experience. There were a total of twenty-four participants, 91.7 percent of whom felt that HPS was a good tool for learning medical crisis and that they will be more confident in managing a similar situation in the dental office after this experience. A majority of the participants felt that using HPS as a tool to teach crisis management is an acceptable and valuable technique to help improve their confidence in managing crisis situations that may occur in dental offices.
