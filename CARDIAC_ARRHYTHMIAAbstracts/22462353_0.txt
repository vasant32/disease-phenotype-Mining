 INTRODUCTION: Brugada syndrome is an arrhythmogenic disease characterized by coved ST segment elevation and J point elevation of at least 2 mm in at least two of the right precordial ECG leads (V1-3) and ventricular arrhythmias, syncope, and sudden death. Risk stratifications of patients with Brugada electrocardiogram are being strongly debated. CASE OUTLINE: A 23-year-old man was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit of the Clinical Centre "Bezanijska kosa" due to weakness, fatigue and chest discomfort. The patient suffered from fainting and palpitations. There was a family history of paternal sudden death at 36 years. Electrocardiogram showed a coved ST segment elevation of 4 mm in leads V1 and V2, recognised as spontaneous type 1 Brugada pattern. Laboratory investigations revealed normal serum cardiac troponin T and serum potassium, and absence of inflammation signs. Echocardiographic finding was normal, except for a mild enlargement of the right atrium and ventricle. The diagnosis of Brugada syndrome was made by Brugada-type 1 electrocardiogram and the family history of sudden death <45 years. The patient was considered as a high risk, because of pre-syncope and palpitations. He underwent ICD implantation (Medtronic MaximoVR7232Cx) using the standard procedure. After implantation, noninvasive electrophysiology study was done and demonstrated inducible VF that was interrupted with the second 35 JDC shock. The patient was discharged in stable condition with beta-blocker therapy. After a year of pacemaker check-ups, there were no either VT/ VF events or ICD therapy. CONCLUSION: Clinical presentation is the most important parameter in risk stratification of patients with Brugada electrocardiogram and Brugada syndrome.
