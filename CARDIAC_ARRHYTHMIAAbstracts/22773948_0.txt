Brugada syndrome (BrS) is associated with ventricular tachycardia originating particularly in the right ventricle (RV). We explore electrophysiological features predisposing to such arrhythmic tendency and their possible RV localization in a heterozygotic Scn5a+/- murine model. Na(v)1.5 mRNA and protein expression were lower in Scn5a+/- than wild-type (WT), with a further reduction in the RV compared with the left ventricle (LV). RVs showed higher expression levels of K(v)4.2, K(v)4.3 and KChIP2 in both Scn5a+/- and WT. Action potential upstroke velocity and maximum Na(+) current (I(Na)) density were correspondingly decreased in Scn5a+/-, with a further reduction in the RV. The voltage dependence of inactivation was shifted to more negative values in Scn5a+/-. These findings are predictive of a localized depolarization abnormality leading to slowed conduction. Persistent Na(+) current (I(pNa)) density was decreased in a similar pattern to I(Na). RV transient outward current (I(to)) density was greater than LV in both WT and Scn5a+/-, and had larger time constants of inactivation. These findings were also consistent with the observation that AP durations were smallest in the RV of Scn5a+/-, fulfilling predictions of an increased heterogeneity of repolarization as an additional possible electrophysiological mechanism for arrhythmogenesis in BrS.
