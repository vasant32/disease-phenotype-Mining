This is a case of atrial tachycardia 2 years after pulmonary transplantation. After excluding right atrial involvement, tachycardia origin was located in a scar region medial to the anastomosis of the left inferior pulmonary donor vein. Tachycardia mechanism was microreentry. Noninvasive electrocardiographic mapping performed before the ablation procedure matched with results of invasive Carto mapping and predicted both tachycardia mechanism and origin. We discuss arrhythmia mechanism found after pulmonary transplantation and benefit of noninvasive electrocardiographic mapping for procedure planning.
