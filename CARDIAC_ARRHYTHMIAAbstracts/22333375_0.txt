Echinococcus granulosus is a common infestation in sheep and cattle raising countries. Although it is typically encountered in liver and lung, rare cardiac involvement of this infestation has very important clinical complications such as heart failure, valve regurgitation, pericardial effusion-tamponade and arrhythmia. In addition, pericardial infestation is an extremely rare condition of Echinococcus granulosus. Here, we report a case of recurrent pericardial hydatid cyst presenting exertional dyspnea, palpitation and presyncope attacks in a 72-year-old man. The diagnosis of recurrent pericardial hydatid cyst was made by transthoracic echocardiography, computed tomography and surgical history.
