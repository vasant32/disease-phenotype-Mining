 OBJECTIVES: We aimed to observe the relationship of the metabolic syndrome and proarrythmogenic ECG parameters and to evaluate a possible correlation of these parameters to the metabolic syndrome score in patients without overt diabetes mellitus. METHODS: The study population consisted of 142 patients with the metabolic syndrome and 170 age- and gender-matched control subjects. In the ECG recordings, resting heart rate, QRS duration, corrected QT duration and corrected QT dispersion were measured. Patients were classified into three groups based on number of fulfilled metabolic syndrome criteria: group 1 (three metabolic syndrome criteria), group 2 (four metabolic syndrome criteria) and group 3 (five metabolic syndrome criteria). RESULTS: Patients with the metabolic syndrome had a higher increased resting heart rate, QTcd, prolonged QRS and QTc duration. Resting heart rate increases significantly parallel to the increase in the metabolic syndrome score across the groups, whilst QRS duration remained unchanged. QTc duration and QTc dispersion were significantly higher in groups 2 and 3 when compared to group 1. However, no significant differences were observed between groups 2 and 3. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that the metabolic syndrome and its score related with increased resting heart rate and prolonged repolarization durations in patiens without overt diabetes mellitus. These pro arrhythmogenic parameters could be used in the development of risk stratification schemes for sudden cardiac death in patients with the metabolic syndrome.
