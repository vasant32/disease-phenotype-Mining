Purpose There may be an increase in the risk of atrial arrhythmia due to left atrial enlargement and the influence on conduction system in acute rheumatic fever. The aim of this study is to investigate atrial electromechanical delay and P-wave dispersion in patients with acute rheumatic fever. Patients A total of 48 patients diagnosed with acute rheumatic fever and 40 volunteers of similar age, sex, and body mass index were included in the study. The study groups were compared for M-mode echocardiographic parameters, interatrial electromechanical delay, intra-atrial electromechanical delay, and P-wave dispersion. RESULTS: Maximum P-wave duration, P-wave dispersion, and interatrial electromechanical delay were significantly higher in patients with acute rheumatic fever compared with the control group (p < 0.001). However, there was no difference in terms of intra-atrial electromechanical delay (p > 0.05). For patients with acute rheumatic fever, a positive correlation was identified between the left atrium diameter and the P-wave dispersion and interatrial electromechanical delay (r = 0.524 and p < 0.001, and r = 0.351 and p = 0.014, respectively). Furthermore, an important correlation was also identified between the P-wave dispersion and the interatrial electromechanical delay (r = 0.494 and p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study shows the prolongation of P-wave dispersion and interatrial electromechanical delay in acute rheumatic fever. Left atrial enlargement can be one of the underlying reasons for the increase in P-wave dispersion and interatrial electromechanical delay.
