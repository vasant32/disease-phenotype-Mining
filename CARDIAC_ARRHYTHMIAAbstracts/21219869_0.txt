Extracellular acidosis occurs in the heart during myocardial ischemia and can lead to dangerous arrhythmias. Potassium channels encoded by hERG (human ether-à-go-go-related gene) mediate the cardiac rapid delayed rectifier K+ current (IKr), and impaired hERG function can exacerbate arrhythmia risk. Nearly all electrophysiological investigations of hERG have centred on the hERG1a isoform, although native IKr channels may be comprised of hERG1a and hERG1b, which has a unique shorter N-terminus. This study has characterised for the first time the effects of extracellular acidosis (an extracellular pH decrease from 7.4 to 6.3) on hERG channels incorporating the hERG1b isoform. Acidosis inhibited hERG1b current amplitude to a significantly greater extent than that of hERG1a, with intermediate effects on coexpressed hERG1a/1b. IhERG tail deactivation was accelerated by acidosis for both isoforms. hERG1a/1b activation was positively voltage-shifted by acidosis, and the fully-activated current-voltage relation was reduced in amplitude and right-shifted (by ∼10 mV). Peak IhERG1a/1b during both ventricular and atrial action potentials was both suppressed and positively voltage-shifted by acidosis. Differential expression of hERG isoforms may contribute to regional differences in IKr in the heart. Therefore inhibitory effects of acidosis on IKr could also differ regionally, depending on the relative expression levels of hERG1a and 1b, thereby increasing dispersion of repolarization and arrhythmia risk.
