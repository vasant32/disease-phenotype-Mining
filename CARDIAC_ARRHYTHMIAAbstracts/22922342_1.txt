 AIM: To investigate the anti-arrhythmic effects of sulfamide analogues of changrolin and to characterize the sulfate of compound 6f (sulcardine sulfate, Sul) as a novel anti-arrhythmic agent. METHODS: The anti-arrhythmic effects of compounds were studied against aconitine-induced arrhythmias in rats and ouabain-induced arrhythmias in guinea pigs. The effects of Sul on transmembrane action potentials were investigated in isolated rabbit sinoatrial nodes and guinea-pig papillary muscles using intracellular recording. With a whole-cell recording technique, the effects of Sul on sodium current, calcium current, and potassium currents were examined in isolated single guinea-pig ventricular myocytes. RESULTS: In aconitine-induced arrhythmias of rats, sulfamide analogues of changrolin (4, 5, and 6a-6p) exhibited various anti-arrhythmic activities. The sulfate of compound 6f (Sul) increased the amount of aconitine required to induce arrhythmias in each treated animal. The ED₅₀ value of Sul in rats was 196 mg/kg. In ouabain-induced arrhythmias of guinea pigs, 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg doses of Sul increased the dose of ouabain required to induce VP, VT, and VF in a dose-dependent manner. In papillary preparations, Sul produced a concentration-dependent decrease in APA and V(max), prolonged APD(90) and ERP, whereas RP was unaffected. In the spontaneously beating sinus nodes, Sul reduced APA and V(max) in a concentration-dependent manner. The whole-cell recording studies revealed that Sul produced a reversible reduction in I(Na) (IC₅₀=26.9 μmol/L) and I(Ca,L)(IC₅₀=69.2 μmol/L), whereas the inward rectifier (I(K1)) and the delayed rectifier potassium currents (I(K)) were unaffected. CONCLUSION: As a multi-ion channel blocker, Sul may have potent efficacy in anti-atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.
