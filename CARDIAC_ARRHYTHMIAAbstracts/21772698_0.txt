When inhalational induction is indicated, sevoflurane is the most popular choice in both children and adults. Higher inspired concentrations of sevoflurane can cause adverse cardiac arrhythmias that are seen to disappear once the agent is discontinued. We report the occurrence of isorhythmic atrioventricular dissociation and junctional rhythm with absent P waves during sevoflurane anaesthesia in an adult and a child, respectively.
