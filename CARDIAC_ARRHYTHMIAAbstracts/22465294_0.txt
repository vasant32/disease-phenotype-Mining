 BACKGROUND: Islets of myocytes within fibrofatty scars represent the substrate for reentrant ventricular arrhythmias in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Electroanatomic mapping can reliably identify such areas. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively test the association between late and fragmented electrograms within scar and arrhythmic events in patients with ARVC. METHODS: High-density right ventricle electroanatomic mapping was performed in 32 patients with ARVC without history of cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular arrhythmias. Standard definitions of electroanatomic scars and fragmented, isolated, and very late potentials were used. All patients received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for the primary prevention of sudden death. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 25 ± 7 months, 12 (38%) patients received appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shock for sustained ventricular arrhythmias. With the exception of a higher rate of previous syncope (P = .053), patients with arrhythmic events at follow-up did not differ from those who remained free from arrhythmic events in terms of other clinical variables, including cardiac magnetic resonance findings. Electroanatomic scars were present in all patients. The distribution and extent of electroanatomic scars were similar in the 2 groups (38 ± 25 cm(2) vs 33 ± 20 cm(2); P = .51). However, patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shock had a higher prevalence of fragmented electrograms (92% vs 20%; P <.001), of isolated late potentials (75% vs 20%; P = .004), and of very late potentials (67% vs 25%; P = .030). Fragmented electrograms were the only variable independently associated with arrhythmic events at follow-up (hazard ratio 21; P = .015). CONCLUSION: The presence of fragmented and delayed electrograms within the scar predicts arrhythmic events in ARVC.
