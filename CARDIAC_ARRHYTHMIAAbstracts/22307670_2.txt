Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) have been implicated in severe cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac deaths. However, the mechanism(s) for EAD genesis, especially regarding the relative contribution of Ca(2+) wave (CaW) vs. L-type Ca current (I(Ca,L)), still remains controversial. In the present study, we simultaneously recorded action potentials (APs) and intracellular Ca(2+) images in isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes and systematically compared the properties of EADs in the following two pharmacological models: 1) hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2); 200 Î¼M); and 2) isoproterenol (100 nM) and BayK 8644 (50 nM) (Iso + BayK). We assessed the rate dependency of EADs, the temporal relationship between EADs and corresponding CaWs, the distribution of EADs over voltage, and the effects of blockers of I(Ca,L), Na/Ca exchangers, and ryanodine receptors. The most convincing evidence came from the AP-clamp experiment, in which the cell membrane clamp was switched from current clamp to voltage clamp using a normal AP waveform without EAD; CaWs disappeared in the H(2)O(2) model, but persisted in the Iso + BayK model. We postulate that, although CaWs and reactivation of I(Ca,L) may act synergistically in either case, reactivation of I(Ca,L) plays a predominant role in EAD genesis under oxidative stress (H(2)O(2) model), while spontaneous CaWs are a predominant cause for EADs under Ca(2+) overload condition (Iso + BayK model).
