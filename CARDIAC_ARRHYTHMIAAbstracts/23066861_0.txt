 OBJECTIVE: The role of adipokines in the development of cardiac syndrome X (CSX) remains unknown. METHODS: Fifty-nine CSX subjects were retrospectively enrolled from our catheterization databank. Another 54 subjects with valvular heart disease or arrhythmia served as controls. Adipokines were measured by ELISA tests. RESULTS: The CSX had lower circulating adiponectin but higher leptin and higher leptin/adiponectin ratio (×1000) (3.78 ± 4.96 vs. 2.14 ± 5.67, p < 0.001) than those of the controls. In a multivariate analysis, a higher leptin/adiponectin ratio was a predictor of CSX, while insulin-resistance index was not. CONCLUSIONS: Adipokines may be implicated in the pathogenesis of CSX.
