Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common chronic arrhythmia and the most serious heart rhythm irregularity in individuals older than 70. It is usually not life threatening in and of itself, but it can lead to serious medical problems, including stroke, additional heart rhythm problems, and heart failure. Symptoms of AF vary considerably. Some patients are asymptomatic and have a self-limiting arrhythmia of short duration that converts to normal sinus without any intervention. Symptomatic patients may experience minor palpitations, severe palpitations, or even more vague symptoms such as lightheadedness, shortness of breath, or fatigue. More serious symptoms, such as syncope, new or worsening heart failure, or a cerebral vascular accident, may occur. The initial goals of treatment include controlling ventricular rate and addressing anticoagulation status. New guidelines help clinicians effectively manage anticoagulant therapy for older adults newly diagnosed with AF.
