 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the commonest rhythm abnormality and it increases with ageing. The main objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of AF in hospitalized old patients as well as its characteristics and related clinical and therapeutic factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective, multicenter, observational study in patients aged â‰¥ 70 years with AF, who had been hospitalized in Internal Medicine or Geriatrics wards. All variables studied were obtained from the patients' clinical records. RESULTS: Out of 3,319 evaluable patients, 922 had an AF, which represents a prevalence of 31.3% (CI 95%; 29.7-32.9). The mean age was 82 years (6.1; 69.9-101.8) and 57% were women. 88.7% of patients (818 p) had an AF before admission. AF was long-standing persistent or permanent in 728 cases (89.1%) and it was the first episode (paroxysmal or persistent) in 51 patients (6.2%). There was a clear etiology of AF in only 4.1% cases. Congestive heart failure was the commonest reason for hospitalization in our patients. Regarding the cardiovascular risk factors, 80.3% patients were hypertensive, 36.4% had dyslipemia, 38.2% had diabetes and 5% were active smokers. Associated diseases included renal insufficiency (38.1%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (38.2%); in addition, 188 patients (20.4%) had suffered from cerebrovascular accidents. Finally, 67.4% patients had received antiarrhythmic drugs for their FA. Although 86.1% had received thromboembolic prevention therapy, only 54.1% were under oral anticoagulation. Finally, 6.9% patients had antiarrhythmic drugs-related side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Over one third of hospitalized patients older than 70 years have AF, which is generally relapsing and permanent. Heart failure is the commonest reason for hospitalization in these patients and about 40% have an associated disease.
