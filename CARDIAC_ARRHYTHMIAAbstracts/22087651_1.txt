FK506 binding protein12.6 (FKBP12.6) binds to the Ca(2+) release channel ryanodine receptor (RyR2) in cardiomyocytes and stabilizes RyR2 to prevent premature sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release. Previously, two different mouse strains deficient in FKBP12.6 were reported to have different abnormal cardiac phenotypes. The first mutant strain displayed sex-dependent cardiac hypertrophy, while the second displayed exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death. In this study, we tested whether FKBP12.6-deficient mice that display hypertrophic hearts can develop exercise-induced cardiac sudden death and whether the hypertrophic heart is a direct consequence of abnormal calcium handling in mutant cardiomyocytes. Our data show that FKBP12.6-deficient mice with cardiac hypertrophy do not display exercise-induced arrhythmia and/or sudden cardiac death. To investigate the role of FKBP12.6 overexpression for cardiac function and cardiomyocyte calcium release, we generated a transgenic mouse line with cardiac specific overexpression of FKBP12.6 using α-myosin heavy chain (αMHC) promoter. MHC-FKBP12.6 mice displayed normal cardiac development and function. We demonstrated that MHC-FKBP12.6 mice are able to rescue abnormal cardiac hypertrophy and abnormal calcium release in FKBP12.6-deficient mice.
