The article discusses the data of a study aimed at the impact of the metabolic syndrome on arrhythmias in elderly women. Analysis of the data showed that supraventricular arrhythmias were detected in most part of elderly women, ventricular arrhythmias a few less. The share of prognostically unfavorable arrhythmias is small, but they develop linked to the metabolic changes, and dangerous ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation develop more often in patients with metabolic syndrome.
