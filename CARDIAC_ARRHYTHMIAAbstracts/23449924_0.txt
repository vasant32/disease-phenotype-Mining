AIMS: The aim of this study was to describe the early phase United Kingdom (UK) clinical experience with a novel entirely subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD).METHODS AND RESULTS: A questionnaire was sent to all UK hospitals implanting S-ICDs. Nineteen of 25 (76%) hospitals responded with the details of 111 implanted patients [median 5/hospital (range 1-18)]. Mean duration of follow-up was 12.7 ± 7.1 months. Median patient age was 33 years (range 10-87 years). Underlying pathology was primary electrical disease in 43%, congenital heart disease 12%, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 20%, ischaemic cardiomyopathy 14%, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy 5%, and other cardiomyopathies 7% patients. Nineteen (17%) patients required 20 re-operations, including permanent device explantation in 10 (9%). Twenty-four appropriate shocks were delivered in 13 (12%) patients, including 10 for ventricular fibrillation. One patient suffered arrhythmic death, but there were no failures to detect or terminate ventricular arrhythmias above the programmed detection rate. Fifty-one inappropriate shocks were delivered in 17 (15%) patients. Forty-one (80%) were for T-wave over-sensing and 1 (2%) for atrial flutter-wave over-sensing. The 11 patients who received inappropriate shocks due to T-wave over-sensing were significantly younger than patients who did not (24 ± 10 vs. 37 ± 19 years; P = 0.02).CONCLUSION: The S-ICD is an important innovation in ICD technology. However, these data indicate that adverse event rates are significant during early clinical adoption. Important lessons in patient selection, implant technique, and device programming can be learnt from this experience.
