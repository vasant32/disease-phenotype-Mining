Digitalis glycosides, a group of cardiotonic agents for heart failure, have been used for a long time, but may often trigger arrhythmias as a result of digitalis intoxication. It is of great significance in finding a method to reduce their toxicity and improve clinical curative effects simultaneously in the application of digitalis glycosides. It has been well documented that acupuncture has good therapeutic effects in improving cardiac function and inhibiting arrhythmia induced by myocardial ischemia. Acupuncture combined with chemotherapeutics can reduce the adverse effects of chemotherapeutics. Accordingly, acupuncture combined with digitalis is likely to reduce the side effects of digitalis by regulating intracellular Ca2+, improving the function of Ca(2+)-ATPase in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, increasing calcium sensitivity of cardiac troponin, etc. These considerations may provide a novel clue for treatment of heart failure by joint administration of acupuncture and drugs.
