Myocardial cells in pulmonary veins are thought to play a major role in the initiation and maintenance of atrial arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation. In experiments on rat pulmonary veins, antiarrhythmic drug niferidil (RG-2) produced increase of APD90% and functional refractory period and decrease of action potential amplitude and slope of APD restitution curve. Thus niferidil (RG-2) exerts stronger action on pulmonary veins than left atrium. This can take important part in Niferidil (RG-2) antiarrhythmic activity.
