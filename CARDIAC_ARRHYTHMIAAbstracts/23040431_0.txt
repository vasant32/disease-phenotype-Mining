 BACKGROUND: Genetic factors are believed to be important in early-onset lone atrial fibrillation (AF). The gene GJA5 encodes the gap-junction protein Cx40, which together with Cx43 is responsible for the electrical coupling of the atrial cardiomyocytes. The regulatory single nucleotide polymorphism rs10465885 in GJA5 was recently associated with early-onset lone AF (< 60 years) and was also found to be strongly associated with Cx40 messenger RNA levels. We hypothesized that this gene would have a strong effect in patients with a more selected phenotype, and that the findings regarding rs10465885 could be replicated in this group. METHODS: The coding region and flanking intron sequences of GJA5 were resequenced in 342 patients with onset of lone AF before the age of 50 (mean age at onset 34 Â± 9 years), and in 216 controls. The single nucleotide polymorphism rs10465885 was genotyped in 342 patients and 534 control subjects and odds ratios were calculated for different genetic models. RESULTS: Genotyping of rs10465885 showed that the patients with early-onset lone AF were more likely to carry the A allele compared with controls (odds ratio = 1.30; P = 0.011). When resequencing GJA5, we identified the mutation A96S, previously associated with lone AF, which was not present in our control subjects or in any publicly available database or the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Exome Variant Server (NHLBI EVS; 10,758 alleles). CONCLUSIONS: We show a highly significant association between the A allele of rs10465885 and onset of lone AF before age 50. This opposes a previous study, wherein the G allele was found to be associated with AF, and makes it impossible to exclude that the associations are coincidental.
