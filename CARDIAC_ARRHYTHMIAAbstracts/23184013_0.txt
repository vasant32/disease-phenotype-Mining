Isolated left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) is a morphological abnormality of excessive trabeculation of the LV, often complicated by ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmias and cardioembolism. Advances in cardiovascular imaging and widespread availability of imaging technology have led to an increase in the diagnosis of LVNC imposing a need for evidence-based imaging diagnostic criteria. Although recent studies have addressed the utility of newer diagnostic methodologies and the incidence of adverse events in this condition, the diagnosis and management remain controversial. In this review, we provide an overview of the current controversies in the clinical diagnosis of LVNC, and suggest a management approach.
