Insulin resistance, which characterizes type 2 diabetes, is associated with reduced translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane following insulin stimulation, and diabetic patients with insulin resistance show a higher incidence of ischaemia, arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. The aim of this study was to examine whether GLUT4 deficiency leads to more severe alterations in cardiac electrical activity during cardiac stress due to hypoxia. To fulfil this aim, we compared cardiac electrical activity from cardiac-selective GLUT4-ablated (G4H-/-) mouse hearts and corresponding control (CTL) littermates. A custom-made cylindrical 'cage' electrode array measured potentials (Ves) from the epicardium of isolated, perfused mouse hearts. The normalized average of the maximal downstroke of Ves (
