 OBJECTIVE: To determine the outcome of neonates with a suspected antenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease (CHD) who were delivered away from a paediatric cardiothoracic centre and were initially managed in a level 3 Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. METHODS: An 18-year ongoing study conducted in a single institution. RESULTS: Between 1992 and 2009, 143 fetuses with suspected CHD were identified, and 124 babies were delivered locally. 13 babies with a normal postnatal echocardiogram and six with isolated arrhythmias were excluded from the study. Structural CHD was confirmed in 105 infants; of these, 94 (90%) survived the neonatal period. Of the 11 neonatal deaths, only four of these infants underwent surgery; most had additional risk factors including: prematurity, very low birth weight, and genetic and other structural congenital anomalies. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that appropriately selected infants with antenatally diagnosed CHD can be safely delivered and initially managed in a non-cardiac centre during their neonatal period. Deliveries need to be carefully planned with close collaboration among neonatologists, obstetricians, paediatric cardiologists, mid-wives and parents.
