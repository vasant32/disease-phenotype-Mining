 UNLABELLED: â€‚ INTRODUCTION: Dronedarone is a multichannel blocker with similar electrophysiological properties to amiodarone. Dronedarone has not been studied in humans as an agent to suppress ventricular arrhythmias. METHODS: This case report describes the dramatic antiarrhythmic effects of dronedarone in a patient with nonischemic cardiomyopathy and recurrent ventricular tachycardia, which was resistant to multiple antiarrhythmic agents and endocardial catheter ablation. RESULTS: Dronedarone was effective in completely suppressing ventricular tachycardia. CONCLUSION: Further research is needed to establish a potential larger role for dronedarone in controlling ventricular arrhythmias in humans.
