Atrial fibrillation is the commonest arrhythmia worldwide and is a growing problem. AF is responsible for 25% of all strokes, and these patients suffer greater mortality and disability. Warfarin has traditionally been the only successful therapy for stroke prevention, but its limitations have resulted in underutilisation. Major progress has been made in AF research, leading to improved management strategies. Better risk stratification permits identification of truly low-risk patients who do not require anticoagulation and we are able to simplify ourevaluation of a patient's bleeding risk.The advent of novel anticoagulants means warfarin is no longer the only choice for stroke prophylaxis. These drugs circumvent many of warfarin's inconveniences, but onlylong-term study and use will conclusively demonstrate how they compare to warfarin. The landscape of stroke prevention in AF has changed with effective alternatives to warfarin available for the first time in 60 years-but each new option brings new considerations.
