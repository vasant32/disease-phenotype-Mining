A patient with cardiac sarcoidosis showed low R-wave amplitude in the entire right ventricle (RV). To troubleshoot this, a left ventricular (LV) lead was implanted in the coronary vein. The pace/sense terminal of the defibrillation lead was connected to LV:IS-1 of the defibrillator. Conversely, the LV lead was connected to RV:IS-1. Induced ventricular fibrillation was successfully terminated without any undersensing.
