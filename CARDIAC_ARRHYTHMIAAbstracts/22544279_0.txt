 BACKGROUND: Esophageal hematoma recently has been reported as a form of esophageal injury after atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation, attributed to the use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). We sought to determine the incidence, clinical features, and sequelae of this form of esophageal injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a prospective series of 1110 AF ablation procedures performed under general anesthesia (GA) over 9 years. TEE was inserted after induction of GA to exclude left atrial appendage thrombus, define cardiac function, and guide transseptal puncture. The procedural incidence of esophageal hematoma was 0.27% (3/1110 procedures, mortality 0%). Odonyphagia, regurgitation, and hoarseness were the predominant symptoms, with an onset within 12 hours. There was absence of fever and neurological symptoms. Chest computed tomography excluded atrio-esophageal fistula and was diagnostic of esophageal hematoma localized to either the upper esophagus or extending the length of the mid and lower esophagus; endoscopy confirmed the diagnosis. Management was conservative in all cases comprising of ceasing oral intake and anticoagulation. Long term sequelae included esophageal stricture formation requiring dilatation, persistent esophageal dysmotility (mid esophageal hematoma), and vocal cord paralysis, resulting in hoarse voice (upper esophageal hematoma). CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal hematoma is a rare but important differential diagnosis for esophageal injury after TEE-guided AF ablation under GA, and can result in significant patient morbidity. Key clinical features differentiate presentation of esophageal hematoma from that of an atrio-esophageal fistula.
