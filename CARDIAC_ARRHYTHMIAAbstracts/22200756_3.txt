Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heart muscle disease characterized by progressive heart failure, and is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity. Recently, cellular therapy for end-stage heart failure has been emerging. We herein report a 56-year-old male who received a transplant of autologous myoblast sheets manufactured in temperature-responsive culture dishes. His clinical condition improved markedly, leaving him without any arrhythmia and able to discontinue using a left ventricular assist system and avoid cardiac transplantation. These findings suggest that cellular therapy using myoblast sheets is a promising new strategy for treating patients with end-stage DCM. This method might be an effective alternative to heart transplantation in the near future.
