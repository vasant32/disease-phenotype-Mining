Neurohormones (NHs) in the cascade of the arginine vasopressin (AVP) system have drawn particular attention in the recent years. Copeptin, the C-terminal portion of provasopressin, is a novel NH of the AVP system, and is known to be co-released with AVP from hypothalamus (neurohypophysis). As a surrogate marker of the AVP system, copeptin has gradually replaced AVP in several clinical studies largely due to its structural and methodological advantages. Copeptin has been regarded as a marker of non-specific stress response, and has also been suggested to have clinical implications in a variety of non-cardiovascular (pneumonia, sepsis, etc.) and cardiovascular conditions (heart failure and acute coronary syndromes (ACSs, etc.)). However, current data on relation of copeptin with other cardiovascular conditions ( arrhythmias, etc.) are still insufficient. The present review primarily focuses on general features of copeptin, its general clinical implications, and specifically aims to cover its potential clinical value in a variety of cardiovascular conditions.
