 BACKGROUND: Improvement in outcome of infants born with congenital heart defects has been accompanied by an increasing frequency of late arrhythmias. Ablation is difficult because of multiple tachycardias in the presence of complex anatomy with limited accessibility. We report on remote-controlled ablation using magnetic navigation in conjunction with 3D image integration in patients with previous intra-atrial baffle procedures. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirteen patients (8 male; age, 30.5Â±8 years) with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) underwent catheter ablation. Group A had a medical history of a Mustard or Senning operation, whereas group B had undergone total cavopulmonary connection. A total of 26 tachycardias were treated in 17 procedures (median cycle length of 280 ms). Group A patients had more inducible SVTs than group B, and all index SVTs were located in the remainder of the morphological right atrium in all but 1 patient. Retrograde access through the aorta was performed and led to successful ablation, using magnetic navigation with a very low total radiation exposure (median of 3.8 minutes in group A versus 5.9 minutes in group B). Only 1 of 13 patients continued to have short-lasting SVTs despite 3 ablation procedures during a median follow-up time of >200 days. CONCLUSIONS: Remote-controlled catheter ablation by magnetic navigation in combination with accurate 3D image integration allowed safe and successful elimination of SVTs, using an exclusively retrograde approach, resulting in low radiation exposure for patients after intra-atrial baffle procedures (Mustard, Senning, or total cavopulmonary connection).
