A case of radiofrequency catheter ablation of atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentry tachycardia, in a patient with transposition of the great arteries after venous rerouting according to Mustard, is described. An electroanatomical map of the His and AV nodal region was created from inside the systemic venous atrium. Retrograde mapping of the pulmonary venous atrium was performed and the arterial catheter retracted to a position in close proximity to the venous catheter inside the intraatrial baffle. This position was chosen to deliver radiofrequency current.
