A 57-year-old man with prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction underwent catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) exhibiting a left bundle branch block QRS morphology. After failed left ventricular ablation, catheter ablation from the right ventricle (RV) eliminated the VT. An RV voltage map demonstrated an area of low voltage around the successful ablation site that likely allowed for a VT substrate.
