 AIMS: Cardiogoniometry (CGM) is a spatio-temporal five-lead resting electrocardiographic method utilizing automated analysis. The purpose of this study was to determine CGM's and electrocardiography (ECG)'s accuracy for detecting myocardial ischaemia and/or lesions in comparison with perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty (n= 40) patients with suspected or known stable coronary artery disease were examined by CGM and resting ECG directly prior to CMRI including adenosine stress perfusion (ASP) and LGE. The investigators visually reading the CMRI were blinded to the CGM and ECG results. Half of the patients (n= 20) had a normal CMRI while the other half presented with either abnormal ASP and/or detectable LGE. Cardiogoniometry yielded an accuracy of 83% (sensitivity 70%) and ECG of 63% (sensitivity 35%) compared with CMRI. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study CGM compares more favourably than ECG with the detection of ischaemia and/or structural myocardial lesions on CMRI.
