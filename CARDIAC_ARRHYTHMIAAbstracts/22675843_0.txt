 BACKGROUND: The QT interval reflects the total duration of ventricular myocardial repolarization. Disturbed QT--either prolonged or shortened--is associated with arrhythmia and is life-threatening. OBJECTIVES: To investigate an elderly population for disturbed QT interval. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study on residents of long-term care wards in a geriatric hospital. Excluded were those with pacemaker, atrial fibrillation or bundle branch block. The standard 12 lead and lead 2 electrocardiograms in the patients' files were used for the evaluation of QT interval. RESULTS: We screened the ECGs of 178 residents. QTc prolongation based on the mean 12 ECG leads was detected in 48 (28%), while 45 (25%) had prolonged QTc based on lead L2. Factors associated with QT prolongation were male gender, chronic renal failure and diabetes mellitus. Short QT was found in 7 residents (4%) and was not related to any parameter. CONCLUSIONS: About one-third of the elderly long-term care residents in our study had QT disturbances. Such a considerable number warrants close QT interval follow-up in predisposed patients.
