 AIMS: To improve knowledge of epidemiological data, management, and clinical outcome of acute heart failure (AHF) in a real-life setting in France. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted an observational survey constituting a single-day snapshot of all unplanned hospitalizations because of AHF in 170 hospitals throughout France (the OFICA survey). A total of 1658 patients (median age 79 years, 55% male) were included. Family doctors were the first medical contact in 43% of cases, and patients were admitted through emergency departments in 64% of cases. Clinical scenarios were mainly acutely decompensated HF (48%) and acute pulmonary oedema (38%) with similar clinical and biological characteristics as well as outcome. Characteristics were different and severity higher in both shock and right HF. Infection and arrhythmia were the most frequent precipitating factors (27% and 24% of cases); diabetes and chronic pulmonary disease were the most frequent co-morbidities (31% and 21%). Over 80% of patients underwent both natriuretic peptide testing and echocardiography. LVEF was preserved (>50%) in 36% of patients and associated with specific characteristics and lower severity. Median hospital stay was 13 days; in-hospital mortality was 8.2%, and independent predictors were age, blood pressure, and creatinine. Treatment at discharge in patients with reduced LVEF included ACE inhibitors/ARBs, beta-blockers, and aldosterone inhibitors in 78, 67, and 27% cases. Non-surgical devices were reported in <20% of potential candidates. CONCLUSION: This comprehensive survey analysing AHF in real life emphasizes the heterogeneous nature and overall high severity of AHF. It could be a useful tool to identify unsolved medical issues and improve outcome. Trial registration: NCT01080937.
