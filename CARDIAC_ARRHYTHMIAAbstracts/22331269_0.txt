Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is a common cyanotic congenital heart disease. The most important late complications observed after repair of TOF are atrio-ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. We present a rare case of fatal embolism and sudden cardiac death in a 36-year-old patient, 30 years after the operation for TOF.
