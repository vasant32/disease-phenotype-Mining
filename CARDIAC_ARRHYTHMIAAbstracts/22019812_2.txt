 BACKGROUND: Plakophilin2 (PKP2) is a desmosome-related protein with numerous armadillo repeats and has been linked to arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Fatal arrhythmias resulting in sudden death also occur in the absence of morphologic cardiac abnormalities at autopsy, and have been linked to ion channel mutations in a subset of cases, but so far not to PKP2. METHODS AND RESULTS: We sequenced all 14 exons of PKP2 in DNA extracted from postmortem heart tissues of 25 patients dying from ARVC and 25 from sudden unexpected death with negative autopsy (SUDNA). The primers were designed using the Primer Express 3.0 software. Direct sequencing for both sense and antisense strands was performed with a BigDye Terminator DNA sequencing kit on a 3130XL Genetic Analyzer. Mutation damage prediction was made using Mutation Taster, Polyphen and SIFT software. In 6 of the 25 ARVC samples, 6 PKP2 mutations were identified, 4 of which were likely significant, and 3 of which were novel (p.N641del, p.L64PfsX22, p.G269R). In 6 of the 25 cases of SUDNA samples, 6 PKP2 mutations were identified, 3 of which were likely significant, and 4 of which were not previously described (p.P665S, p.Y217TfsX45, p.E540, p.S615T). CONCLUSIONS: PKP2 mutations are not specific for ARVC and may result in SUDNA. The link between ARVC and desmosomal mutations may not be causal but related to an association between defective desmosomal proteins and arrhythmias.
