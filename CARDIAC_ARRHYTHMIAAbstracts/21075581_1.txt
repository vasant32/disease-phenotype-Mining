Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation is a rare entity seen in a very small subset of patients presenting to the emergency department. Management of ventricular arrhythmias in pregnant women is similar to that in nonpregnant women, but special consideration is given to avoid adverse fetal effects when selecting antiarrhythmic agents. Electrical defibrillation is the intervention of choice in both pregnant and nonpregnant patients with ventricular fibrillation of all etiologies. This was not associated with any significant adverse effects for mother or fetus. Although lidocaine and sotalol are Food and Drug Administration category B antiarrhythmics used in pregnancy, Food and Drug Administration category C antiarrhythmics such as Î²-blockers and category D drugs such as amiodarone can be used as pharmacologic adjuncts to facilitate termination of recurrent ventricular fibrillation where other agents have failed. Isoproterenol has been used to terminate recurrent ventricular fibrillation in patients with Brugada syndrome and torsades de pointes resistant to magnesium therapy. This case report describes a previously healthy 32-year-old pregnant woman with recurrent idiopathic ventricular fibrillation that failed to respond to standard therapy including electrical defibrillation, intravenous lidocaine, metoprolol, and amiodarone but eventually terminated with isoproterenol infusion.
