Objectives: There is increasing evidence linking inflammation and oxidative stress to atrial fibrillation (AF). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that C-reactive protein (CRP) and oxidative stress markers can predict the recurrence of persistent AF after successful pharmacological cardioversion. A possible relationship with AF occurrence was also investigated. Study design: Using a case-control study design, CRP, catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels of 42 patients (23 female, 19 male; mean age 58.4±13.6 years) with documented persistent AF episodes were compared with 21 controls (9 female; 12 male; mean age 58.1±6.9 years). Results: Overall AF patients were followed for 6 months, and 17 showed recurrence. Then, they were divided into two groups (recurrence and no recurrence) and compared with each other. CRP, SOD, and MDA levels were significantly higher in AF patients compared with controls. However, only CRP levels were significantly higher in patients with AF recurrence compared to those without recurrence. Conclusion: Increased markers of inflammation and oxidative stress are found in patients with persistent AF, suggesting that inflammation and oxidative stress may be associated with the presence of arrhythmia.
