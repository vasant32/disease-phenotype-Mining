AIMS: Ion channel remodeling and ventricular conduction system alterations play relevant roles in the generation of cardiac arrhythmias, but the interaction between ion channel remodeling and cardiac conduction system dysfunctions in an arrhythmogenic context remain unexplored.Methods and ResultsWe have used a transgenic mouse line previously characterized as an animal model of Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) to analyse ion channel remodeling and ventricular conduction system (VCS) configuration. RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry analysis showed early cardiac sodium channel upregulation at embryonic stages prior to the onset of Kv potassium channel remodeling, and cardiac hypertrophy at fetal stages. In line with these findings, patch-clamp assays demonstrated changes in sodium current density and a slowing of recovery from inactivation. Functional analysis by optical mapping revealed an immature ventricular activation pattern as well as an increase in the total left ventricle activation time in fetal transgenic hearts. Morphological analysis of LQTS transgenic mice in a Cx40(GFP/+) background demonstrated ventricular conduction system dysmorphogenesis during heart development. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate early sodium channel remodeling secondary to IKs blockage in a mouse model of LQTS leading to morphological and functional anomalies in the developing ventricular conduction system and cardiac hypertrophy. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying fetal and neonatal cardiac electrophysiological disorders, which might help understand how molecular, functional, and morphological alterations are linked to clinical pathologies such as cardiac congenital anomalies, arrhythmias and perinatal sudden death.
