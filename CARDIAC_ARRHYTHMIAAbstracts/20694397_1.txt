We report the association between heart disease associated with noncompaction of the left ventricular myocardium (NCLVM) and chronic Chagas' heart disease (CCHD) in a patient with heart failure, ischemic stroke and cardiac arrhythmia. Images typical of NCLVM and CCHD were documented by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI).
