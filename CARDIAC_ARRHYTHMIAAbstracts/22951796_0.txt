Features of dynamics of arterial hypertension and rhythm disorders within 3 years after the termination of alcohol intake were studied. The study included 260 patients with alcoholic dependence at the age from 22 to 74 years (mean age 46Â±6.6 years). The functional state of the cardiovascular system was evaluated. It has been shown that within 1 month after the termination of alcohol intake, 73.1% of patients develop arterial hypertension that needs treatment. Cardiac rhythm disorders were registered in 23.1% of cases. Antiarrhythmic drugs are recommended, in at least 83.1% cases, to patients having the combination of arterial hypertension and paroxismal ventricular rhythm disorders in the endpoint of the study. Efficacy of hypotensive and antiarrhytmic drugs is analyzed.
