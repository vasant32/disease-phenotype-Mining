 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of thoracolaparoscopic subtotal esophagectomy in the treatment of esophageal cancer. METHODS: Clinical data of 98 patients with esophageal cancer who underwent thoracolaparoscopic subtotal esophagectomy from March 2009 to October 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. One hundred and five patients were served as controls who underwent open three-field subtotal esophagectomy in the same period. RESULTS: There were significant differences between thoracolaparoscopic and open three-field subtotal esophagectomy in blood loss [(85.1±32.8) ml vs. (215.5±60.6) ml], length of stay [(12.7±3.5) d vs. (16.9±4.5) d]), pneumonia (4.1% vs. 12.4%, P<0.05), atelectasis (3.1% vs. 10.5%, P<0.05), pleural effusion (3.1% vs. 10.5%, P<0.05), acute respiratory distress (1.0% vs. 7.6%, P<0.05) and arrhythmia (4.1% vs. 12.4%, P<0.05). No significant differences were observed in the number of lymph node harvested, operative time, anastomotic leak, thoracic abscess, chyle chest, re-laparotomy, re-thoracotomy, vocal cord paralysis, renal failure, gastric emptying, and mortality(all P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Thoracolaparoscopic subtotal esophagectomy is technically feasible and safe and is associated with less blood loss, less cadiopulmonary complication, and shorter hospital stay.
