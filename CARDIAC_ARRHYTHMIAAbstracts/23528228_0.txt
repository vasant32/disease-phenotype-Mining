Based on a porcine model with surgically created myocardial infarction (MI) as a pre-clinical scheme, this study investigates the clinical translation of cell sheet fragments of autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for cellular cardiomyoplasty. MSC sheet fragments retaining endogenous extracellular matrices are fabricated using a thermo-responsive methylcellulose hydrogel system. Echocardiographic observations indicate that transplantation of MSC sheet fragments in infarcted hearts can markedly attenuate the adverse ventricular dilation and preserve the cardiac function post MI, which is in contrast to the controlled groups receiving saline or dissociated MSCs. Additionally, histological analyses suggest that administering MSC sheet fragments significantly prevents the scar expansion and left ventricle remodeling after MI. Immunohistochemistry results demonstrate that the engrafted MSCs can differentiate into endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, implying that angiogenesis and the subsequent regional perfusion improvement is a promising mechanism for ameliorating post-infarcted cardiac function. However, according to the data recorded by an implantable loop recorder, the transplanted MSCs may provoke arrhythmia. Nevertheless, the proposed approach may potentially lead to the eventual translation of MSC-based therapy into practical and effective clinical treatments.
