We present a case of 8 year-old boy with several episodes of ventricular fibrillation in the course of tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy and severe decompensated heart failure. The cardiomyopathy was caused by incessant long-RP tachycardia that was resistant to pharmacotherapy. Despite initial suspition that the arrhythmia was permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia (PJRT) electrophysiology study revealed atypical atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia. Due to clinical and electrocardiographical presentation mimicking PJRT such arrhythmia merits the name 'pseudo PJRT'.
