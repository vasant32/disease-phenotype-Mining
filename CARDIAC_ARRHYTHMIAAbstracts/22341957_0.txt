Cardiac rhythm changes are not uncommon in connection with seizures and should be considered and recognized given their potentially harmful consequences including Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). The most well known are ictal tachycardia and bradycardia. However, other potentially dangerous peri-ictal arrhythmias have been reported. Brief atrial fibrillation episodes, never longer than 2 min, have rarely been described in connection with seizures. We report the case of a patient who presented with two generalized tonic-clonic seizures associated with prolonged atrial fibrillation. Extensive non-invasive cardiac investigations failed to disclose cardiac abnormalities, and after proper antiepileptic drug treatment the patient had neither further seizures nor cardiac events in an 18-month follow-up. Our case, to our knowledge, is the first report of prolonged (more than 1 h) peri-ictal atrial fibrillation.
