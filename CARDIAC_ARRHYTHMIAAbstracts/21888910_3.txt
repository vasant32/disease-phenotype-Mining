To explore whether CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation events mediate reperfusion arrhythmias, Langendorff perfused hearts were submitted to global ischemia/reperfusion. Epicardial monophasic or transmembrane action potentials and contractility were recorded. In rat hearts, reperfusion significantly increased the number of premature beats (PBs) relative to pre-ischemic values. This arrhythmic pattern was associated with a significant increase in CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of Ser2814 on Ca(2+)-release channels (RyR2) and Thr17 on phospholamban (PLN) at the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). These phenomena could be prevented by the CaMKII-inhibitor KN-93. In transgenic mice with targeted inhibition of CaMKII at the SR membranes (SR-AIP), PBs were significantly decreased from 31±6 to 5±1 beats/3min with a virtually complete disappearance of early-afterdepolarizations (EADs). In mice with genetic mutation of the CaMKII phosphorylation site on RyR2 (RyR2-S2814A), PBs decreased by 51.0±14.7%. In contrast, the number of PBs upon reperfusion did not change in transgenic mice with ablation of both PLN phosphorylation sites (PLN-DM). The experiments in SR-AIP mice, in which the CaMKII inhibitor peptide is anchored in the SR membrane but also inhibits CaMKII regulation of L-type Ca(2+) channels, indicated a critical role of CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of SR proteins and/or L-type Ca(2+) channels in reperfusion arrhythmias. The experiments in RyR2-S2814A further indicate that up to 60% of PBs related to CaMKII are dependent on the phosphorylation of RyR2-Ser2814 site and could be ascribed to delayed-afterdepolarizations (DADs). Moreover, phosphorylation of PLN-Thr17 and L-type Ca(2+) channels might contribute to reperfusion-induced PBs, by increasing SR Ca(2+) content and Ca(2+) influx.
