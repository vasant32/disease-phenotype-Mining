The first synthesis of m-hydroxymexiletine (MHM) has been accomplished. MHM displayed hNav1.5 sodium channel blocking activity, and tests indicate it to be âˆ¼2-fold more potent than the parent mexiletine and to have more favorable toxicological properties than mexiletine. Thus, MHM and possible related prodrugs might be studied as agents for the treatment of arrhythmias, neuropathic pain, and myotonias in substitution of mexiletine (metabolite switch), which has turned out to be tainted with common toxicity.
