 BACKGROUND AND AIM: The purpose of this study was to determine the role of dominant frequency (DF) and organised index (OI) in outcomes of pulmonary vein (PV) isolation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS: OI and DF of electrograms in coronary vein (CS) during AF were obtained by frequency spectra analysis in 60 patients with paroxysmal AF who underwent PV isolation. Based on the results of 12 months follow up, 14 patients with recurrent AF were included in group 1 and 46 patients with sinus rhythm were included in group 2. RESULTS: In group 1, no spectral component was reduced by PV isolation. Spectral components were reduced by PV isolation in 23 patients in group 2. The changes of DF after PV isolation was significantly different between groups 1 and 2 (1.2 ± 1.2 vs. 2.4 ± 1.3, p = 0.01); the increment of OI after PV isolation in group 1 was significantly lower than in group 2 (9 ± 13% vs. 22 ± 17%, p = 0.02. CONCLUSIONS: A decrease in DF and an increase in OI after PV isolation may suggest a better clinical outcome.
