We report a 46-year-old man who presented with hypothyroidism. An electrocardiogram obtained at the time of the first examination revealed Brugada electrocardiographic (Brugada-ECG) waveforms in leads V1 to V3. The patient and his family had no history of arrhythmia and syncopal attack. The Brugada-ECG waveforms disappeared with the normalization of thyroid function. The case suggested that hypothyroidism could lead to secondary Brugada-ECG waveforms because of its effect on myocardial ion channels.
