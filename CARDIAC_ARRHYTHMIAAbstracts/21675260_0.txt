The article is devoted to a rare congenital heart disease--corrected transposition of the major vessels. A hemodynamic scheme of the disease, its probable prognosis, possible development of arrhythmia, impairment of conduction and cardiac failure are described. A case is reported of myocardial infarction of anatomically right arterial ventricle in a middle-aged patient with isolated corrected transposition of the major vessels to illustrate a possible variant of the disease course.
