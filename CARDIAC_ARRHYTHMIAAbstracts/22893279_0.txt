 BACKGROUND: Supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVT, VT) are major concerns after repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). This study evaluated the impact of comprehensive treatment, including hemodynamic interventions such as surgery, catheter-based intervention and pacemaker implantation (PMI), on tachyarrhythmia in repaired TOF patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Of 66 repaired TOF patients with tachyarrhythmia (age at onset, 23Â±11 years), 29 patients had sustained SVT, 21 had sustained or non-sustained VT, and 16 had both (SVT+VT). Successful treatment with catheter-directed ablation and/or anti-arrhythmic drugs (AADs) alone was achieved in 31 (69%) and partially achieved in 6 (13%) of 45 patients. Surgery, catheter-based intervention, and/or PMI were performed in 21 (32%) of 66 patients and resulted in complete control of the arrhythmia in 8 (38%) and partial control in 7 (33%) of these 21 patients, 20 (95%) of whom were receiving AADs. Patients with successfully controlled tachyarrhythmia in response to catheter ablation and/or AADs without hemodynamic intervention had a significantly higher probability of absence of sinus node dysfunction (odds ratio [OR], 23.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-845.2; P=0.02) and lone intra-atrial reentrant tachycardia (OR, 12.4; 95% CI: 1.3-278.7; P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Hemodynamic interventions resulted in an improvement in outcomes in repaired TOF patients with tachyarrhythmia. To effectively manage intractable tachyarrhythmia with hemodynamic abnormalities, it is essential to understand hemodynamics and consider hemodynamic intervention.
