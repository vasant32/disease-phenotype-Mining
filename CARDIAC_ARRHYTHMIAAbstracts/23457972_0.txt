The authors discuss feasibility to extract additional information about electrical activity of the heart from the ECG magnitude and phase spectrum. Fifty digitized ECG fragments from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and PhysioBank ECG repository data were analyzed. It was shown that ECG phase harmonics contains valuable information about the ECG signal that can be used eventually for the development of advanced ECG analysis tools.
