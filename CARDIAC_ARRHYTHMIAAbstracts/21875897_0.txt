 BACKGROUND: Although the difference in the modulation of estradiol and dihydrotesterone on ventricular repolarization has been intensively studied, little information is available concerning the role of the different ovarian hormones in the modulation of repolarization in the female. METHODS: The chronic modulation of female hormones, estradiol, and progesterone, on cardiac repolarization and the susceptibility to d,l-sotalol, a class III antiarrhythmic agent, were studied in female rabbits by ovariectomy and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) through recording and analyzing of electrocardiograms. RESULTS: The corrected QT interval (QTc) measured 2 weeks after ovariectomy was not significantly different from that in the time-matched control rabbits. After 2 weeks of HRT, the QTc in the ovariectomized rabbits treated with estradiol alone (group E) was not significantly different from that in the control (group C); whereas in the ovariectomized rabbits treated with estradiol plus progesterone (group E + P), it was significantly shorter than those in groups E (P < .05) and C (P < .01), respectively. The corrected Tpeak-end interval (Tpec), an indicator of global dispersion of ventricular repolarization, was also significantly reduced in group E + P compared with that of group C (P < .01). In group E, d,l-sotalol-induced prolongation of QTc and the rate and the severity of arrhythmias were significantly higher, while the dose of sotalol to initiate arrhythmias was significantly lower than those in groups C or E + P, respectively (P < .05 or P < .01). CONCLUSION: Estradiol potentiates QTc prolonging effects of d,l-sotalol and increases the susceptibility to d,l-sotalol-induced arrhythmias without significantly altering QTc itself, whereas progesterone may accelerate the process of repolarization and protect the females from drug-induced arrhythmias, thus counteracting the effect of estradiol.
