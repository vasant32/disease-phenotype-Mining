Obese subjects show several electrocardiographic alterations, including prolonged QT interval, a marker for fatal cardiac arrhythmias. Prolonged QT interval has recently been linked to low testosterone levels, a frequent occurrence in male obese patients but no study has yet assessed whether hypoandrogenism contributes to QT interval prolongation in this population. Aim of this study was to evaluate whether prolonged QT interval is linked to hypogonadism in male obese subjects. QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) was measured from standard electrocardiogram recordings in 136 obese men (BMI 30 >kg/m(2), range 30.1-75.4 kg/m(2)). Obese men were classified as eugonadal or hypogonadal according to serum total testosterone levels (i.e., greater or less than 9.9 nmol/l). Our study showed that QTc measurements corrected by either Bazett (419 ± 3.2 vs. 408 ± 3.4 ms, P < 0.05), Fridericia (406.3 ± 3.39 vs. 396.4 ± 3.03 ms, P < 0.05) or Hodges (407.0 ± 3.12 vs. 397.3 ± 2.84 ms, P < 0.05) were longer in hypogonadal compared with eugonadal obese men; further, prolonged QTc interval (i.e., >440 ms) was more frequent among hypogonadal compared with eugonadal obese men (23% vs. 10%, P < 0.05). The degree of weight excess, diabetes, sleep apnoea and potassium levels were not associated with prolonged QTc. In conclusion, obese hypogonadal men show a greater prevalence of prolonged QT interval compared with their eugonadal counterparts. It appears therefore that low levels of testosterone in obese men may contribute to the arrhythmogenic profile of these patients, a heretofore unknown link which warrants further clinical attention.
