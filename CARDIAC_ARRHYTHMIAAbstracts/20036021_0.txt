Neurological disorders including chronic demyelinating syndromes (CDSs) have been known to elicit propensity to cardiac arrhythmias possibly due to autonomic imbalance, myocardial myocytolysis and some psychological conditions (major depression etc.) associated with these syndromes. CDSs are generally characterized by variable degrees of inflammatory response that may corrrelate with clinical disease activity (relapse, progression etc.). In the clinical setting, enhanced inflammatory response as measured with increased levels of inflammatory markers may predispose to cardiac arrhythmias via direct or indirect mechanisms. Therefore, substantial levels of inflammatory markers including pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with CDSs may serve as potential contributors to arrhythmogenesis indicating the possible link between disease activity and arrhythmia risk in patients with CDSs.
