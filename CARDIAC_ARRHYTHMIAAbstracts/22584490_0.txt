 BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in children is an increasingly common practice. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, in our institution, the results of RFA in children younger than 15 years. METHODS: A total of 125 children submitted to RFA between May 1991 and May 2010 were analyzed. RESULTS: Sixty-seven (53.6%) children were males, aged between 44 days and 15 years (mean 8.6 ± 3.3 years) with median weight of 31 kg. Heart disease was present in 21 (16.8%) patients. The RFA of accessory pathways (AP) was the most common procedure (62 children - 49.6%). The RFA of nodal reentrant tachycardia (NRT) was the second most common arrhythmia in 27 (21.6%), followed by atrial tachycardia (AT) in 16 (12.8%) and ventricular tachycardias (VT) in 8 (6.4%) children. The success criteria were achieved in 86.9%, 96.1%, 80% and 62.5% of patients undergoing RFA of AP, NRT, AT and VT, respectively. Transient AVB occurred during RFA in 4 (3.2%) and LBBB in 7 (5.6%) children. Twenty-five children underwent a new RFA due to initial failure or recurrence. During the mean follow up of 5.5 ± 3.4 years, 107 (88.4%) remained without recurrence. There was no statistical difference regarding the results and the age at which the patient underwent the procedure. No child had persistent AVB or required a permanent pacemaker. CONCLUSION: Catheter ablation is a safe and effective alternative therapy in children with recurrent tachycardias refractory to medical treatment.
