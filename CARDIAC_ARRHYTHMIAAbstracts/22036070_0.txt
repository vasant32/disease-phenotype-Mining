 BACKGROUND: Segmental arterial mediolysis, an uncommon arterial disorder most often occurring in the splanchnic muscular arteries of the abdomen, is a cause of catastrophic hemorrhages. Its histology and initial clinical presentations suggested that it represented a localized norepinephrine-induced vasospastic response to perturbations in vascular tone and blood volume distribution caused by coexisting vasoconstrictor conditions. However, later presentations were at odds with some aspects of this hypothesis. METHODS: Nine greyhound dogs were administered a single dose of ractopamine. Two dogs developing persistent conduction abnormalities with biochemical evidence of heart injury were euthanized and necropsied--one 4 days and the other 17 days after dosage This report is based on findings and comparisons of the canine abdominal and coronary arteries to segmental arterial mediolysis. RESULTS: Lesions having features of early-injurious-stage segmental arterial mediolysis were identified in the canine arteries 4 days postractopamine, and arteries examined after 17 days showed alterations typically occurring in reparative-stage segmental arterial mediolysis. It is suspected that ractopamine, a Beta-2 adrenergic agonist, created segmental arterial mediolysis by neuromodulating the peripheral sympathetic nervous system to release norepinephrine from varicosities of efferent nerves serving splanchnic arteries that stimulate alpha-1 receptors to induce injury at the adventitial medial junction and medial muscle apoptosis. CONCLUSION: This finding and other cited examples suggest that segmental arterial mediolysis may be a disorder principally caused by iatrogenic or accidental exposure to alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonists or Beta-2 agonists able to release norepinephrine from the peripheral nervous system.
