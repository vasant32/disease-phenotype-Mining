Uncommonly, a patient with a NeuroStimulator Device (NSD) for a neurologic indication requires a cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) for a cardiac indication. Typically in those with a unilateral pectoral NSD, the contralateral pectoral space is used for CIED implantation; however, in very rare occasions the patient has bilateral pectoral NSDs which makes subsequent implantation of a CIED challenging both because of placement and device interaction. Herein, we introduce the case of a 68-year-old gentleman with bilateral pectoral deep brain stimulators for Parkinsonism who received cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D) for advanced heart failure. The CRT-D generator was implanted in the abdomen and the CRT-D leads were placed through a minimally invasive epicardial approach. Both devices were tested without any evidence of device interaction.
