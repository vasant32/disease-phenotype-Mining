Commotio cordis is a rare type of blunt cardiac injury in which low impact chest trauma causes sudden cardiac arrest, usually occurs from being struck by a projectile during sports. The most common arrhythmia during commotio cordis is ventricular fibrillation, although complete heart block and an idioventricular rhythm have also been reported. We describe a case of a young patient who presented with a persistent third-degree atrioventricular block and a left bundle branch block, following blunt chest trauma, as a result of blow by soccer ball and subsequently needed a permanent pacemaker.
