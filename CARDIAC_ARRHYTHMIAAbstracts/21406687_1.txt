 BACKGROUND: Cardiac conduction disease is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by defects in electrical impulse generation and conduction and is associated with sudden cardiac death. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied a 4-generation family with autosomal dominant progressive cardiac conduction disease, including atrioventricular conduction block and sinus bradycardia, atrial arrhythmias, and sudden death. Genome-wide linkage analysis mapped the disease locus to chromosome 1p22-q21. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis of the LMNA gene, which encodes the nuclear-envelope protein lamin A/C, revealed a novel gene rearrangement involving a 24-bp inversion flanked by a 3.8-kb deletion upstream and a 7.8-kb deletion downstream. The presence of short inverted sequence homologies at the breakpoint junctions suggested a mutational event involving serial replication slippage in trans during DNA replication. CONCLUSIONS: We identified for the first time a complex LMNA gene rearrangement involving a double deletion in a 4-generation Dutch family with progressive conduction system disease. Our findings underscore the fact that if conventional polymerase chain reaction-based direct sequencing approaches for LMNA analysis are negative in suggestive pedigrees, mutation detection techniques capable of detecting gross genomic lesions involving deletions and insertions should be considered.
