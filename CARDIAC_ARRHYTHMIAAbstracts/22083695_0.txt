A 57-year-old man who had been receiving chemotherapy for multiple myeloma complained of chest pain and was diagnosed with coronary artery disease. Coronary artery bypass grafting without cardiopulmonary bypass was performed smoothly, and extubation was done in the operating room. The next evening, cluster of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation triggered by ventricular premature contractions occurred and required multiple electrical defibrillations. Despite intravenous administration of lidocaine, amiodarone, magnesium, and Î²-blocker, the storm sustained and was suppressed only by temporary ventricular overdrive pacing. He was discharged on foot.
