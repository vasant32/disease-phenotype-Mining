The aim of the work was to estimate dispersion of QT interval during Holler monitoring in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and arterial hypertension (AH). The study involved 28 patients with COPD (including 17 with COPD + AH), 31 patients with bronchial asthma (BA) (including16 with BA + AH), and 17 practically healthy subjects. It was shown that a combination of COPD and AH is associated with high-grade ventricular arrhythmia (by Lown-Wolf classification). Dispersion of QT interval indicates that the risk of life-threatening arrhythmia in patients with COPD and AH is unrelated to ventricular extrasystole and ventricular myocardium mass. Patients with BA and AH exhibited electrical instability regardless of myocardial mass only in the presence of ventricular arrhythmia. In the patients with BA and AH the QTcd interval increased in the second half of day, in COPD patients from morning till evening, and in patients with COPD + AH during 24 hours.
