 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical and angiographic outcomes using a 1.20 mm diameter angioplasty catheter as part of a predilation strategy for coronary lesion treatment. BACKGROUND: Development of an angioplasty catheter with low crossing profile and small balloon diameter represents an opportunity to facilitate percutaneous revascularization of complex coronary disease. METHODS: Clinical and angiographic outcomes were evaluated following a predilation treatment strategy using a low profile, 1.20 mm angioplasty catheter. The primary end-point of procedural success was defined as successful device delivery, performance and lesion treatment without occurrence of perforation, flow-limiting dissection, reduction in baseline TIMI grade, or clinically significant arrhythmias, and with final achievement of TIMI 3 flow. In-hospital major adverse events were also determined. RESULTS: Among 71 patients (83 lesions), angiographic characteristics included: de novo lesion, 75.9%; saphenous vein graft 9.6%; lesion length (mean ± standard deviation), 12.27 ± 5.96 mm; reference vessel diameter, 2.61 ± 0.57 mm; lesion classification B2/C, 59.0%; baseline TIMI 0/1 flow, 4.8%. Procedural success was achieved for 98.5% (66/67) of patients. Catheter delivery to the target lesion was achieved in all patients, and the rate of device success with luminal improvement after predilation was 96.2% (75/78). No acute procedural complications were observed, and in-hospital target lesion failure occurred in 6 patients (8.5%) related to peri-procedural non-Q wave myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS: Coronary lesion predilation with a low profile, 1.20 mm angioplasty catheter is associated with favorable procedural safety and efficacy and may represent an effective treatment for complex coronary anatomy.
