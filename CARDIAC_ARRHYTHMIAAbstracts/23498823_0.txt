In this report, we present a heart transplant recipient who developed cross-reactive paternal and donor-specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II antibodies during pregnancy, leading to accelerated cardiac allograft vasculopathy and severe allograft dysfunction 17 years after transplantation. This resulted in acute heart failure and ventricular arrhythmias requiring repeat heart transplantation.
