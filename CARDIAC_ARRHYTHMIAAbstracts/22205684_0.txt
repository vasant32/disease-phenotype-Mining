 BACKGROUND: An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is the therapy of choice for primary prevention in patients with ischemia who are at risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD). One third of patients with significant coronary disease have chronic total coronary occlusion (CTO), which is associated with long-term mortality in patients with previous myocardial infarction. However, the impact of CTO on the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias and long-term mortality in ICD recipients remains unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: All consecutive patients with coronary artery disease receiving ICD therapy for the prevention of SCD were included in the study. Among other characteristics, the existence of CTO was assessed. During follow-up, the occurrence of appropriate device delivery because of ventricular arrhythmias as well as mortality were noted. A total of 162 patients (mean age, 62Â±9 years; 93% men) with an ICD were included and followed for a median of 26 months (interquartile range, 12-42). At least 1 CTO was present in 71 (44%) patients. Appropriate device therapy was detected in 18% of the patients during the follow-up. The presence of CTO was associated with higher ventricular arrhythmia and mortality rates (log-rank test, <0.01). Multivariable analysis revealed that CTO was independently associated with appropriate ICD intervention (hazard ratio, 3.5; P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ischemic heart disease receiving ICDs for primary prevention of SCD, CTO is an independent predictor for the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias and has an adverse impact on long-term mortality.
