BACKGROUND: Electroanatomic mapping (EAM) systems are an important tool to identify cardiac chamber voltage and assess channels of slow conduction. OBJECTIVE: To assess the correlation between EAM voltage maps obtained during macro-reentrant tachycardia compared to sinus rhythm (SR) with a contact mapping system. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated patients with atrial flutter (AFL) referred for radiofrequency ablation with electroanatomic voltage maps obtained during AFL and SR. The atrium was divided into predetermined segments. Overall atrial and segmental peak-to-peak bipolar voltages in AFL and SR were assessed. To directly compare a region within the same patient, tissue voltage differences during AFL and SR was assessed based on mean voltage difference. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (87% male) had available voltage maps. Eighty-one percent had typical cavo-tricuspid isthmus-dependent right AFL. A mean of 441.7±153.9 vs 398.1±125.4 total points (p=0.22) were sampled during AFL and SR; with a mean of 99.5±58.9 vs. 91.2±60.4 points (p=0.45) sampled per region. Overall RA mean voltage was significantly higher during AFL than SR, (0.554±0.092 mV vs 0.473±0.079 mV, p=<0.001), with the lateral wall (0.707±0.120 mV vs. 0.573±0.097 mV, p=0.0004) and the CTI (0.559±0.100 mV vs. 0.356±0.066 mV, p<0.0001) also showing higher mean voltage during AFL. When compared within an individual patient, nineteen percent (14/75) of patient regions had a >0.5 mV mean voltage difference and 40% (30/75) had a >0.25 mV mean voltage difference. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that voltage maps performed during macro-reentrant atrial arrhythmias often vary significantly from maps obtained during SR.
