Recent studies have suggested an association between increased athletic activity and atrial arrhythmias; however, the mechanism remains unclear. Presented herein is a 71-year-old man with atrial flutter with 1:1 atrioventricular (AV) conduction triggered by high-intensity exercise as well as administration of isoproterenol, suggesting that arrhythmia is autonomically mediated.
