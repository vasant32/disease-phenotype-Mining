 BACKGROUND: The role of cryoballoon pulmonary vein isolation for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) is unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a 61-year-old man with persistent AF and severe mitral valve regurgitation, surgical cryoballoon pulmonary vein isolation was performed during open-heart surgery, without complication. CONCLUSION: Surgical cryoballoon ablation is feasible and can effectively isolate PV.
