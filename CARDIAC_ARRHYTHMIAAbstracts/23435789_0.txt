This report aims to provide a general description of the cardiovascular effects of dexmedetomidine, emphasizing its effects on conduction, and to give an evidence-based review of the literature regarding the use of dexmedetomidine to treat and prevent tachyarrhythmias in infants and children. A computerized bibliographic search of the literature on the use of dexmedetomidine to treat and prevent arrhythmias in infants and children was conducted. The cardiovascular effects of dexmedetomidine have been well studied in animal and adult human models. Growing experience, mostly in the pediatric population, has demonstrated the potential therapeutic applications of dexmedetomidine in the acute treatment of arrhythmias. Additionally, its use during cardiac surgery has been associated with a decreased incidence of postoperative ventricular and supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Although dexmedetomidine is not currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the pediatric population, findings have shown it to be effective in various clinical scenarios for sedation. In addition, recent studies show that dexmedetomidine may have promising properties for the acute treatment and prevention of tachyarrhythmias.
