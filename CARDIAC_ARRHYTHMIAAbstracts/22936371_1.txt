There have been major advances in recent years in the clinical setting of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, including new diagnostic criteria, a changing spectrum of the disease with even left dominant forms, the role of cardiac magnetic resonance and electroanatomic mapping, the expanding use of genetic screening and the existence of overlapping phenotypes. Moreover, early diagnosis at pre-participation screening with sports disqualification and risk stratification for the indication of ICD have been shown to be life-saving. In addition to traditional therapies targeting arrhythmias and congestive heart failure, an effective treatment of the disease could be based on the discovery of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathobiology of the disease in order to block the onset and progression of cell death.
