Sudden cardiac death (SCD) can be the first clinical manifestation of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. Catheter ablation of accessory pathways is now a safe and effective procedure, and is widely recommended in patients with WPW syndrome. However, management of the asymptomatic WPW patient remains controversial. Recent studies have readdressed the issue of risk stratification and prophylactic catheter ablation. We describe a case of malignant arrhythmia and aborted SCD as first presentation of WPW syndrome in a previously asymptomatic 17-year-old patient.
