Clinical manifestations of occupational respiratory diseases and functional cardiorespiratory state in workers were studied in thorough examination of 329 workers including main occupations of refractory metals alloys production, who are exposed to polymetallic highly dispersed aerosols in concentrations exceeding the MACs. The data obtained prove changes in intracardial hemodynamics, lower myocardial contractility and lung hypertension even at early stages of the process, progressing in the advanced disease and in post-contact period. Heart remodelling underlies frequent cardiac arrhythmias in occupational respiratory diseases. With that, intensity of the changes reliably increases with higher degree of bronchial obstruction in the patients and could serve as a marker of respiratory failure severity.
