Cardiac complications of chest trauma range from arrhythmias and valvular avulsions to myocardial contusion, rupture, and--rarely--myocardial infarction. Herein, we described a 44-year-old male patient who presented to the hospital after receiving a blow from a fist directly to the chest and fingertip amputation during a fight; anterior myocardial infarction without any chest pain was coincidentally detected. Our case illustrates the importance of electrocardiography in the initial evaluation of patients with chest trauma and suspected injury to the coronary arteries.
