This article is dedicated to the senior author Dr. Henry K. Kawamoto, Jr, who pioneered the use of orthognathic surgery to treat severe obstructive sleep apnea in 1981. Since that time, his techniques for maxillomandibular advancement have been revised and expanded for improved surgical success. Obstructive sleep apnea is a growing public health concern because it can cause hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, heart attack, stroke, and, in rare circumstances, sudden death if untreated. When less invasive options fail such as weight loss or dental devices for mandibular repositioning, maxillomandibular advancement is a valuable treatment option for severe obstructive sleep apnea.
