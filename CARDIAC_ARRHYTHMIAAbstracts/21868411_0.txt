 AIMS: The deleterious effects of apical right ventricular pacing has fostered the utilization of alternative pacing sites. Although right ventricular septal (RVS) sites are commonly used, the results have been controversial because of poor standardization of lead position by fluoroscopy. This study investigated the utility of a new RVS pacing technique based on the combination of fluoroscopy (F), and electrophysiological mapping (F + EP). Left ventricular (LV) electromechanical activation was determined in patients undergoing RVS pacing and the results of the F + EP approach were compared with those derived from standard F alone. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between December 2008 and November 2010 we enrolled 156 consecutive patients undergoing permanent RVS pacing. The standard F approach was used in 93 patients and the F + EP technique was applied to 63 patients. Electromechanical activation was assessed by: (i) electromechanical latency (EML) interval measured from the QRS onset to the mechanical activation of the basal LV and (ii) intra-LV dyssynchrony measured as the interval from the earliest to the latest LV basal motion. Intra-LV dyssynchrony was found in 46.2% patients in the F group compared with 15.9% in the group F + EP (P < 0.001). The F group demonstrated a significantly higher degree of intra-LV dyssynchrony than F + EP group (43.9 ± 24.3 vs. 26.5 ± 15.4 ms; P < 0.001). The F group exhibited a significantly higher EML duration compared with the F + EP group (215.8 ± 25.3 vs. 195.1 ± 17.4 ms; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: During RVS pacing, the F + EP approach provides a more physiological LV activation than the standard F technique. The prognostic significance of these short-term findings needs to be correlated with long-term data.
