The 'Lambeth Conventions' is a guidance document, written in 1987 (Walker et al., 1988), intended to be of practical value in the investigation of experimental arrhythmias induced by ischaemia, infarction, and reperfusion. This is an update, expanded to include guidance on the study of supraventricular arrhythmias, drug-induced arrhythmias, heritable arrhythmias, and advances in our knowledge in core areas since 1987. We have updated the guidance on the design and execution of experiments and the definition, classification, quantification, and analysis of all types of arrhythmias. Investigators are encouraged to adopt the conventions and test their validity in the hope that this will improve uniformity and interlaboratory comparisons, aid clinical research, facilitate antiarrhythmic drug discovery and safety assessment, and improve antiarrhythmic drug deployment for different cardiac conditions. We note that there is a gap between some definitions proposed here and their conventional clinical counterparts, and encourage the research necessary to bridge that translational gap.
