 AIM: The objective is to assess electrocardiographic characteristics predicting the precise location of ventricular arrhythmia (VA) origin within the right ventricle (RV) close to the His bundle (HB) region. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (14 men, age 65 ± 14 years) underwent successful catheter ablation of para-Hisian VA. Ventricular arrhythmias were considered to arise in the vicinity of the HB region based on the criteria that mapping exhibited the earliest RV activation before QRS onset in the HB region. Surface 12-lead electrocardiogram during the para-Hisian VAs was analysed. Of the 25 patients, 8 originated from the RV antero-septum just above the HB region, and 17 arose from the RV mid-septum just below the HB region. There was no significant difference in precedence of the local ventricular electrogram of the HB region from the onset of surface QRS during VAs. Surface electrocardiographic findings were characterized according to R-wave amplitude in lead I (0.43 ± 0.18 vs. 0.67 ± 0.19 mV, P = 0.005), mean R-wave amplitude in inferior leads (1.12 ± 0.32 vs. 0.71 ± 0.24 mV, P = 0.002), R-wave amplitude ratio of leads III/II (0.77 ± 0.10 vs. 0.50 ± 0.23, P = 0.005), incidence of S-wave in lead III [1/8 (13%) vs. 16/17 (94%), P < 0.001], and QS morphology in lead V1 [3/8 (38%) vs. 17/17 (100%), P = 0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: Despite their adjacent locations, para-Hisian VAs could be classified into two subgroups with distinctive electrocardiographic characteristics according to origin either above or below the HB region. The present findings can be helpful for planning catheter ablation of para-Hisian VAs, and can reduce the risk of inadvertent atrioventricular block.
