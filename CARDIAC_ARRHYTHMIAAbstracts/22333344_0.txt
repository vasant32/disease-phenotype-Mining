 BACKGROUND: Myocardial scars harbor areas of slow conduction and display abnormal electrograms. Pace-mapping at these sites can generate a 12-lead ECG morphological match to a targeted ventricular tachycardia (VT), and in some instances, multiple exit morphologies can result. At times, this can also result in the initiation of VT, termed pace-mapped induction (PMI). We hypothesized that in patients undergoing catheter ablation of VT, scar substrates with multiple exit sites (MES) identified during pace-mapping have improved freedom from recurrent VT, and PMI of VT predicts successful sites of termination during ablation. METHODS AND RESULTS: High-density mapping was performed in all subjects to delineate scar (0.5-1.5 mV). Sites with abnormal electrograms were tagged, stimulated (bipolar 10 mA at 2 ms), and targeted for ablation. MES was defined as >1 QRS morphology from a single pacing site. PMI was defined as initiation of VT during pace-mapping (400-600 ms). In a 2-year period, 44 consecutive patients with scar-mediated VT underwent mapping and ablation. MES were observed during pace-mapping in 25 patients (57%). At 9 months, 74% of patients who exhibited MES during pace-mapping had no recurrence of VT compared with 42% of those without MES observed (P=0.024), with an overall freedom from VT of 61%. Thirteen patients (30%) demonstrated PMI, and termination of VT was seen in 95% (18/19) of sites where ablation was performed. CONCLUSIONS: During pace-mapping, electrograms that exhibit MES and PMI may be specific for sites critical to reentry. These functional responses hold promise for identifying important sites for catheter ablation of VT.
