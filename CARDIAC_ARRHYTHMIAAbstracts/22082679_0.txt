 BACKGROUND: Suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) is a key negative-feedback regulator of the gp130 receptor that provides crucial signaling for cardiac hypertrophy and survival; however, an in vivo role of SOCS3 regulation on cardiac gp130 signaling remains obscure. METHODS AND RESULTS: We generated cardiac-specific SOCS3 knockout (SOCS3 cKO) mice. These mice showed increased activation of gp130 downstream signaling targets (STAT3, ERK1/2, AKT, and p38) from 15 weeks of age and developed cardiac dysfunction from approximately 25 weeks of age with signs of heart failure. Surprisingly, SOCS3 cKO failing hearts had minimal histological abnormalities with intact myofibril ultrastructure. In addition, Ca(2+) transients were significantly increased in SOCS3 cKO failing hearts compared with wild-type hearts. We also found that Ser23/24 residues of troponin I were hypophosphorylated in SOCS3 cKO hearts before the manifestation of cardiac dysfunction. These data suggested the presence of abnormalities in myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity in SOCS3 cKO mice. In addition to the contractile dysfunction, we found various ventricular arrhythmias in SOCS3 cKO nonfailing hearts accompanied by a sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) overload. To determine the contribution of gp130 signaling to the cardiac phenotype that occurs with SOCS3 deficiency, we generated cardiac-specific gp130 and SOCS3 double KO mice. Double KO mice lived significantly longer and had different histological abnormalities when compared with SOCS3 cKO mice, thus demonstrating the importance of gp130 signaling in the SOCS3 cKO cardiac phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate an important role of SOCS3 regulation on cardiac gp130 signaling in the pathogenesis of contractile dysfunction and ventricular arrhythmias.
