Central venous catheters (CVCs) provide valuable vascular access. Complications associated with the insertion and maintenance of CVCs includes pneumothorax, arterial puncture, arrhythmias, line fracture, malposition, migration, infection, thrombosis, and fibrin sheath formation. Image-guided CVC placement is now standard practice and reduces the risk of complications compared to the blind landmark insertion technique. This review demonstrates the imaging of a range of complications associated with CVCs and discusses their management with catheter salvage techniques.
