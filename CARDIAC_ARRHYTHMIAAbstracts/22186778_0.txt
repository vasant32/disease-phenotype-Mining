A woman presented with broad complex tachycardia. She was converted to sinus rhythm with intravenous amiodarone and continued on oral amiodarone. The amiodarone was stopped 3 weeks later as she was pregnant. Electrocardiogram (ECG) then revealed coved-type ST elevation in C1, suggestive of Brugada syndrome, and widespread inferior ST elevation. Electrocardiogram several months later showed resolution of inferior ST elevation.
