Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most common type of cardiomyopathy with a prevalence of 1 out of 2,500 in adults. Due to mild clinical symptoms in the early phase of the disease, the true prevalence is probably even much higher. Patients present with variable clinical symptoms ranging from mild systolic impairment of left ventricular function to congestive heart failure. Even sudden cardiac death may be the first clinical symptom of DCM. The severity of the disease is defined by the degree of impairment of global left ventricular function. Arrhythmias, such as ventricular or supraventricular tachycardia, atrioventricular (AV) block, ventricular extrasystole and atrial fibrillation are common cardiac manifestations of DCM. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an important role in the exact quantification of functional impairment of both ventricles and in the evaluation of regional wall motion abnormalities. With its excellent ability for the assessment of myocardial structure, it is becoming increasingly more important for risk stratification and therapy guidance.
