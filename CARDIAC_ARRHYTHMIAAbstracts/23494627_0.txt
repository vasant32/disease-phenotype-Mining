OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study aimed to determine the effect of simultaneous aortic valve replacement (AVR) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on operative outcomes and long-term survival in elderly patients with a high prevalence of comorbidity. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-seven elderly patients (70 years old or older) undergoing isolated AVR (n = 120) or combined AVR/CABG (n = 37) were evaluated. Operative outcomes were compared between the two surgical groups. Long-term survival was also compared between the groups using the Kaplan-Meier method and long-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. RESULTS: Operative mortality was 0.8 % for the isolated AVR group and 5.4 % for the combined AVR/CABG group (p = 0.076). The length of the intensive care unit stay for the combined AVR/CABG group was significantly longer than that for the isolated AVR group (median: 40 vs. 21 h, p = 0.008). However, the occurrence rate of hospital complications, such as reoperation for bleeding, deep sternal infection, supra-ventricular arrhythmia, and neurological complications, was similar between the two groups. Actuarial survival at 3 and 5 years was 82.3 and 80.9 % for the isolated AVR group, and 88.3 and 73.0 % for the combined AVR/CABG group, respectively (p = 0.637). CONCLUSIONS: The satisfactory operative and long-term results in our study support a more aggressive simultaneous coronary revascularization combined with AVR for aortic valve stenosis in elderly patients.
