Ice therapy has long been used as first line treatment of supraventricular tachycardia in neonates. We report a case of cold panniculitis developing in a 12-day-old neonate after ice therapy for cardiac arrhythmia. This is the first biopsy-proved case of cold panniculitis following ice therapy for supraventricular tachycardia in a newborn.
