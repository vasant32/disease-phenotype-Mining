Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia seen in general practice, can be promoted by conduction slowing. Cardiac impulse conduction depends on gap junction channels, which are composed of connexins (Cxs). While atrial Cx40 and Cx43 are equally expressed, AF studies have primarily focused on Cx40 reductions. The G60S Cx43 mutant (Cx43(G60S/+)) mouse model of Oculodentodigital dysplasia has a 60% reduction in Cx43 in the atria. Cx43(G60S/+) mice were compared with Cx40-deficient (Cx40(-/-)) mice to determine the role of Cxs in atrial tachycardia/fibrillation (AT/F). Intracardiac electrophysiological studies were done in 6-mo-old male C57BL/6 Cx43(G60S/+) mutant, littermate (Cx43(+/+)), Cx40(-/-), and C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice. AT/F induction used an extra stimulus during sinus rhythm, programmed electrical stimulation, or burst pacing (1-ms pulses, 50-Hz, 400-ms train) in the absence and presence of carbachol (CCh). Atrial effective refractory periods did not differ between strains. Cx43(G60S/+) mice were more susceptible to induction of sustained AT/F (duration >2 min, 9 of 12; maximum >35 min) compared with Cx43(+/+) mice (3 of 11; χ(2) = 5.24; P = 0.02). CCh enhanced sustained AT/F susceptibility in WT (from 1 of 12 without, to 7 of 10 with CCh; χ(2) = 8.98; P < 0.01) but not in Cx40(-/-) mice (1 of 13 without vs. 2 of 9 with CCh; χ(2) = 0.95; P = NS). The pattern of epicardial recordings during AT/F in Cx43(G60S/+) mice was left preceding right, with left atrial fractionated activation patterns consistent with clinical observations of AF. In conclusions, while Cx43(G60S/+) mice had severe AT/F, Cx40(-/-) mice were resistant to CCh-induced AT/F.
