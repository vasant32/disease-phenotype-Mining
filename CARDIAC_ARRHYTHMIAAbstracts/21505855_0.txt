The presence of cardiac pacemaker systems may significantly limit interpretation of multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) images. In 80 patients (45 men; aged 69.5 Â± 13.4) with previously implanted anti-arrhythmic devices, a 64-slice CT (Aquilion-64) was performed. In 61 patients (76.3%), ECG gating was used (coronaries visualization) and in 19 patients (23.7%) without ECG gating (not coronaries visualization). In all 19 patients without ECG gating MSCT images were diagnostic. In 37 (60.6%) patients of 61, there was no problem with gating process and image quality was diagnostic. In 24 (39.4%) with visible spikes in the ECG-gating group, there were difficulties in differentiating the R spike from an artificial spike (unipolar pacing) by MSCT software. In 15 patients (24.6%) after reprogramming, it was possible to obtain good quality images. In nine (14.7%) patients, it was not possible to reprogram devices due to old unipolar leads, but in two cases (3.3%), ECG gating was corrected manually and good image quality was obtained. In seven (11.5%) patients, it was not possible to perform ECG gating. The ECG gating process was identified as the main cause of the imaging problems. Bipolar leads working as bipolar pacing seem to be necessary to perform MSCT with ECG gating. A unipolar system lead may cause serious problems with reconstructions.
