 OBJECTIVE: To summarize the resection of local advanced upper lung cancer and radical bilateral mediastinal lymph node dissection through a median sternotomy. METHODS: A total of 31 patients with local advanced upper lung cancer underwent lobectomy and radical complete dissection of bilateral superior mediastinal lymph node through a median sternotomy (the sternotomy group). The sternotomy group consisted of 8 females and 23 males, from 35 to 75 years old (average 57 years). Five patients underwent superior vena caval replacement or partial excision, 21 underwent upper sleeve lobectomy, and 6 patients combined with right pulmonary artery sleeve angioplasty or partial resection and reconstruction. Compared with the 30 patients who were operated through posterolateral incision, the surgery time, complications, and prognosis during the same period (the posterolateral incision group) were recorded. RESULTS: There was no perioperative death. The average operation time in the sternotomy group was (170±30)min, while that in the posterolateral incision group was (140±30) min(P>0.05). Postoperative complications comprised atelectasis, cardiac arrhythmia, and pneumonia. In the sternotomy group it was 6.5%(2/31), 16.1%(5/31), and 6.5% (2/31),and that in the posterolateral incision group 3.3%(1/30), 20%(6/30), 10.0%(3/30),respectively. Postoperative pathological findings demonstrated the rate for pN3 disease in the sternotomy group was 29%(9/31), 2 patients died of brain and liver metastasis respectively 10 or 11 months after the operation. The 3 year survival rate of 9 patients with pN3 diagnosed as cN2 preoperatively was 33.3%(3/9). The total survival rate of 1,3 years in the sternotomy group was 90.3%(28/31) and 41.9%(13/31), in the posterolateral incision group 86.6%(26/30) and 40.0%(12/30),respectively(P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Median sternotomy helps to resect local advanced upper lung cancer completely and to dissect bilateral mediastinal lymph node, and it can also provide more complete postoperative lymph node staging with no significant increase in complications.
