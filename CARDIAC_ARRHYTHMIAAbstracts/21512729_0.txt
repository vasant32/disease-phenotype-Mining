Anthracyclines are key drugs for the treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, anthracyclines are known to induce QT prolongation, and life-threatening complications, such as torsades de pointe may also occur. To date, there have been no reports on the use of anthracyclines in patients with congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS). We report a child with ALL complicated by congenital LQTS who was treated with anthracyclines. The administration of anthracyclines caused QT-interval prolongation, but this was uneventful with the concomitant administration of magnesium sulfate.
