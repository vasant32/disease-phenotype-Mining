Idiopathic outflow tract ventricular arrhythmias (IOTVA), including left and right ventricular outflow tract, are dued to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-mediated calcium-dependent delayed after depolarizations. A growing body of evidence suggests that the changes of sex hormone levels and gender differences may affect ventricular repolarization and be associated with the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias. Recent studies showed that the level of estradiol in the IOTVA male patients decreased significantly and the count of ventricular arrhythmias was significantly negatively correlated with the level of estradiol in male patients with IOTVA. Meanwhile, estrogen replacement therapy could inhibit significantly the count of ventricular arrhythmias in the postmenopausal patients with IOTVA. In conclusion, estrogen replacement therapy may be a potential therapeutic approach for IOTVA besides postmenopausal patients.
