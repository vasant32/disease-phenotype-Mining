Transient junctional rhythm late after para-Hisian accessory pathway cryoablation occurred in two patients. Cryoablation was delivered using the 8 mm tip Freezor MAXâ„¢ catheter (Cryocath Technologies Inc., Montreal, Canada), 2 mm distal to the largest His potential. Transient symptomatic junctional rhythm occurred after 1 week. This benign, self-limiting rhythm is possibly caused by reversible cryoinjury to the His bundle periphery.
