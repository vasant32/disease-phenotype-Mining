According to the update of the Finnish guidelines for management of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) dronedarone should be used only in patients with non-permanent AF as a second line medication. It is recommended to monitor the patients regularly and stop dronedarone if permanent AF, heart failure or other adverse events are detected. Dabigatran and rivaroxaban can be used as an alternative to warfarin in patients requiring oral anticoagulation therapy. The selection between warfarin and the new anticoagulants should be based on careful evaluation of the benefits and disadvantages of the drugs in a given patient.
