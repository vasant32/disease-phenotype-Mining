 BACKGROUND: Myocardial ischemia during coronary spasm may generate malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The J-wave pattern was suggested to be a marker of a disorder associated with life-threatening arrhythmias. RESULTS: We report the case of a patient with vasospastic angina and J-wave pattern in inferior and lateral leads associated with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia which was effectively treated only with quinidine-vasodilating drugs were not able to prevent the arrhythmia although they were effective in preventing ischemic events. CONCLUSION: The J-wave pattern in inferolateral leads may be a sign of electrical vulnerability to lethal ventricular arrhythmia in patients suffering from vasospastic angina--quinidine can effectively prevent such arrhythmias in these patients.
