We investigated impact of ivabradine on exercise capacity and quality of life in patients with stable angina and comorbid chronic obstructive pulmonary disease during treatment with -blockers. Ivabradine with -blockers reduced heart rate, increased exercise capacity and improved angina more effective than -blockers only. Quality of life associated with angina  increased in patients with stage I and II chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Addition of  ivabradine to -blockers for 2 month did not produce adverse respiratory effects.
