 OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study is to evaluate the influence of a multidisciplinary model of care on the incidence of postoperative complications after a hip fracture. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort series. SETTING: Level I trauma center. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred six patients with pertrochanteric femur fracture (OTA classification: 31-B1, 31-B2, 31-B3, 31-A1, 31-A2, 31-B3, 32-A1, and 32-A2). INTERVENTION: A multidisciplinary, collaborative model of perioperative care: the Medical Orthopaedic Trauma Service (MOTS). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of in-patient complications, length of in-patient hospitalization, readmission rate after hospital discharge, and postdischarge mortality at 90 days and 1 year. RESULTS: Although there was no change in length of hospitalization, there was a significantly decreased overall incidence of in-patient complications and a decreased incidences of new-onset urinary tract infection and arrhythmias in the MOTS cohort. These differences persisted after controlling for age, comorbidity, gender, ethnicity, type of fracture, and number of days from admission to surgery with a logistic regression model. Subgroup analysis of patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification of 1 or 2 revealed a significantly decreased 90 day readmission rate with the MOTS model, but this did not persist in a regression model (P = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary, collaborative model of care for patients with hip fractures decreases the incidence of postoperative in-patient complications and may influence hospital readmission rates.
