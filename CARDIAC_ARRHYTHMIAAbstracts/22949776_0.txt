The major clinical features of myocardial noncompaction are heart failure, arrhythmias, and thromboembolic events. Prominent myocardial trabeculae and deep recesses characteristic of myocardial noncompaction can cause stagnant blood flow and the formation of left ventricular clots. We describe the case of a 62-year-old woman who presented with symptoms of heart failure secondary to left ventricular noncompaction. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography revealed multiple left ventricular thrombi, which had formed despite the patient's long-term therapy with aspirin. Anticoagulative therapy should be considered for patients with myocardial noncompaction who also have risk factors for thromboembolism, such as atrial fibrillation, a history of systemic embolism, or severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction. However, chronic antiplatelet therapy may not sufficiently prevent clot formation in patients who have myocardial noncompaction and severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
