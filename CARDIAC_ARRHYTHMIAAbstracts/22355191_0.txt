This survey analyses some details of follow-up of patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) in 40 centres-the members of the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) research network. Results of this survey show that practices of CIED follow-up are not homogeneous between EHRA research network centres, and recommended clinical evaluation of the patients regarding possible device up-grade is not always performed. Remote device monitoring appears to be an evolving practice, mostly used in implantable cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator recipients.
