PURPOSE: Romidepsin is a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDI) approved for the treatment of both cutaneous and peripheral T cell lymphoma (CTCL and PTCL). During development, a thorough assessment of cardiac toxicity was performed. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A phase II single-agent non-randomized study of romidepsin was performed in patients with CTCL and PTCL who had progressed after at least one prior systemic therapy. RESULTS: Results for the first 42 patients enrolled on the NCI 1312 Phase II study of romidepsin in CTCL or PTCL demonstrated no cardiac toxicity based on serial electrocardiograms, troponins and MUGA scans/echocardiograms. The cardiac assessments reported herein confirm the safety of romidepsin among 131 enrolled patients, while supporting a role for electrolyte replacement. Heart rate increased an average 11 bpm following romidepsin infusion; there was no evidence of increased arrhythmia. Criteria for potassium/magnesium replacement were met prior to 55% of 1365 romidepsin doses; an association with hypoalbuminemia was confirmed. We propose a mechanism for ST segment flattening and depression, the most common electrocardiogram abnormalities observed: HDI-induced alteration of the activity or expression of KATP channels. In addition, examination of the variants of the active transporter of romidepsin, ABCB1, demonstrated a trend towards smaller heart rate changes in the peri-infusion period among wild type compared to variant diplotypes. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that in the context of appropriate attention to electrolyte levels, the data support the cardiac safety of romidepsin.
