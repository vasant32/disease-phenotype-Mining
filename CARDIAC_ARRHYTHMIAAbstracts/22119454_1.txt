 BACKGROUND: Brugada syndrome is characterized by ST-segment abnormalities in V1-V3. Electrocardiogram (ECG) leads placed in the 3rd and 2nd intercostal spaces (ICSs) increased the sensitivity for the detection of a type I ECG pattern. The anatomic explanation for this finding is pending. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to correlate the location of the Brugada type I ECG with the anatomic location of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). METHODS: Twenty patients with positive ajmaline challenge and 10 patients with spontaneous Brugada type I ECG performed by using 12 right precordial leads underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI). The craniocaudal and lateral extent of the RVOT and maximal RVOT area were determined. Type I ECG pattern and maximal ST-segment elevation were correlated to extent and maximal RVOT area, respectively. RESULTS: In all patients, Brugada type I pattern was found in the 3rd ICS in sternal and left-parasternal positions. RVOT extent determined by using CMRI included the 3rd ICS in all patients. Maximal RVOT area was found in 3 patients in the 2nd ICS, in 5 patients in the 4th ICS, and in 22 patients in the 3rd ICS. CMRI predicted type I pattern with a sensitivity of 97.2%, specificity of 91.7%, positive predictive value of 88.6%, and negative predictive value of 98.0%. Maximal RVOT area coincided with maximal ST-segment elevation in 29 of 30 patients. CONCLUSION: RVOT localization determined by using CMRI correlates highly with the type I Brugada pattern. Lead positioning according to RVOT location improves the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome.
