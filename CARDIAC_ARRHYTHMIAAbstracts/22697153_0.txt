Arrhythmias during pregnancy are not an infrequent problem and present a difficult therapeutic challenge to physicians. Anti-arrhythmic medication is used with some trepidation given concerns for the unborn foetus. Catheter ablation is typically avoided due to concerns regarding foetal exposure to radiation and delayed until the post-partum period. With the availability of three-dimensional mapping systems, catheter ablation may be performed with minimal radiation. We report a pregnant woman who underwent successful ablation of focal atrial tachycardia using three-dimensional electroanatomical mapping with minimal radiation exposure.
