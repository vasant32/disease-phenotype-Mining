Atrial fibrillation (AF) in cardiac surgical patients is detrimental in the long perspective. Concomitant surgical ablation of AF is recommended in guidelines and performed in most centers. The article describes the experiences in a single institution with concomitant surgical argon-based cryoablation in 115 patients using three different application techniques (epicardial left atrium, endocardial left atrium, biatrial cryo-maze) and a structured local follow-up to one year postoperatively. Results showed cryoablation to be safe with few complications related to the ablation procedure and few thromboembolic events. In this study, a complete biatrial lesion set according to the classic Cox-maze III (CM III) lesion pattern yielded a higher success rate than left atrial procedures. At 12 months, patients in sinus or pacing rhythm, free of AF without antiarrhythmic drugs, were 27/39 (69%), 24/32 (74%) and 36/44 (82%) in the EpiLA, EndoLA and cryo-maze groups, respectively. A consistent prospective follow-up is essential not only for research purposes but also for assessing the local results of AF surgery in everyday practice. It may direct and develop the surgical ablation program, guide individual postoperative arrhythmia management and is needed to increase overall quality of surgical AF ablation.
