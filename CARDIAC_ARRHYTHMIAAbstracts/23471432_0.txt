AIMS: Junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery for congenital heart defects is often therapy-resistant and associated with high morbidity and mortality. Improvement of pharmacological therapy is needed.METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analysed the clinical data of four patients with congenital heart defects, who developed post-operative JET and were treated with landiolol hydrochloride, representing all such patients treated at our university. In two patients, landiolol was used after failure of response to anti-arrhythmic therapies, including thermal control, sedation, discontinuation of catecholamines, and pharmacological therapy with nifekalant and amiodarone. Landiolol was used as a first-line therapy in the other two patients. In all patients, landiolol, at a dose ranging from 1.0 to 10.0 Âµg/kg/min, achieved successful sinus conversion within 15 min. No adverse events, such as bradycardia, hypotension, or hypoglycaemia, were encountered in all four patients.CONCLUSION: Although limited to a small and heterogeneous group of patients, the results suggest that landiolol is a potentially useful therapeutic option for the well-known difficult condition of post-operative JET, and warrant further investigation in large-scale controlled studies.
