Four patients with long QT type 2, aged 11 to 18 years from unrelated families, with recurrent syncope and polymorhic ventricular tachycardia were studied. Long QT syndrome was diagnosed in these children at ages 4 to 7 years. Syncope, QT prolongation on electrocardiogram (corrected QT interval ≥ 490 milliseconds), notched T-wave morphology, bradycardia, and polymorphic ventricular arrhythmia were found in all of the patients. The KCNH2-L586M; KCNH2-G604S, KCNH2-L1045F; and a combined mutation KCNH2 T613M + SCN5A R190G were genotyped. Syncope, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks, and tachycardia persisted in these patients, although they were receiving a full dose of β-blocker therapy. Adding a sodium-channel blocker (IC class) led to a reduction in the polymorphic ventricular arrhythmia. No syncope episodes were registered during the patients' 8 to 60 months of follow-up on the combined antiarrhythmic therapy. Further studies are needed to better define the possible role of sodium-channel blockers in patients with long QT type 2.
