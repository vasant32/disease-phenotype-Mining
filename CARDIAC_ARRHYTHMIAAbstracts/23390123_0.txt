 BACKGROUND: Syncope in patients with bifascicular block (BFB) is a common event whose causes might be difficult to assess. METHODS AND RESULTS: Prevention of syncope through permanent cardiac pacing in patients with bifascicular block (PRESS) is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, single-blinded study designed to demonstrate a reduction in symptomatic events in patients with bifascicular block and syncope of undetermined origin implanted with permanent pacemaker. Device programming mode (NASPE/BPEG code) at DDD with a lower rate of 60 ppm is compared with backup pacing at DDI with a lower rate of 30 ppm. The end point consisted of (1) syncope, (2) symptomatic presyncopal episodes associated with a device intervention (ventricular pacing), and (3) symptomatic episodes associated with intermittent or permanent atrioventricular block (any degree). One hundred one patients were enrolled and randomized. Primary end point events at 2 years were observed in 23 patients, with a significant lower incidence in the study group (hazard ratio, 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.10-0.96; P=0.042). Reduction of any symptoms, associated or not with device intervention, was superior in DDD60 compared with DDI30 (hazard ratio, 0.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.78; P=0.0053). Fourteen patients developed other rhythm diseases and met class I indication for pacing. The annual incidence of rhythm disease development was 7.4%. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with bifascicular block and syncope of undetermined origin, the use of a dual chamber pacemaker programmed to DDD60 led to a significant reduction of syncope or symptomatic events associated with a cardioinhibitory origin, compared with DDI30 programming. Symptoms associated with a new onset of rhythm disease were found in 15% of the population at 2 years.
