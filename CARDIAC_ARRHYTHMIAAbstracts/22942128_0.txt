Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is common in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), but the impact of COPD on outcomes after PCI has received limited attention. Consecutive patients with coronary heart disease (n = 5155) undergoing PCI were enrolled in this study; 645 patients (73% men) aged 68.4 ± 13.2 years had COPD and 4510 patients (71% men) aged 64.7 ± 12.1 years did not. During the in-hospital period after PCI, the patients with COPD experienced a significantly higher incidence of angina (P < .001), arrhythmias (P < .001), and composite major adverse cardiac events (MACEs; P < .001) and longer hospital stay (P < .001) than those without COPD. Additionally, severity of COPD (measured by pulmonary function tests) was associated with increased composite MACE (P < .001) and hospital stay (P < .001) after PCI. In conclusion, COPD is associated with significantly increased composite MACE and hospital stay in patients after PCI. Increasing severity of COPD is associated with increased composite MACE and hospital stay after PCI.
