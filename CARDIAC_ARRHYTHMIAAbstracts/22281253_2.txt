 OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine risk factors that predict malignant ventricular arrhythmias (MVA) in Lamin A/C (LMNA) mutation carriers. BACKGROUND: LMNA mutations cause a variety of clinical phenotypes, including dilated cardiomyopathy and conduction disease. Many LMNA mutation carriers have a poor prognosis, because of a high frequency of MVA and progression to end-stage heart failure. However, it is unclear how to identify mutation carriers that are at risk for MVA. METHODS: In this multicenter cohort of 269 LMNA mutation carriers, we evaluated risk factors for MVA, defined as sudden cardiac death, resuscitation, and appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) treatment. RESULTS: In a median follow-up period of 43 months (interquartile range: 17 to 101 months), 48 (18%) persons experienced a first episode of MVA: 11 persons received successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation, 25 received appropriate ICD treatment, and 12 persons died suddenly. Independent risk factors for MVA were nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, left ventricular ejection fraction <45% at the first clinical contact, male sex, and non-missense mutations (ins-del/truncating or mutations affecting splicing). MVA occurred only in persons with at least 2 of these risk factors. There was a cumulative risk for MVA per additional risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: Carriers of LMNA mutations with a high risk of MVA can be identified using these risk factors. This facilitates selection of LMNA mutation carriers who are most likely to benefit from an ICD.
