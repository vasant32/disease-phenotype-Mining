We perform a numerical study of emergent spiral wave activity in a two-dimensional reaction-diffusion-mechanics medium with a regional inhomogeneity in active and passive mechanical properties. We find that self-sustaining spiral wave activity emerges for a wide range of mechanical parameters of the inhomogeneity via five mechanisms. We classify these mechanisms, relate them to parameters of the inhomogeneity, and discuss how these results can be applied to understand the onset of cardiac arrhythmias due to regional mechanical heterogeneity.
