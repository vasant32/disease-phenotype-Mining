 AIMS: Mutations in the lamin A/C gene (LMNA) cause a variety of clinical phenotypes, including dilated cardiomyopathy. LMNA is one of the most prevalent mutated genes in dilated cardiomyopathy, and is associated with a high risk of arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, and heart failure. There are few data on the impact of age and gender on cardiac disease penetrance and mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a multicentre cohort of 269 LMNA mutation carriers, we evaluated gender-specific penetrance of cardiac involvement and major cardiac events. All-cause mortality of mutation carriers [standardized mortality ratio (SMR)] was determined. Cardiac disease penetrance was age dependent and almost complete at the age of 70 years. The presence of an LVEF â‰¤45% was significantly higher in men (P < 0.001). However, there was no difference between genders in the prevalence of atrioventricular block, atrial tachyarrhythmias, and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Malignant ventricular arrhythmias (26% vs. 8%) and end-stage heart failure (28% vs. 14%) were more common in men than in women (P < 0.001 and P = 0.006, respectively). All-cause mortality of mutation carriers was significantly increased [SMR 4.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.8-5.2] between the ages of 15 and 75 years. Mortality in men was higher than in women (hazard ratio 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.3). CONCLUSIONS: This large cohort of LMNA mutation carriers demonstrates a high cardiac disease penetrance and a high mortality in mutation carriers. Male mutation carriers have a worse prognosis due to a higher prevalence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias and end-stage heart failure.
