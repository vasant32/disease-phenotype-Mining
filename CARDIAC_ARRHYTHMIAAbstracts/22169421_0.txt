 OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relationship between electrocardiographic (ECG) features and disease severity in patients with the arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). METHOD: The study group consisted of 61 subjects with a definite diagnosis of ARVC on the basis of published guideline criteria and patients were divided into 3 subgroups according to the extent of diseased myocardium defined by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Group A: local involvement (n = 19, 31%), Group B: diffuse involvement of whole right ventricle (n = 28, 46%) and Group C: involvement of both right and left ventricles (n = 14, 23%). RESULTS: Normal electrocardiogram was shown in 1 patient in each group. Epsilon wave was detected in 24 (39%) patients, QRS duration was prolonged [≥ 110 ms (V(1)-V(3))] in 21 (34%) patients, S-wave upstroke was prolonged (≥ 55 ms) in 17 (28%) patients, complete right branch bundle block was evidenced in 10 (16%) patients and pathologic Q waves was found in 9 (15%) patients. The incidence of above abnormal ECG changes was increased in proportion to the degree of disease severity (group A < group B < group C). Incidence of Epsilon wave and prolonged QRS duration [ ≥ 110 ms (V(1)-V(3))] were significantly higher in Group C than in Group A. Incidence of prolonged S-wave upstroke (≥ 55 ms) was significantly higher in Group C than in Group A and Group B. T-wave inversion in V(1) leads was often found in Group A. T-wave inversion in inferior leads (V(1)-V(3) leads or beyond V(3)) was often presented in Group B and Group C. CONCLUSIONS: Normal ECG does not exclude the possibility of diagnosis of ARVC. The extent of T-wave inversion in the precordial leads and incidence of Epsilon wave, prolonged QRS duration [ ≥ 110 ms (V(1)-V(3))] and prolonged S-wave upstroke (≥ 55 ms) were related to degree of disease severity in patients with ARVC.
