The objective of this multicenter study was to evaluate psychological functioning and disease-related quality of life (DRQoL) in pediatric patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in The Netherlands. Thirty patients were investigated; the mean age was 16.3 years, and the mean duration of implantation was 3.6 years. To assess psychological problems, three domains of the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90-R) were administered to the 25 patients[13 years old. DRQoL was assessed with a disease-specific pediatric questionnaire, the short-form 11-item Worries About (WA)ICDs Scale. Patients C13 years old scored significantly higher than the reference group on the domains of anxiety, depression, and sleeping problems of the SCL-90-R (T = 7.5, p\0.001; T = 5.4, p\0.001; and T = 7.8, p\0.001, respectively). Patients who had received an (in)appropriate shock reported more depressive symptoms (T = 2.1, p\0.03). Patients with [2 years implant duration (N = 19) or who had received an (in)appropriate shock (N = 13) showed lower DRQoL scores on the modified WAICD (T = 2.1, p\0.04; T = 2.1, p\0.5, respectively). Age at implantation or underlying disease did not influence psychological problems or DRQoL. Young ICD patients showed more anxiety, depression, and sleeping disorders. Worries were increased among patients with ICD shocks and in those who had their ICD implanted for[2 years. To determine psychological problems and help children to learn to cope with shocks, proper guidance and monitoring of young ICD patients are recommended.
