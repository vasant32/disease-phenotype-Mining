Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were shown to improve cell survival and alleviate cardiac arrhythmias when transplanted into cardiac tissue; however, little is known about the mechanism by which MSCs modify the electrophysiological properties of cardiac tissue. We aimed to distinguish the influence of cell-cell coupling between myocytes and MSCs from that of MSC-derived paracrine factors on the spontaneous activity and conduction velocity (θ) of multicellular cardiomyocyte preparations. HL-1 cells were plated on microelectrode arrays and their spontaneous activity and θ was determined from field potential recordings. In heterocellular cultures of MSCs and HL-1 cells the beating frequency was attenuated (t(0h): 2.26 ± 0.18 Hz; t(4h): 1.98 ± 0.26 Hz; P < 0.01) concomitant to the intercellular coupling between MSCs and cardiomyocytes. In HL-1 monolayers supplemented with MSC conditioned media (ConM) or tyrode (ConT) θ significantly increased in a time-dependent manner (ConT: t(0h): 2.4 cm/s ± 0.2; t(4h): 3.1 ± 0.4 cm/s), whereas the beating frequency remained constant. Connexin (Cx)43 mRNA and protein expression levels also increased after ConM or ConT treatment over the same time period. Enhanced low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) phosphorylation after ConT treatment implicates the Wnt signaling pathway. Suppression of Wnt secretion from MSCs (IWP-2; 5 μmol/l) reduced the efficacy of ConT to induce phospho-LRP6 and to increase θ. Inhibition of β-catenin (cardamonin; 10 μmol/l) or GSK3-α/β (LiCl; 5 mmol/l) also suppressed changes in θ, further supporting the hypothesis that MSC-mediated Cx43 upregulation occurs in part through secreted Wnt ligands and activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway.
