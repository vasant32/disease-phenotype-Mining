The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator significantly improves survival in patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmias but does not target the underlying pathological substrate responsible for arrhythmic events. A significant proportion of defibrillator recipients experience multiple ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation episodes over a short period of time, termed electrical storm (ES). The current therapeutic strategy for ES is complex and unsatisfactory because simultaneous administration of several medications and additional invasive procedures are often required to control ES. Moreover, this treatment does not favorably influence the long-term outcome. Clearly, improved ES therapies are necessary and desirable, but a lack of understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying ES has hindered the development of more effective, rationally based therapeutic approaches. This paper reviews emerging experimental and clinical findings that provide insights into the pathophysiology of ES and discusses mechanism-based innovative therapeutic strategies.
