 INTRODUCTION: Non-compaction of the ventricular myocardium (NCVM) is a rare congenital heart disease. Heightened awareness has resulted in increased detection of the morphological features of NCVM in routine clinical practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Multicentre study including paediatric patients affected by NCVM according to the echocardiographic criteria of Chin and Jenni. RESULTS: A total of 29 patients were included, 15 female and 14 male, the median age at diagnosis was 5 years and 7 months (birth to 17 years). Sixteen patients (55%) presented as an isolated lesion, 8 (27.5%) had a ventricular septal defect, one of them associated with aortic coarctation, 3 (10%) had an inborn error of metabolism, 1 (3.5%) had Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis and 1 (3.5%) has a syndrome being studied. The location of the trabeculae has been predominantly at the apex, but also affected the left ventricle free wall in 11 patients (40%) and right ventricle in 2 (7%). No complications were present in 12 patients (41%), with cardiac failure in 12 patients (41%), an implantable cardioverter defibrillator was placed for ventricular arrhythmias in 2 patients (7%), stroke, 1 patient (3,5%) and death, 2 patients (7%), both of them less than 6 months of age (P<.05). Median follow up was 12 months (2 months to 8 years). Current treatment includes carvedilol, ACEI's and ASA, and one patient is waiting for a cardiac transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Early onset of symptoms is associated with a poor prognosis. Clinical and prognostic heterogeneity is described.
