The present study was carried out to investigate the protective effects of roots of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge on hypobaric hypoxia. Two extracts of S. miltiorrhiza (extract 1: ethanol : water - 50 : 50; extract 2: 96% ethanol) were used. The experiments were performed after 7 consecutive days of administration of the extracts (200 mg/kg b.w., intragastrically) to male Wistar rats. Next, after placing animals for 60 min in the controlled acute hypobaric hypoxia (500 mm Hg) the systolic arterial blood pressure (SAP) in conscious rats, bioelectric heart activity in unconscious rats and analysis of oxidative stress parameters in the blood of rats: malonyldialdehyde (MDA) and lipid peroxidase (LPO) concentration, activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) or glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were assayed. It was found out that the extract 1 augmented the lowering of SAP shown in hypoxia affected control rats. On the contrary the extract 2 reversed SAP to values obtained in control animals. Moreover, both extracts led to the normalization of hypoxia-induced tachycardia and levels of MDA, LPO and SOD. It seems that the above-mentioned effects are coupled with different active compounds content in the extracts, however more studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.
