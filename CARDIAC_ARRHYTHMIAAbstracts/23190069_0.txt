Chagas disease is the principal cause of chronic heart failure in areas where the disease is endemic. The medical treatment is the same recommended for non-Chagas disease patients. There is no evidence-based medicine support for device therapy in Chagas disease heart failure. Cardiac resynchronization therapy is recommended for Chagas disease heart failure patients with intraventricular conduction disturbances, mainly for those with left bundle branch block, and in advanced congestive heart failure refractory to targeted medical treatment, although this therapy is still polemic in Chagas disease heart failure. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy is indicated to Chagas disease patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <30% for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death. ICD therapy is offered to patients for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death. Patients with moderate left ventricular dysfunction and inducible arrhythmia at electrophysiological testing should receive ICD therapy.
