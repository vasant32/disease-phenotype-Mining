The circular catheter is a useful tool to guide and test pulmonary vein (PV) isolation in atrial fibrillation ablation. However, its shape may facilitate entrapment in cardiac structures. We describe the entrapment of a circular mapping catheter within the mitral valve apparatus after transseptal catheterization and mapping of the left atrium and PVs in two of our patients.
