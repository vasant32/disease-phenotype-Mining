 BACKGROUND: The ECG, clinical, and electrophysiologic profiles of patients with a fasciculoventricular pathway are well described. Fasciculoventricular pathways occurring in the setting of glycogen storage cardiomyopathy possess unique features. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical, ECG, and electrophysiologic characteristics of patients with a fasciculoventricular pathway, with or without glycogen storage cardiomyopathy. METHODS: Two groups of patients with a fasciculoventricular pathway were compared: group A consisted of 10 patients with the PRKAG2 mutation (Arg302gln), and group B consisted of 9 patients without the mutation. RESULTS: Thirty percent of group A patients had left ventricular hypertrophy, and none had an additional accessory pathway. Group B patients had no structural heart disease, and 33% had an additional accessory pathway. Group A patients had a slower resting heart rate (56 ± 7 vs 75 ± 10 bpm, P <0.0001), a wider QRS complex (0.15 ± 0.01 vs 0.11 ± 0.02 ms, P = .0004), and a longer HV interval (34 ± 1 vs 25 ± 3 ms, P = .0003). During long-term follow-up, 50% of group A patients developed complete AV block versus none in group B. Eighty percent of group A patients developed atrial flutter and/or atrial fibrillation. No Group B patient had any arrhythmia during follow-up after successful ablation of additional arrhythmia circuits. No sustained ventricular arrhythmia was induced in any patient from either group. CONCLUSION: Patients with a fasciculoventricular pathway associated with the PRKAG2 mutation have distinct clinical, ECG, and electrophysiologic profiles and should be correctly identified because of their ominous long-term prognosis. Patients without the mutation have an excellent arrhythmia-free prognosis after treatment of additional circuits.
