The study was carried out to see prevalence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) specific cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular events among patients with Chronic Kidney Disease stage-V (CKD-V) before starting dialysis therapy in the department of Nephrology of National Institute of Kidney Diseases & Urology (NIKDU), Dhaka, Bangladesh. Among CKD specific cardiovascular risk factors, anemia showed the highest prevalence (96.7%) in study population. More than fifty percent of CKD-V patients had both hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia. Calcium-Phosphate Product (CaXP) was elevated among 23 percent of the population. C-reactive protein, an acute phase protein was positive in 78% of CKD-V patients. Besides, among traditional risk factors, Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus were present in 83.3% and 23% of the study population respectively. The prevalence of cardiovascular events among CKD-V patients showed that 18.3% had ischemic heart disease, 38% heart failure, 4.7% arrhythmia and 9% left ventricular hypertrophy. Females were significantly prone to develop cardiovascular events than their male counterpart (p=0.028). Diabetes was significantly higher in patients with cardiovascular complications than in patients without cardiovascular complications (p=0.021).
