 BACKGROUND: Early arrhythmia recurrences after pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for atrial fibrillation (AF) are accepted as part of the blanking period. Their relevance for long-term efficacy is not well-known. We evaluated patients, who came to hospital with a documented recurrence of AF, or had a registered episode of AF on the 24-hour Holter 6weeks after PVI and compared it with long-term outcome. METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients with paroxysmal AF were treated with the PVAC. In the 3-month blanking period patients who came to hospital with a documented recurrence of AF on ECG were recorded. 6weeks after procedure a 24-hour Holter was performed. After 3months patients were asked if they felt a relapse. Follow-up was performed at 3, 6, and 12months with ECG, 7-day Holter at 6 and/or 12months, and event recording if needed. RESULTS: Within the blanking period, 25/100 (25%) patients had a documented recurrence of AF while 46/100 (46%) patients felt a relapse. After the blanking period up to 12months, 53/100 (53%) patients were free of AF without anti-arrhythmic drugs. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that absence of AF in the blanking period (OR 0.22 95%CI [0.05-0.98]) and absence of a relapse of symptoms suspect for AF during the blanking period (OR 0.21 95%CI [0.06-0.52]) were independent predictors of successful long-term outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Poor long-term outcome is strongly related to patients who experienced palpitations with ECG documented AF, AF on the 24-hour Holter at 6weeks after PVI and a relapse in the blanking period.
