BACKGROUND: -We considered the role of programmed ventricular stimulation (PVS) in primary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in an idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) population. METHODS AND RESULTS: -158 IDCM patients underwent PVS. Ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) was triggered in 44 patients (group I, 27.8%) versus 114 patients (group II) where VT/VF was not induced. Sixty-nine IDCM patients underwent ICD implantation: 41/44 in Group I and 28/114 in Group II. The major end-points of the study were overall mortality and appropriate ICD activation. Overall mortality during the 46.9 months of mean follow-up was not significantly different between the two groups. Patients with left ventriculat ejection fraction (LVEF) â‰¤35% (n=119) demonstrated a higher overall mortality rate compared to the patients with LVEF>35% (n=39) (16.8% vs. 10.3%, log rank p=0.025). Advanced NYHA class (III-IV vs I-II) was the single independent and strongest prognostic factor of overall mortality (HR 11.909, p<0.001, CI: 3.106-45.65), as well as of cardiac mortality (HR 14.787, p=0.001, CI: 2.958-73.922). Among ICD recipients, ICD activation rate was significantly higher in group I compared to group II (30/41 patients-73.2% vs. 5/28 patients-17.9%, log-rank p=0.001), either in the form of antitachycardia pacing (68.3% vs. 17.9%, log-rank p=0.001) or in the shock delivery form (51.2% vs. 17.9%, log-rank p=0.05). Induction of VT/VF during PVS in contrast to LVEF was the single independent prognostic factor for future ICD activation (HR 4.195, p=0.007, CI: 1.467-11.994). CONCLUSIONS: -Inducibility of VT/VF was associated with an increased likelihood of subsequent ICD activation and SCD surrogate.
