The unique gating kinetics of hERG K(+) channels are critical for normal cardiac repolarization, and patients with mutations in hERG have a markedly increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac arrest. HERG K(+) channels are also remarkably promiscuous with respect to drug binding, which has been a very significant problem for the pharmaceutical industry. Here, we review the progress that has been made in understanding the structure and function of hERG K(+) channels with a particular focus on nuclear magnetic resonance studies of the domains of the hERG K(+) channel.
