 OBJECTIVE: To compare the results of retroperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy using the antegrade and retrograde approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an analysis of a single-center series of 279 retroperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomies from 1996 to 2010. We compared 172 cases performed with an antegrade approach and 107 with a retrograde approach without dissection of the renal hilum and initial control of the adrenal vein in comparable populations. RESULTS: The operative time was shorter in the group treated with the retrograde technique, 101±51 vs 140±40 minutes, respectively (Student's t test, P<.001). Blood loss was similar in both groups, 85±224 vs 80±126 mL, respectively (P=NS). Hemodynamic instability was defined as the maximal systolic blood pressure minus the minimal systolic blood pressure divided the maximal systolic blood pressure. It was lower in the group who underwent the retrograde technique (32.7 vs 37.6 mL; Student's t test, P=.005) with a lower perioperative consumption of ephedrine (2.2 vs 5.1 mg, P=.004) and atropine (0.09 vs 0.22 mg, P=.026). No difference was found between the 2 groups in the frequency of perioperative complications or postoperative mortality (1 death in each group of causes unrelated to the surgery). CONCLUSION: Retroperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy using a retrograde approach is a safe and reproducible technique. It makes it possible to perform adrenalectomy without dissection of the renal hilum, with a reduction in the operative time. The good hemodynamic stability observed with this technique makes it very attractive for the treatment of pheochromocytoma.
