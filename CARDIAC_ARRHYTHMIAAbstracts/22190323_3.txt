Flecainide acetate is a classic Ic antiarrhythmic agent used to treat a variety of cardiac arrhythmias. Non-cardiac side effects usually affect the central nervous system. Few case reports of possible flecainide-induced peripheral neuropathy have been reported. We report this unique case in that flecainide-induced sensory neuropathy was confirmed with skin biopsy, and subsequent improvement of neuropathy was documented with assessment of intraepidermal nerve fiber density in a repeat nerve biopsy.
