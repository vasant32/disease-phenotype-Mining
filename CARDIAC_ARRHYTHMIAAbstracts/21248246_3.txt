 BACKGROUND: Steerable sheath technology is designed to facilitate catheter access, stability, and tissue contact in target sites of atrial fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation. We hypothesized that rhythm control after interventional AF treatment is more successful using a steerable as compared with a nonsteerable sheath access. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred thirty patients with paroxysmal or persistent drug-refractory AF undergoing their first ablation procedure were prospectively included in a randomized fashion in 2 centers. Ablation was performed by 10 operators with different levels of clinical experience. Treatment outcome was measured with serial 7-day Holter ECGs and additional symptom-based arrhythmia documentation. Single procedure success (freedom from AF and/or atrial macroreentrant tachycardia) was significantly higher in patients ablated with a steerable sheath (78% versus 55% after 3 months, P=0.005; 76% versus 53% after 6 months, P=0.008). Rate of pulmonary vein isolation, procedure duration, and radiofrequency application time did not differ significantly, whereas fluoroscopy time was lower in the steerable sheath group (33±14 minutes versus 45±17 minutes, P<0.001). Complication rates showed no significant difference (3.2% versus 5%, P=0.608). On multivariable analysis, steerable sheath usage remained the only powerful predictor for rhythm outcome after 6 months of follow-up (hazard ratio, 2.837 [1.197 to 6.723]). CONCLUSIONS: AF catheter ablation using a manually controlled, steerable sheath for catheter navigation resulted in a significantly higher clinical success rate, with comparable complication rates and with a reduction in periprocedural fluoroscopy time.
