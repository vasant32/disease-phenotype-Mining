Aims: The absolute white blood cell (WBC) count and neutrophil to lymphocyte (N/L) ratio are predictors of death/myocardial infarction in patients who have undergone coronary angiography. We hypothesized that a pre-procedural elevated WBC count and an elevated N/L ratio would be a predictor of development of significant ventricular arrhythmias in subjects undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods and Results-We retrieved the data for all patients developing ventricular arrhythmia during PCI between 1999 to 2009 from our cath lab database (from 30,798 records), a total of 70 patients (Group I), and tabulated their WBC counts and absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts as well as N/L ratios. We compared the data with a random group of age, gender, medications and pre-existing condition matched controls (n=70) (Group II). We also adjusted for amount of myocardium under jeopardy. Group I had a significantly higher total WBC count (means 14,344 Vs 6852; 95% CI; p=0.0004); neutrophil count (means 75.79% Vs 58.06%; 95% CI; p<0.0001) and N/L ratio (means 3.79 Vs 1.56; 95% CI; p<0.0001)[means compared with t test]. Conclusion: Our data suggests a pre-procedural elevated WBC count, neutrophils and elevated N/L ratio are predictors of significant ventricular arrhythmias in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
