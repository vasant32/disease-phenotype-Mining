 OBJECTIVE: Pharmacologic cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) is a reasonable mode of treatment if the arrhythmia is of recent onset. Results concerning the response rates of different drugs, respectively, in daily clinical practice and data with regard to the parameters associated with successful cardioversion are not very prevalent. METHODS: Three-hundred seventy-six patients who were admitted to the emergency department with acute AF and a duration of shorter than 48 hours were enrolled into the AF registry. RESULTS: The most effective drugs were flecainide and ibutilide (95% and 76%). Low response rates were observed with amiodarone (36%) and the individual use of digoxin or diltiazem (19% and 18%). Factors associated with a successful cardioversion were a lower blood pressure on admission (P = .002), a shorter time interval between the onset of AF and admission to the ED (P = .003), and adherence to treatment guidelines (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: The use of flecainide and ibutilide is associated with a much higher rate of cardioversion than other drugs we studied.
