In this paper, a person identification mechanism implemented with Cardioid based graph using electrocardiogram (ECG) is presented. Cardioid based graph has given a reasonably good classification accuracy in terms of differentiating between individuals. However, the current feature extraction method using Euclidean distance could be further improved by using Mahalanobis distance measurement producing extracted coefficients which takes into account the correlations of the data set. Identification is then done by applying these extracted features to Radial Basis Function Network. A total of 30 ECG data from MITBIH Normal Sinus Rhythm database (NSRDB) and MITBIH Arrhythmia database (MITDB) were used for development and evaluation purposes. Our experimentation results suggest that the proposed feature extraction method has significantly increased the classification performance of subjects in both databases with accuracy from 97.50% to 99.80% in NSRDB and 96.50% to 99.40% in MITDB. High sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of 99.17%, 99.91% and 99.23% for NSRDB and 99.30%, 99.90% and 99.40% for MITDB also validates the proposed method. This result also indicates that the right feature extraction technique plays a vital role in determining the persistency of the classification accuracy for Cardioid based person identification mechanism.
