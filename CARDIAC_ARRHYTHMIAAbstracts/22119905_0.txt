Resting heart rate represents a cardiovascular risk indicator and an important target of therapy in chronic heart failure and potentially in coronary artery disease. Clinical and experimental evidence suggests that sustained elevation of heart rate - independent of the underlying trigger - plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of vascular disease. Results of the SHIFT trial support the importance of heart-rate reduction with ivabradine for improvement of clinical outcomes in heart failure and confirm the role of heart rate as a risk factor for patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction. Results of the BEAUTIFUL trial show that patients with ischemic heart disease and a heart rate above 70Â bpm exhibit an adverse prognosis concerning coronary events.
