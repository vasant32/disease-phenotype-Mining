Brugada Syndrome is a genetic cardiac disease characterized by electrocardiogram changes consisting of an incomplete right bundle branch block, and ST-segment elevations in right precordial leads V1-V3. These patients are at high risk for developing spontaneous arrhythmias that can be fatal. Many factors during general anesthesia, such as medications, temperature changes, and heart rate variations, could precipitate lethal arrhythmias in this patient population. This case report describes a case of general anesthesia for a patient with known Brugada syndrome.
