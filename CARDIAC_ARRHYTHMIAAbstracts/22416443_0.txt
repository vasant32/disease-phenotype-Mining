 AIM: To specify the relationship between content of total body water and recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF) of non-valvular etiology. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pharmacological amiodaron cardioversion followed by amiodaron supportive anti-arrhythmic therapy was made in 76 patients (47 males, 29 females, mean age 58 +/- 8 years) with persistent AF of non-valvular etiology. Measurements were made of the height, body mass, arm circumference, thickness of the lipocutaneous fold above the biceps. Body mass index (BMI) and arm muscular circumference were estimated. Body composition was calculated according to Watson formula. RESULTS: Fifty three (70%) patients with recurrent AF had overweight or obesity. Body fat mass in patients with frequent (1 recurrence and more for 3 months) and rare AF recurrences did not significantly differ (24.4 +/- 10.6 and 30.0 +/- 13.8 kg, respectively; p = 0.064). Total body water was significantly less (36.8 +/- 5.2 and 42.7 +/- 5.4 kg, respectively; p = 0.0009) in patients with frequent AF recurrences. Multifactor regression analysis showed that content of total body water, irrespective of gender and age, inversely correlates with an early AF recurrence (R2 = 0.24; beta = -0.49; p = 0.0003). CONCLUSION: Low content of body water is associated with a risk of early AF recurrence.
