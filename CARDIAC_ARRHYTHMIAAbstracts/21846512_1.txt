Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) is one of the leading causes of heart failure with high morbidity and mortality. More than 30 genes have been reported to cause DCM. To provide new insights into the pathophysiology of dilated cardiomyopathy, a mutational screening on 4 DCM-causing genes (MYH7, TNNT2, TNNI3 and LMNA) was performed in a cohort of 105 unrelated DCM (64 familial cases and 41 sporadic cases) using a High Resolution Melting (HRM)/sequencing strategy. Screening of a highly conserved arginine/serine (RS)-rich region in exon 9 of RBM20 was also performed. Nineteen different mutations were identified in 20 index patients (19%), including 10 novels. These included 8 LMNA variants in 9 (8.6%) probands, 5 TNNT2 variants in 5 probands (4.8%), 4 MYH7 variants in 3 probands (3.8%), 1 TNNI3 variant in 1 proband (0.9%), and 1 RBM20 variant in 1 proband (0.9%). One proband was double-heterozygous. LMNA mutations represent the most prevalent genetic DCM cause. Most patients carrying LMNA mutations exhibit conduction system defects and/or cardiac arrhythmias. Our study also showed than prevalence of mutations affecting TNNI3 or the (RS)-rich region of RBM20 is lower than 1%. The discovery of novel DCM mutations is crucial for clinical management of patients and their families because pre-symptomatic diagnosis is possible and precocious intervention could prevent or ameliorate the prognosis.
