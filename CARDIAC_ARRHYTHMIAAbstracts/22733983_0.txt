 AIMS: High-grade conduction disturbances requiring permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation occur in up to 40% of patients following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The aim of this study was to identify pre-operative risk factors for PPM implantation after TAVI with the Medtronic CoreValve prosthesis (CVP). METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analysed 109 patients following transfemoral CVP implantation performed between 2008 and 2009 at the Leipzig Heart Center. Patients who had indwelling PPM at the time of TAVI (n = 21) were excluded, leaving 88 patients for analysis. Mean age was 80.3 ± 6.6 years and logistic EuroScore predicted risk of mortality was 23.3 ± 12.1%. A total of 32 patients (36%) underwent PPM implantation post-TAVI during the same hospital admission. A total of 27/88 (31%) had evidence of pre-operative abnormal conduction, including first degree AV block and left bundle brunch block. Statistically significant risk factors for the need for post-operative PPM were patient age >75 years [P = 0.02, odds ratio (OR) 4.6], pre-operative heart rate <65 beats per minute (b.p.m.; P = 0.04, OR 2.9), CVP oversizing >4 mm (P = 0.03, OR 2.8), CVP prosthesis >26 mm (OR 2.2), atrial fibrillation (P = 0.001, OR 5.2), and ventricular rate <65 b.p.m. at the first post-operative day (P = 0.137, OR 6.0). CONCLUSION: PPM implantation occurs frequently after transfemoral TAVI with the CVP. Older age, chronic atrial fibrillation, pre-operative bradycardia, and larger or significantly oversized prostheses were independent risk factors for PPM implantation following TAVI with the CVP.
