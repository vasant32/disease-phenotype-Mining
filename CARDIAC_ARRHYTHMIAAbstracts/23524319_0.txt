BACKGROUND: Catheter-tissue contact force (CF) determines radiofrequency (RF) ablation lesion size. Impedance changes during RF delivery are used as a surrogate for CF. The relationship between impedance and real time CF in humans remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether impedance changes have predictive value for real-time CF during catheter ablation of atrial arrhythmias. METHODS: Real-time CF, force-time integral (FTI) and impedance were measured in 2265 RF lesions for atrial fibrillation or flutter in 34 patients. Operators were blinded to CF measurements. Impedance pre-ablation, at 5s intervals for 30s post RF onset and maximal impedance fall during RF were correlated with CF. Average CF was categorized into low (≤ 20g), intermediate (21-60g) or high (>60g). RESULTS: Pre-ablation impedance poorly correlated with pre-ablation CF (R=.07). Maximal impedance fall modestly correlated with average CF and FTI (R=.32 and .37 respectively). There was a large degree of overlap in impedance fall between different CF categories. A maximal impedance fall of 10Ω could predict average CF of >20g with sensitivity and specificity of 71% and 53% and positive and negative predictive values of 51% and 49% respectively. Impedance fall was only able to differentiate between different CF categories ≥15 seconds post RF onset. Higher contact forces moderately correlated with delayed plateau in impedance (R=.41). CONCLUSIONS: Impedance measurements (both baseline and impedance fall) are, at best, moderately efficacious as surrogate markers for predicting real-time catheter-tissue CF. These findings highlight the importance of real-time CF measurements, rather than impedance changes to optimize ablation efficacy.
