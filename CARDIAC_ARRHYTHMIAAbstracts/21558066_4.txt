 BACKGROUND: Supraventricular arrhythmias (SVA) are common after thoracic surgery and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examined the effects of perioperative magnesium on the development of postoperative SVA. METHODS: Two hundred patients undergoing thoracotomy for lobectomy, bi-lobectomy, pneumonectomy, or oesophagectomy were recruited and randomly allocated into two groups. The treatment group received magnesium (5 g daily) intraoperatively, and on days 1 and 2 after operation, the control group received placebo. The primary outcome of the study was the development of SVA within the first 5 days after operation. RESULTS: There were 100 patients in each arm of the study, with one withdrawal and three lost to follow-up in the treatment group and four withdrawals in the control group. Ninety-six patients received magnesium and 96 received placebo. There was no difference in the incidence of SVA between the treatment and control groups, 16.7% (16/96) vs 25% (24/96), P=0.16. In the predefined subgroup analysis, patients at highest risk of arrhythmias (those undergoing pneumonectomy) had a significant reduction in the frequency of SVA, 11.1% (2/18) vs 52.9% (9/17), P=0.008. There were no differences in hospital length of stay or mortality. Patients receiving i.v. magnesium experienced a higher frequency of minor side-effects (stinging at injection site). The treatment was otherwise well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, prophylactic magnesium did not reduce the incidence of SVA in patients undergoing thoracotomy. However, it reduced the incidence of SVA in the high-risk cohort of patients undergoing pneumonectomy. (ISRCTN22028180.).
