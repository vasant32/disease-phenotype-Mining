 AIMS: The remote monitoring of pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) promotes accurate supervision of the patient and device. Alert settings appear to be a crucial parameter of its efficacy. The purpose of our study was to evaluate various settings for alerts and alert message management in patients with pacemakers and ICDs. METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively evaluated 282 patients (181 males, 101 females, mean age 72 ± 11 years) who were referred to nine electrophysiological centres in the Veneto region of Italy for a pacemaker (76 patients) or ICD (206 patients) implant in which remote monitoring was activated (Biotronik Home Monitoring®, Biotronik, Berlin, Germany). During a mean follow-up of 382 ± 261 days, we received 106,039 transmissions. In the pacemaker group, the alerts that were most frequently activated were those concerning battery exhaustion, surveying impedances, sensing and threshold measurements, as well as missing transmissions. In the ICD/ICD-cardiac resynchronization therapy group, the alerts nearly always activated were those concerning a detection setoff, battery exhaustion, critical values of impedance, or ineffective maximum energy shock. In both groups, the alarms for heart rate monitoring and supraventricular arrhythmia were activated in fewer cases at higher variability among centres. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that more attention is paid to critical technical data than to patients' clinical profiles, probably to limit an excessive flow of data into the centre. Accurate alert settings, personalized to the patients' features, are essential for easier and more effective management of patients who are followed remotely.
