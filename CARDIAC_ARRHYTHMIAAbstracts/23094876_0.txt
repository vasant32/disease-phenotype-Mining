Brugada syndrome is a channelopathy characterized on ECG by coved ST-segment elevation (â‰¥2 mm) in the right precordial leads and is associated with an increased risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The term Brugada phenocopy is proposed to describe conditions that induce Brugada-like ECG manifestations in patients without true Brugada syndrome. An extensive review of the literature identified case reports that were classified according to their suspected etiological mechanism. Future directions to learn more about these intriguing cases is discussed.
