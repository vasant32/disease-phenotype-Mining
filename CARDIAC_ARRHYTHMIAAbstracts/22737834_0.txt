Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia associated with major morbidity and mortality. Atrial enlargement, remodeling, and fibrosis are key to initiation and perpetuation of AF. Therapy for AF is directed at symptom control via rate or rhythm control, as well as prevention of thromboembolic events. In the recent past multiple alternatives, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological, have emerged as possible therapies for AF. In this review, we intend to summarize the most important advances in AF therapy in recent years.
