BACKGROUND: -Left atrial (LA) ganglionated plexi (GP) are part of the intrinsic cardiac autonomic nervous system and implicated in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF). High frequency stimulation (HFS) is used to identify GP sites in humans. The effect of ablation on neural pathways connecting GPs in humans is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: -30 patients undergoing LA ablation with autonomic modification were recruited. In patients with persistent AF, endocardial cont-HFS identified GP sites producing AV block. Following right lower GP (RLGP) ablation (N=5), 2 of 15 sites remained positive whereas following ablation of other GPs (N=5), leaving RLGP intact, all 19 sites remained positive (RLGP vs Other GP p<0.005), indicating that neural pathways between LA GPs and the AV node are via the RLGP. In 20 patients with paroxysmal AF, sync-HFS identified sites initiating PV ectopy. Following PV isolation (N=8) no sites remained positive. Following local GP ablation (N=9) 3 of 14 sites remained positive suggesting neural connections to the PV were disrupted by both PVI and GP ablation. Heart rate variability indices reduced significantly after right upper GP (RUGP) ablation alone, suggesting that neural pathways from the LA to the SA node travel via the RUGP. CONCLUSIONS: -We have demonstrated neural pathways connecting LA GPs with the PVs, AV node and SA node. The effects of HFS at GP sites can be prevented by ablating the GP site or the neural pathway. This further delineates the mechanism via which PV isolation prevents AF and highlights important caveats for autonomic modification endpoints.
