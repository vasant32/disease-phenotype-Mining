To study the clinical presentation of the first episode of atrial fibrillation (AF), treatment tactics and its compliance with current recommendations, features of the further clinical course and prognosis in patients with AF we performed a retrospective study on data of Polyclinic No 1 of the General Management Department of the President of RF . We analyzed data from 58 patients (36 men, 22 women) from January 2009 to September 2011 inclusive. The first episode of AF was recorded in the age from 48 to 90 years (in 39.7% of patients - aged 80 to 90 years old), mostly had paroxysmal character (84.5%), in 82.1% of cases was accompanied by marked clinical symptoms: sense of disruption of the heart (50%), feeling short of breath (28.6%), weakness (17.9%). In 87% of casesclinical symptomatology required calls for medical emergencies. In 42.9% of cases uncontrolled hypertension was possible predisposing factor for developing AF. Paroxysmal AF moved to constant in 38.8% of patients during the period from 1 year to 18 years. Due to the high risk of thromboembolic complications (2 to 5 on a scale of CHADS2), after the detection AF warfarin was shown to 96.6% of patients, because of the high risk of bleeding in practice was appointed only 37.9%. Complications of therapy in the form of bleeding were 9.1%. Tactics of rhythm control by antiarrhythmic drugs I and III classes has remained in 36.7% of patients with paroxysmal AF. -adrenoblockers were constantly taken by 63.3% of the patients using antiarrhythmic drugs I and III classes for relief of arrhythmia during her recurrence (the strategy of "pill in pocket").
