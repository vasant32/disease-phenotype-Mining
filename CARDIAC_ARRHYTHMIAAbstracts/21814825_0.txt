 BACKGROUND: Although pulmonary vein isolation is an effective treatment for recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF), there is no consensus on the definition of success or follow-up strategies. Existing data are limited to intermittent Holter or transtelephonic monitoring with reliance on patient symptoms. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the outcomes of surgical ablation and post-ablation AF surveillance with a leadless implantable cardiac monitor (ICM). METHODS: Forty-five patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal or persistent AF underwent video-assisted epicardial ablation using a bipolar radiofrequency clamp. An ICM was implanted subcutaneously post-ablation to assess AF recurrence. AF recurrence was defined as ≥1 AF episode with a duration of ≥30 s. The device-stored data was downloaded weekly over the internet, and all transmitted events were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 1,220 AF automatic and patient-activated AF episodes were analyzed over a follow-up of 12 ± 3 months. Of these episodes, 46% were asymptomatic. Furthermore, only 66% of the patient-activated episodes were AF. AF recurrence was highest in first 4 weeks and substantially decreased 6 months post-ablation. The overall freedom from AF recurrence at the end of follow-up was 60%. When 48-h Holter recordings were compared with the device-stored episodes, the sensitivity of the device to detect AF was 98%, and the specificity was 71%. CONCLUSIONS: The ICM provides an objective measure of AF ablation success and may be useful in making clinical decisions. This device may be used in future ablation studies to develop a more rigorous definition of procedural success.
