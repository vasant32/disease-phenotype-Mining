This report describes a case of atrial flutter in a fetal/neonatal patient who did not respond to adenosine, a propafenone bolus, and three electrical external cardioversions. A fourth direct current cardioversion after propafenone premedication resolved the atrial flutter. The arrhythmia did not recur with propafenone therapy during a 12-month follow-up period.
