Electrical alternans is a broad term that describes alternate-beat variation in the direction, amplitude and duration of any component of the ECG wave-form. It is associated with cardiac tamponade, serious ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden death. We present the clinical case of a 77-year-old female with electrical alternans, from which a diagnosis of cardiac tamponade was established.
