ABSTRACT: The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is the treatment of choice for life-threatening arrhythmias. Usually, the device is placed, by a subclavian access, on the upper portion of the pectoralis major muscle. As a result, the visibility of the device and the wide subclavian scar create an important aesthetic deformity, especially in young women, evolving in a relevant psychosocial distress. The authors report their experience with subpectoral ICD implantation. Between January 2001 and December 2011, approximately30 consecutive female patients underwent submuscular ICD implantation or substitution, performed in collaboration with the cardiology team. No significant complications, except 1 case of wound dehiscence and 2 cases of caudal dislocation of the device, were observed. At 6 and 12 months' follow-up, no significant difference between preoperative and postoperative breast symmetry and volume was noticed. The combined approach aims at reducing the visible signs of the procedure and improving the psychological outcomes.
