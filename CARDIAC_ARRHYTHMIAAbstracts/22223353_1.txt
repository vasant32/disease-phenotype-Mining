 RATIONALE: Diastolic spontaneous Ca(2+) waves (DCWs) are recognized as important contributors to triggered arrhythmias. DCWs are thought to arise when [Ca(2+)] in sarcoplasmic reticulum ([Ca(2+)](SR)) reaches a certain threshold level, which might be reduced in cardiac disease as a consequence of sensitization of ryanodine receptors (RyR2s) to luminal Ca(2+). OBJECTIVE: We investigated the mechanisms of DCW generation in myocytes from normal and diseased hearts, using a canine model of post-myocardial infarction ventricular fibrillation (VF). METHODS AND RESULTS: The frequency of DCWs, recorded during periodic pacing in the presence of a Î²-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol, was significantly higher in VF myocytes than in normal controls. Rather than occurring immediately on reaching a final [Ca(2+)](SR), DCWs arose with a distinct time delay after attaining steady [Ca(2+)](SR) in both experimental groups. Although the rate of [Ca(2+)](SR) recovery after the SR Ca(2+) release was similar between the groups, in VF myocytes the latency to DCWs was shorter, and the [Ca(2+)](SR) at DCW initiation was lower. The restitution of depolarization-induced Ca(2+) transients, assessed by a 2-pulse protocol, was significantly faster in VF myocytes than in controls. The VF-related alterations in myocyte Ca(2+) cycling were mimicked by the RyR2 agonist, caffeine. The reducing agent, mercaptopropionylglycine, or the CaMKII inhibitor, KN93, decreased DCW frequency and normalized restitution of Ca(2+) release in VF myocytes. CONCLUSIONS: The attainment of a certain threshold [Ca(2+)](SR) is not sufficient for the generation of DCWs. Postrelease Ca(2+) signaling refractoriness critically influences the occurrence of DCWs. Shortened Ca(2+) signaling refractoriness due to RyR2 phosphorylation and oxidation is responsible for the increased rate of DCWs observed in VF myocytes and could provide a substrate for synchronization of arrhythmogenic events at the tissue level in hearts prone to VF.
