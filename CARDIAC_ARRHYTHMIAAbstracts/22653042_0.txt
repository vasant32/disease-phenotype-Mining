 AIM: Same-day discharge (SDD) in the setting of catheter ablation (CA) is not widely applied. We present our experience concerning SDD in a selected population of patients who underwent CA; the outcome was evaluated in terms of feasibility and safety. METHODS: 401 CA procedures were performed at our institution between January 2008 and December 2009 in 379 patients (65Â±16 years, 221 men). 336 CA procedures (84%) were considered eligible for SDD, after the exclusion of ventricular arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, atypical atrial flutter, AV node ablation as well as procedures involving an arterial or transseptal access. Subsequently, a number of clinical and organizational exclusion criteria were applied. RESULTS: 223 patients were actually discharged on the same day of CA (56% of 401 overall CA procedures): 114 atrial flutter (AFL) and 109 supraventricular tachycardia. Many patients were excluded before CA due to a limited availability of the day-hospital facility; this occurred more frequently in the year 2008 than 2009 (45 vs. 2, P=0.0001); in the year 2009 the rate of total CA procedures which underwent SDD was of 68%. Overall, three groin hematomas occurred, all in patients ablated for AFL. Two of them were recognized during the postablation CONCLUSION: SDD can be safely performed in most patients undergoing CA for routine arrhythmias. This may result in a significant impact on daily practice in terms of both organizational improvement and subjective benefit for the patients.
