We present a case of a young patient, whose first manifestation of isolated ventricular noncompaction (IVNC) was sudden cardiac arrest precipitated by ventricular fibrillation. Furthermore we had the rare opportunity to record the onset of subsequent episodes of ventricular fibrillation-with discussion on the mechanisms of ventricular arrhythmias in IVNC. (PACE 2012;1-3).
