 BACKGROUND: Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC) is considered a predominantly right ventricular (RV) desmosomal disease. However, left-dominant forms due to desmosomal gene mutations, including PKP2 variant c.419C>T, have been described. Recently, a nondesmosomal phospholamban (PLN) mutation (c.40_42delAGA) has been identified, causing dilated cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias. OBJECTIVE: To gain more insight into pathogenicity of the PKP2 variant c.419C>T by cosegregation analysis of the PKP2 variant c.419C>T vs the PLN mutation c.40_42delAGA. METHODS: A Dutch family (13 family members, median age 49 years, range 34-71 years) with ventricular tachycardia underwent (1) meticulous phenotypic characterization and (2) screening of 5 desmosomal genes (PKP2, DSC2, DSG2, DSP, JUP) and PLN. RESULTS: Six family members fulfilled 2010 AC Task Force Criteria. Seven had signs of left ventricular (LV) involvement (inverted T waves in leads V4-V6, LV wall motion abnormalities and late enhancement, and reduced LV ejection fraction), including 6 family members with proven AC. The PKP2 variant c.419C>T was found as a single variant in 3 family members, combined with the PLN mutation c.40_42delAGA in 3 others. PLN mutation was found in 9 family members, including the 6 with AC and all 7 with LV involvement. The PLN mutation c.40_42delAGA was found as a single mutation in 6, combined with the PKP2 variant c.419C>T in 3 others. A low-voltage electrocardiogram was seen in 4 of 9 PLN mutation-positive subjects. None of the family members with the single PKP2 variant showed any sign of RV or LV involvement. CONCLUSIONS: The PLN mutation c.40_42delAGA cosegregates with AC and with electrocardiographic and structural LV abnormalities. In this family, there was no evidence of disease-causing contribution of the PKP2 variant c.419C>T.
