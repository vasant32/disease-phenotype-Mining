Young women who require aortic valve replacement need information on the potential cardiac and obstetric complications of pregnancy for the different valve substitutes available. We, therefore, assessed the pregnancy outcomes in women who had received an autograft, homograft, or mechanical valve in the aortic position. Women who were pregnant after surviving aortic valve replacement at our institution from 1987 to 2011 were included. Information on cardiac status and pregnancy outcome was obtained through the hospital medical records and by an extensive patient questionnaire. A total of 40 women experienced 67 pregnancies, of which 55 (82%) were completed pregnancies, 6 (9%) were miscarriages, and 6 (9%) were terminated. Of the 40 women, 18 (45%) had a pulmonary autograft, 13 (32%) a homograft, and 9 (23%) a mechanical valve. The mean age at the first pregnancy was 30.0 Â± 5.7 years. No maternal mortality but 1 fetal death (1.8%) and 1 neonatal death (1.8%) occurred. Maternal cardiac complications developed in 13% and obstetric complications in 38% of the completed pregnancies. Heart failure (9%), arrhythmias (7%), hypertension-related disorders (7%), preterm delivery (24%), and small-for-gestational-age infants (15%) were most often encountered. Mechanical valve recipients had the greatest incidence of both cardiac and obstetric complications. In conclusion, pregnancy-associated complications after aortic valve replacement were common, and human tissue valves should be considered in the discussion for the optimal aortic valve substitute in a young woman. However, careful obstetric monitoring is mandatory.
