The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of administered intravenously niferidil in doses 10, 20 and 30 mkg per kg in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) and flutter (AFL) for pharmacological cardioversion. The study included 30 patients (22 male) with persistent AF (n = 28) and AFL (n = 2) without structural heart diseases with median arrhythmia duration 6.1 +/- 4.8 months (2 weeks to 24 months). Niferidil was administered as 3 bolus injections (10 mkg per kg each) performed with the interval of 15 minutes. Antiarrhythmic efficacy of niferidil in dose of 10 mkg per kg was 60%, in dose of 20 mkg per kg it was 70%, and in dose of 30 mkg per kg reached 90% prespectively. The part of the patients, in whom QTc prolongation exceeded potentionally dangerous value of 500 mc, was 22.2% (6 of 27). None of the patients developed proarrhythmic side effect as torsade de pointes.
