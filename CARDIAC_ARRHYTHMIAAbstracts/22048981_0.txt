 AIMS: To investigate the atrial electromechanical delay (EMD) duration that is a non-invasive predictor of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with Behcet's disease (BD). METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-eight Behcet's patients (24 females, 14 males; mean age: 43.6 ± 10.3 years) who were being followed in the dermatology or internal medicine department and 29 demographically matched controls (13 females, 16 males; mean: age 42.6 ± 11.1 years) were included in the study. The inclusion criteria were recurrent oral ulcerations and two of the following features: recurrent genital ulceration, eye lesions, skin lesions or positive pathergy skin test for Behcet's group. Using tissue Doppler imaging, atrial electromechanical coupling [time interval from the onset of P wave on surface electrocardiogram to the beginning of A wave interval with tissue Doppler echocardiography (PA)] were measured from the lateral mitral annulus (PA lateral), septal mitral annulus (PA septum), and right ventricular tricuspid annulus (PA tricuspid). The mean disease duration was 10.5 ± 7.7 years. The inter-atrial and intra-atrial EMD were significantly higher in the Behcet group than those in the controls (19.8 ± 8.2 vs. 13.1 ± 4.4 ms, P = 0.001; 11.5 ± 7.4 vs. 6.9 ± 3.7 ms, P = 0.02; respectively). The left atrial EMD was similar in both of the groups. However, the P(max) and PWD values were significantly higher in the BD group compared with those in the controls (120.5 ± 10.1 vs. 112.1 ± 5.9 ms, P < 0.0001; 44.9 ± 10.7 vs. 28.4 ± 5.9 ms, P < 0.0001; respectively). CONCLUSION: Atrial electromechanical conduction times were increased in the BD patients compared with those in the controls. The tendency of BD patients to go into AF can be easily and non-invasively detected using tissue Doppler echocardiography. These findings may be indicators for subclinical cardiac involvement.
