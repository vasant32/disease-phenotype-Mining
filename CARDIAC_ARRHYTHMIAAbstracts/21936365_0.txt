Singularity is a basic feature of biological signals. Based on the variations of wavelet transform modulus maxima in multi-scales, we studied the basic theorem for analyzing the singularity and proposed an algorithm for calculating lipschitz exponent. Then we applied the algorithm to calculate the singularity of R-wave in ECG. Our study found that the level of singularity of R-waves in ECG between the 10 arrhythm patients randomly chosen and the healthy persons was significantly different, with the level of singularity of R-wave of normal persons remarkably higher than that of arrhythmia patients.
