 AIMS: Verapamil-sensitive idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia (ILVT) combined with a left accessory pathway (AP) is a relatively rare condition. This study examines the characteristics of patients with this condition and the effect of radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA). METHODS AND RESULTS: Catheter ablation was performed on 140 ILVT patients at a single centre from January 2004 to December 2009. A concealed left AP was found in seven patients (5%), all of whom were male, with an average age of 21 ± 9 years. Sustained ILVT and orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) were induced in all seven patients. Retrograde activation through a bystander AP occurred concomitantly with ILVT, with an average tachycardia length of 346 ± 29 ms (range 310-400 ms). The location of the APs in four patients was left posterior, two of which showed a slow and decremental property, while in three it was left lateral. Ablation via a retrograde transaortic approach was performed in the seven patients. The left AP was ablated first in six patients, but ILVT was no longer induced in one and became non-sustained in another. In the seventh patient, ILVT was ablated first and this proved successful. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with IVLT, 5% had a concomitant left AP, most of who were young men. The location of the left AP was mainly posterior and lateral, with 30% showing a slow and decremental property. Idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia and AP should be ablated simultaneously.
