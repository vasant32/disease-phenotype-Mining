Cardiac complications have been rarely reported associated with the ketogenic diet. Prolonged QT interval in the electrocardiogram and torsades de pointes arrhythmias have been described in a few cases. The effect of the ketogenic diet on QT interval has not been systematically evaluated. We obtained serial electrocardiograms in our patients on the ketogenic diet to look for changes in the mean QT interval. Twenty seven children aged 6 months to 5 years with refractory epilepsy were enrolled. Classic ketogenic diet was introduced using a non-fasting gradual initiation protocol. All patients were supplemented with oral calcium and selenium. Electrocardiograms were obtained at baseline and after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months on the ketogenic diet. There was no statistically significant change in the corrected QT interval over time. There were no ST segment changes or dysrhythmias in any of the electrocardiograms.
