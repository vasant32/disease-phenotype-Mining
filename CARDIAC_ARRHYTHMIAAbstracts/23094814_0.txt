Cardiac tumors are rare. They can be divided into primary and secondary. Primary tumors are benign or malignant. The diagnostics is based on imaging techniques. Therapy is surgical on the first place, followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy in case of malignant tumors. Prognosis of benign tumors is favourable. We present a case report of a patient dying suddenly after hospital admission on for malignant ventricular arrhythmia. Gradually we revealed a nehodgkin lymphoma infiltration of the heart as the structural fundamental of this arrhythmia.
