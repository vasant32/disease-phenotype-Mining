Fatal motor vehicle accidents (fMVAs) as well as accidents involving pedestrians or bicyclists in Uusimaa county in 2008 were reviewed. Of the fMVAs, acute disease attacks while driving caused 26.5% (9/34) of the drivers' deaths. This equalled with the number of alcohol-related fatal accidents. Heart attack was the main cause (7/9 disease attacks). Three bicyclists (3/14; 21%) died for health reasons; two for ventricular fibrillation and one for alcohol intoxication probably combined with cardiac arrhythmia. Diseases served also as background causes for fMVAs. Education of health care personnel on medical conditions and driving should be improved.
