Andersen Tawil syndrome is a rare type of channelopathy characterized by the presence of periodic paralysis, cardiac arrhythmia (prolonged QT interval or ventricular arrhythmia) and distinct dysmorphic abnormalities. It is a type of potassium channelopathy that occurs sporadically or by autosomal dominant inheritance. We report a 14 year old boy with Andersen-Tawil syndrome.
