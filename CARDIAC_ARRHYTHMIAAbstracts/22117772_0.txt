Preventive action of new antioxidant SkQ1 has been studied in rats on model of cardiac arrhythmia caused by epinephrine. The SkQ1 substance was given in dosages from 0.02 up to 20 moles/kg per os 2 weeks prior to experiment. Intravenous bolus introduction of epinephrine (10 or 6 mkg/kg in different experimental series) caused an immediate rise of arterial pressure in average by 19% and decrease in heart rate in average by 44%. The degree of changes of these parameters was approximately identical in all groups. Arrhythmia in the form of ventricular extrasystolia arose in the first 5 min. The total number of extrasystoles, and index of arrhythmia intensity have been 2-3 times lower in rats receiding SkQ1 in doses of 0.5, 2 and 20 moles/kg. It was combined with increased survival rate of animals. Smaller dosages of SkQ1 (0.02-0.1 moles/kg) were ineffective. Results have shown that administration of mitochondrial antioxidant SkQ1 raises stability of the myocardium to arrhythmogenic action of epinephrine.
