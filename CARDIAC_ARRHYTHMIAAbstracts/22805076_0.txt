Cardiac rhabdomyoma is a benign tumor of the heart in childhood and can be associated with life-threatening arrhythmia. In this report, we present the case of a 2-year-old male with right ventricular rhabdomyoma, who was admitted with syncope that was associated with episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia. The patient underwent combined surgical resection and radiofrequency ablation of the tumor. There was no recurrence of ventricular tachycardia after surgery.
