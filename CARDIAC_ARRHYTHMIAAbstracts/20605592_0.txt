 BACKGROUND: Pulmonary artery (PA)-left atrial (LA) shunt models in piglets have been described, but technical details critical to limit morbidity/mortality and promote study of chronic cyanosis are lacking. Accordingly, we describe our experience with an optimized technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 25 6- to 8-wk-old Yorkshire piglets, a beveled, 8 mm, polytetrafluoroethylene tube graft was anastomosed to the PA and LA. Systemic pressure was maintained at >60 mmHg. Saturation targets were met by adjusting a Teflon band on the graft and distal PA. The target oxygen saturation (SO(2)) was 85% on a 50% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)). If the SO(2) was <75% on a 50% FiO(2), the graft was constricted to achieve a SO(2) â‰¥ 90% on a 100% FiO(2) and 75%-80% on a 21% FiO(2). Complications affecting mortality were neutralized with a stepwise strategy to minimize risk. RESULTS: Thrombosis, blood loss, and arrhythmia were determinants of survival. Protocol optimization over time increased survival while assuring chronic cyanosis. Survival approached 90%, with a SO(2) of 80% to 90%, 3 to 5 wk postoperatively. Complications included bleeding, excessive hypoxemia, uncontrolled shunt flow, arrhythmias, and thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Refinement of surgical technique, shunt adjustment via graft banding, and thrombotic and arrhythmia prophylaxis are the keys to success with this model.
