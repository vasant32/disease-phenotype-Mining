 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Atrial fibrillation induces ischaemic microcirculatory flow abnormalities in the ventricle, contributing to the risk for acute coronary syndromes. We evaluated the effect of dronedarone on ventricular perfusion during rapid atrial pacing (RAP). EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Coronary and fractional flow reserve (CFR/FFR) were measured in the left anterior descending artery in 29 pigs. Six received RAP, six received RAP with dronedarone (RAP/D), seven received dronedarone alone, four received RAP with amiodarone (RAP/A), and six received neither (sham). In ventricular tissue, oxidative stress/ischaemia-related gene and protein expression was evaluated by RT-PCR and Western blotting; Isoprostanes were measured by GC-MS procedures. KEY RESULTS: CFR was decreased in the RAP group, compared with other groups. FFR was not different between groups. Effective refractory period was reduced in RAP compared with RAP/D. RAP-activated PKC phosphorylation tended to be decreased by dronedarone (P= 0.055) RAP induced NOX-1 and NOX-2 protein and the mRNA for hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). Dronedarone reduced the pacing-dependent increase in the expression of NOX-2 protein and of HIF-1α mRNA. The oxidative stress marker, F(2)-isoprostane, was increased by RAP and this increase was attenuated by dronedarone. Other oxidative stress/ischaemia-related genes were induced by RAP compared with sham and were decreased by dronedarone treatment. In HL1 cells, dronedarone significantly inhibited the increased phosphorylation of PKCα after oxidative stress, with an almost significant effect (P= 0.059) on that after RAP. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Dronedarone abolished RAP-induced ventricular microcirculatory abnormalities by decreasing oxidative stress/ischaemia-related gene and protein expression in the ventricle.
