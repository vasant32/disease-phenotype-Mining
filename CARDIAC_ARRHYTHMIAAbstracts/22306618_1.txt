 BACKGROUND: Left ventricular outflow tract tachycardia/premature depolarizations (VT/VPDs) arising near the anterior epicardial veins may be difficult to eliminate through the coronary venous system. OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of an alternative successful ablation strategy targeting the left sinus of Valsalva (LSV) and/or the adjacent left ventricular (LV) endocardium. METHODS: Of 276 patients undergoing mapping/ablation for outflow tract VT/VPDs, 16 consecutive patients (8 men; mean age 52 ± 17 years) had an ablation attempt from the LSV and/or the adjacent LV endocardium for VT/VPDs mapped marginally closer to the distal great cardiac vein (GCV) or anterior interventricular vein (AIV). RESULTS: Successful ablation was achieved in 9 of the 16 patients (56%) targeting the LSV (5 patients), adjacent LV endocardium (2 patients), or both (2 patients). The R-wave amplitude ratio in lead III/II and the Q-wave amplitude ratio in aVL/aVR were smaller in the successful group (1.05 ± 0.13 vs 1.34 ± 0.37 and 1.24 ± 0.42 vs 2.15 ± 1.05, respectively; P = .043 for both). The anatomical distance from the earliest GCV/AIV site to the closest point in the LSV region was shorter for the successful group (11.0 ± 6.5 mm vs 20.4 ± 12.1 mm; P = .048). A Q-wave ratio of <1.45 in aVL/aVR and an anatomical distance of <13.5 mm had sensitivity and specificity of 89%, 75% and 78%, 64%, respectively, for the identification of successful ablation. CONCLUSIONS: VT/VPDs originating near the GCV/AIV can be ablated from the LSV/adjacent LV endocardium. A Q-wave ratio of <1.45 in aVL/aVR and a close anatomical distance of <13.5 mm help identify appropriate candidates.
