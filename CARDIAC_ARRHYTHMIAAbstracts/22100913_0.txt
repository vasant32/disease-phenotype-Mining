 OBJECTIVE: To describe the trend in atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment strategies in newly diagnosed AF patients between 1999 and 2008. METHODS: The study was a retrospective cohort study of commercial health plans claims data. Newly diagnosed adult AF patients with ≥1 claim for an AF-related intervention within 12 months of diagnosis were identified. Based on initial treatment, patients were classified into pharmacotherapy or nonpharmacotherapy groups. Pharmacotherapy group was subcategorized into rate-control or rhythm-control groups. Linear regression to assess linear trend and multinomial logistic regression to evaluate factors associated with treatment choice were conducted. RESULTS: Three thousand ninety-four newly diagnosed AF patients were identified. Eighty percent of these patients were initiated on pharmacotherapy with the majority (84%) receiving rate-control medications only. Relative distribution of the 3 treatment groups remained similar over the study period. However, within the rate-control group, the use of beta blockers increased significantly (P < .001). Treatment with nonpharmacotherapy over rate-control medications was higher in males but lower in patients aged ≥80 (relative risk ratio [RRR]: 1.67, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.27-2.20 and RRR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.30-0.77, respectively). Having stroke and congestive heart failure significantly affected the treatment choice between nonpharmacotherapy and rate-control medications. CONCLUSION: Medication therapy, especially rate-control strategies, remains the preferred initial therapy of choice.
