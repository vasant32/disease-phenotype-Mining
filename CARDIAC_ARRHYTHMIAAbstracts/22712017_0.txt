Since unexpected sudden deaths have been reported with the use of diverse non-cardiac drugs, cardio-safety experts focused their attention on security measures to improve survival rates in heart stoppages due to this prescribed drugs (Inchauspe 2010a). Considering that prolongation of the QTc is a reliable marker of a menacing arrhythmia called torsade de pointes (TdP) - that can progress to ventricular fibrillation, application of Bazett, or Rautaharhu formulas can lead to a proper predictive valuation of a "torsadogenic risk." Case-analysis raises up the proposal that QTc or QTp will allow to identify high risk groups; performs a close pharmaco-vigilance and legally register ECG follow-up, avoiding unnecessary withdrawal of useful drugs from market.
