 BACKGROUND: Na channel blockers are effective in suppressing delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) in isolated Purkinje fibers. However, in isolated mouse ventricular myocytes lacking calsequestrin, only those Na channel blockers that also inhibit type 2 ryanodine receptor channels were effective against spontaneous Ca elevation (SCaE) and DADs. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that combined Na channel and type 2 ryanodine receptor channel blocker ((R)-propafenone) is more effective than a Na channel blocker (lidocaine) in suppressing SCaE and DADs in the intact rabbit ventricles. METHODS: We compared (R)-propafenone (3 μmol/L) with lidocaine (50 μmol/L) on SCaE and DADs by using epicardial optical mapping of intracellular calcium (Ca(i)) and membrane voltage in Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. SCaE and DADs were induced by rapid pacing trains and isoproterenol (0.3 μmol/L) infusion. One arbitrary unit is equivalent to the Ca transient amplitude of paced beats. RESULTS: SCaEs were observed at the cessation of rapid pacing in all hearts at baseline. (R)-Propafenone nearly completely inhibited DADs and SCaE (0.04 arbitrary units [95% confidence interval 0.02-0.06] vs 0.23 arbitrary units [95% confidence interval 0.18-0.28] at baseline; n = 6 hearts; P <.001). Lidocaine also significantly reduced the SCaE but was significantly (P <.05) less effective than (R)-propafenone. Both drugs increased the rise time of action potential upstroke and reduced conduction velocity to a similar extent, suggesting a significant inhibition of I(Na). CONCLUSIONS: Both Na channel blockers significantly reduced tachycardia-induced SCaEs in the rabbit ventricles, but (R)-propafenone was significantly more effective than lidocaine. These data suggest that type 2 ryanodine receptor inhibition potentiates the activity of Na channel blockers against SCaE and DADs in the intact hearts.
