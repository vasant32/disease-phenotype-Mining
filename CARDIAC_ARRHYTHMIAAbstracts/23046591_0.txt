BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether exposure to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was a risk factor for AF, and to discern which patients were at the highest risk for AF due to NSAID use. METHODS: A total of 7280 patients with newly diagnosed AF from 2000 to 2009 were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database. On the same date of enrollment, 10 patients without AF, who were matched for age, sex, and underlying disease for each study patient, were selected to be the control group. The relationship between NSAID exposure before enrollment and AF risk was analyzed. RESULTS: The NSAID use was associated with an increased AF risk, especially for new users (odds ratio [OR]=1.651). Among new users, subgroup analysis revealed that patients with heart failure were at the highest risk for AF (OR=1.920). For patients who were only exposed to selective cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) inhibitors, no significant associations were found between AF and selective COX2 inhibitor use, except for patients with chronic kidney or pulmonary disease (OR=1.656 and 1.707, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: New NSAID use may predispose patients to AF, and the risk is almost doubled in heart failure patients. Use of selective COX2 inhibitors was not significantly related to AF occurrence, except in patients with chronic kidney or pulmonary disease.
