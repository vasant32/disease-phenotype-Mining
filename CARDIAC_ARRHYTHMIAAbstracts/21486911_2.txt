 AIMS: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is associated with reverse left ventricular (LV) remodelling. However, the effects of CRT-induced mechanical remodelling on electrical remodelling, and the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias have not been clearly established. We studied the relationship between mechanical remodelling, electrical remodelling, and the occurrence of appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy 1 year after CRT. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed data from 45 patients who underwent ICD-CRT implantation at our centre. Significant LV reverse remodelling was defined by a minimum 10% decrease in the LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDd) at 1 year of follow-up. Electrocardiographic indices of dispersion of repolarization [QTc, Tpeak-Tend (Tp-e) and their dispersion] were measured immediately and 1 year post-CRT implantation. The occurrence of appropriate ICD therapy was noted for each patient. Patients with (n= 21) and without (n= 24) significant LV reverse remodelling had similar baseline characteristics. At 1 year of follow-up, patients with mechanical reverse LV remodelling exhibited a significant decrease in QTc (505 ± 42 vs. 485 ± 52 ms, P < 0.05) and Tp-e (107 ± 26 vs. 92 ± 22 ms, P < 0.0001). However, patients without mechanical LV reverse remodelling exhibited a significant increase in QT dispersion (29 ± 43 vs. 98 ± 47 ms, P = 0.002) and Tp-e dispersion (22 ± 21 vs. 54 ± 36 ms, P = 0.0001). Finally patients with mechanical LV reverse remodelling experienced a lower rate of ICD therapy (P = 0.0025) after a mean follow-up of 19 months. CONCLUSION: Reverse LV mechanical remodelling is associated with reversal of electrical remodelling and a lower rate of appropriate ICD therapy following CRT.
