 BACKGROUND: Magnet field imaging (MFI) is a noninvasive method to determine cardiac electromagnetic activity. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aims to compare the electromagnetic QRS fragmentation index (eQFI) in survivors of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) to healthy individuals. METHODS: Twenty-five consecutive patients with documented sustained VT or VF who underwent a MFI investigation between December 2009 and October 2011 were compared with 25 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals. RESULTS: Patients with documented VT or VF showed a trend to higher eQFI values compared with the control group (p = 0.06). This increase was mainly driven by VT/VF patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMP) which was markedly elevated compared with the healthy controls (1.48 vs. 1.07; p = 0.01). In patients with nonischemic CMP or acute coronary syndrome, eQFI was not different from the healthy group. CONCLUSIONS: Electromagnetic QRS fragmentation is increased in VT/VF patients with ischemic CMP but not in patients with ventricular arrhythmias of other origin. Further investigations in prospective cohorts should evaluate the prognostic value of electromagnetic QRS fragmentation in patients with ischemic heart disease to predict the occurrence of VT/VF and to guide therapy.
