A 62-year-old man with uncorrected cyanotic congenital heart disease involving double inlet left ventricle with visceral and atrial situs solitus, L-looped ventricles, L-transposed great vessels, and pulmonary stenosis, presented with recurrent atrial tachycardia. Entrainment mapping revealed the arrhythmia mechanism to be an uncommon micro-reentrant cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent circuit (intra-isthmus reentry), which was amenable to radiofrequency ablation. This uncommon right atrial arrhythmia is yet to be reported in patients with complex congenital heart disease and was amenable to radiofrequency ablation.
