 BACKGROUND: Increased heart rate is a normal physiological adaptation occurring during pregnancy. Some women have severe tachycardia requiring medical attention. Aim of this study is to determine the number of women with benign symptomatic palpitations who receive treatment. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of all women who were referred to our obstetric-medicine clinic for evaluation of palpitation from January 2009 to December 2009 in one major maternity hospital in Kuwait. RESULTS: A total number of 27 women were identified. Of these, only 7 (25.9%) were given treatment for palpitation. Two were started on digoxin, 3 given propranolol, 1 woman on both propranolol and digoxin and 1 was started on verapamil. Eighteen women had normal deliveries with healthy babies. CONCLUSION: Palpitation is a common symptom during pregnancy. However, only a small number of patients receive treatment despite safety of drugs that are used to control tachycardia.
