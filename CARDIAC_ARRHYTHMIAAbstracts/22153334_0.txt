 BACKGROUND: Compliance to long-term ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring is important for diagnosis in patients with cardiac arrhythmia. This requires a system with a minimal impact on daily activities. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate if a lightweight integrated adhesive monitor for long-term use without unacceptable adverse effects is feasible. METHODS: The participants wore either a prototype lightweight monitor or a control system for a total of up to 30 days, changing patches once (investigational device) or twice (control) weekly. Comfort, skin irritation, and impact on quality of life were recorded. RESULTS: The new monitor can be worn by most participants for periods of at least 6 days. Skin irritation and comfort rating were comparable, and impact on the quality of life was low compared with the control. Patients considered the device comfortable. CONCLUSION: An integrated adhesive monitor that can be worn on the skin up to 7 days with minimal side effects is feasible.
