Transcatheter closure of ventricular septal defect (VSD) has been widely used worldwide. Despite of high success rate and minimal operative mortality, arrhythmia during and post operation has been frequently observed. However, sustained ventricular tachycardia following deployment of occluder has not been reported. In this present case, we present one rare case of late-onset sustained ventricular tachycardia, which developed 71 hours after deployment of an Amplatzer-type occluder for perimembranous VSD (PmVSD) in a 3 year and 5 month-old boy. The sustained ventricular tachycardia was successfully corrected with the administration of Lidocaine, Amiodarone and Dexamethasone. The reoccurrence of VT was not observed in the most recent follow-up at 6 month. In summary, the current case indicated that sustained ventricular tachycardia could occur following deployment of Amplatzer-type occluder for PmVSD, which could be corrected with antiarrhythmic drugs.
