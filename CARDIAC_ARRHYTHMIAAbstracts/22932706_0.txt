Flecainide is nonselective Na(+) channel blocker which may also inhibit I(Kr), the rapid component of the delayed rectifier. This study was designed to explore if proarrhythmic responses to flecainide noted in cardiac patients may be partly attributed to abnormal changes in repolarization and refractoriness. Monophasic action potential duration (APD) and effective refractory periods (ERP) were assessed at distinct epicardial and endocardial sites along with volume-conducted ECG recordings in isolated perfused guinea-pig heart preparations. Flecainide was found to prolong ventricular repolarization, with effect being greater at the left ventricular compared with the right ventricular epicardium. This change translated to reversal of the normal right ventricular-to-left ventricular transepicardial APD difference determined before drug infusion. An inverse correlation between local epicardial APD and corresponding activation time values seen at baseline was eliminated in flecainide-treated hearts, indicating the activation-to-repolarization uncoupling. Over transmural plane, flecainide produced a greater ERP lengthening at endocardium than epicardium, thus markedly increasing ERP dispersion across ventricular wall. Spontaneous short-lasting episodes of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia were observed in 45% of heart preparations upon flecainide infusion. In conclusion, in nonischemic guinea-pig heart, flecainide-induced proarrhythmia may be partly attributed to abnormal spatial gradients in repolarization and refractoriness and impaired transepicardial activation-to-repolarization coupling.
