Cardiac adverse effects have never been reported with interferon (INF) beta. We report a case of left bundle branch block in a 35-year-old woman treated with INF beta-1a for multiple sclerosis. Five years after INF therapy, she presented loss of consciousness, retrosternal pains, short breath and lowered tolerance of effort. ECG and Holter 24-h ECG monitoring revealed permanent complete left bundle branch block. Nine months after stopping INF, no abnormalities were found at ECG and echocardiogram examination.
