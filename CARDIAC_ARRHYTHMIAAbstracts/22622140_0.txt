Heart failure (HF) is a common cause of pleural effusion. Atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATa) can precipitate HF. ATa precipitating unilateral pleural effusion (PLE) has not been reported. We report a case of ATa in a patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with recurrent unilateral rightsided PLE and resolution of effusion with catheter ablation of the arrhythmia.
