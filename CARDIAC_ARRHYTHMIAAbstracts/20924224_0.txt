 BACKGROUND: The different influences of one of the PRL isoforms (PRL I) on the cardiovascular system have been described in the past. AIM: Our goal was to establish an appropriate iv dose of 2 PRL isoforms (PRL I and PRL II) in intact rats. After establishing this dose, PRL I (0.01 mg/kg) or PRL II (0.001 mg/kg) was administered in bolus 10 min before left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion (7 min) followed by re-perfusion (15 min). We then aimed to study and compare the effects of these isoforms on ischemia- and re-perfusion-induced arrhythmias in the ischemia and re-perfusion-induced arrhythmias model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mortality index, ventricular fibrillation and tachycardia (VF, VT) incidence and duration, systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate and myocardial index of oxygen consumption [pressure rate product (PRP)] were measured and calculated. RESULTS: Both PRL isoforms reduced animal mortality (from 50 to 18.75 and 25%, respectively). PRL II significantly reduced VF incidence (to 25%) as well as VT duration (18.21 Â± 3.09) and these effects were markedly different from PRL I and from the control group (p<0.05). Both PRL reduced PRP in the recovery phase (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We proved that supraphysiological doses of PRL isoforms administered in bolus could protect against sudden cardiac death as well as severe arrhythmias episodes during re-perfusion. Because of PRL's positive influence on the cardiovascular system and as an endogenous, well-tolerated substance, it might be of potential clinical use.
