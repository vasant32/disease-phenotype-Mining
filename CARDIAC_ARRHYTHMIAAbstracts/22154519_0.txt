Hyperthyroidism is a common side effect encountered in patients prescribed long-term amiodarone therapy for cardiac arrhythmias. We previously studied 354 patients prescribed amiodarone in whom the occurrence of hyperthyroidism was associated with major adverse cardiovascular events including heart failure, myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmias, stroke and even death [1]. We now present a case of amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism complicated by isolated right heart failure and pulmonary hypertension that resolved with treatment of hyperthyroidism. Detailed quantitative echocardiography enables improved understanding of the haemodynamic mechanisms underlying the condition.
