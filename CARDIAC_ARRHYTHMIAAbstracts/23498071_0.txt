Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent supraventricular arrhythmia in our environment. The incidence and prevalence of this disease increase with age and with the presence of concomitant cardiovascular disorders; consequently, AF is frequently encountered in the field of internal medicine. Elderly patients have a series of characteristics that lead to a high risk of thromboembolic complications and hemorrhagic events. Internal medicine specialists should be trained in the global management of this disease, in order to correctly evaluate the risk of complications and take unusually difficult decisions. The new oral anticoagulants provide an interesting and promising alternative in the prevention of AF-related stroke, although there are several limitations to consider before prescribing these agents in this group of patients.
