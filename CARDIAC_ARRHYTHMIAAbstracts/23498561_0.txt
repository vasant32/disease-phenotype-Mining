Brain injury after resuscitation is associated with high morbidity and mortality in children. Therapeutic hypothermia has theoretical benefits on brain preservation. It has been shown to be effective in improving neurological outcomes after adult ventricular arrhythmia-induced cardiac arrest and neonatal asphyxia. However, there have only been a few reports about therapeutic hypothermia after pediatric resuscitation. We conducted this retrospective cohort study in a tertiary pediatric intensive care unit between January 2010 and June 2012. All children from 2 months to 18 years of age with resuscitation and a history of at least 3 minutes of chest compressions with survival for 12 hours or more after return of circulation were eligible. Forty-three patients met the eligibility criteria for the study. Forty-two patients (97.6%) were asphyxial in etiology; 29 (67.4%) of them occurred out-of-hospital. Excluding one child with cardiac etiology, the overall survival rate to hospital discharge was 57.1%. Fourteen (33.3%) patients received hypothermia therapy and were cooled to 33Â°C for 72 hours. The survival rate was higher in the therapeutic hypothermia group (11/14, 78.6%) than in the normothermia group (13/28, 46.4%). In conclusion, therapeutic hypothermia was associated with increased survival rate after pediatric resuscitation.
