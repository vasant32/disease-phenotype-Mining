 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Growing evidence suggests that long-term abuse of ketamine does harm the heart and increases the risk of sudden death. The present study was performed to explore the cardiotoxicity of ketamine and the protective effects of metoprolol. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Rats and rabbits were divided into control, ketamine, metoprolol alone and ketamine plus metoprolol groups. Ketamine (40 mg·kg(-1) ·day(-1), i.p.) and metoprolol (20 mg·kg(-1) ·day(-1), p.o.) were administered continuously for 12 weeks in rats and 8 weeks in rabbits. Cardiac function, electrophysiological disturbances, cardiac collagen, cardiomyocte apoptosis and the remodelling-related proteins were evaluated. KEY RESULTS: Rabbits treated with ketamine showed decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, slowed ventricular conduction velocity and increased susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmia. Metoprolol prevented these pathophysiological alterations. In ketamine-treated rats, cardiac collagen volume fraction and apoptotic cell number were higher than those of control animals; these effects were prevented by co-administration of metoprolol. Consistently, the expressions of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases-1, apoptosis-inducing factor and NF-κB-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells were all increased after ketamine treatment and sharply reduced after metoprolol administration. Moreover, ketamine enhanced sympathetic sprouting, manifested as increased growth-associated protein 43 and tyrosine TH expression. These effects of ketamine were prevented by metoprolol. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Chronic treatment with ketamine caused significant ventricular myocardial apoptosis, fibrosis and sympathetic sprouting, which altered the electrophysiological properties of the heart and increased its susceptibility to malignant arrhythmia that may lead to sudden cardiac death. Metoprolol prevented the cardiotoxicity of ketamine, indicating a promising new therapeutic strategy.
