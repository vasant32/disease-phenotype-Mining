 OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether increased Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) activity aggravates defective excitation-contraction coupling and proarrhythmic activity in mice expressing R4496C mutated cardiac ryanodine receptors (RyR2). BACKGROUND: RyR2 dysfunction is associated with arrhythmic events in inherited and acquired cardiac disease. METHODS: CaMKIIδc transgenic mice were crossbred with RyR2(R4496C+/-) knock-in mice. RESULTS: Heart weight-to-body weight ratio in CaMKIIδc/RyR2(R4496C) and CaMKIIδc mice was similarly increased approximately 3-fold versus wild-type mice (p < 0.05). Echocardiographic data showed comparable cardiac dilation and impaired contractility in CaMKIIδc/RyR2(R4496C) and CaMKIIδc mice. Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) content in isolated myocytes was decreased to a similar extent in CaMKIIδc/RyR2(R4496C) and CaMKIIδc mice. However, relaxation parameters and Ca(2+) decay at 1 Hz were prolonged significantly in CaMKIIδc mice versus CaMKIIδc/RyR2(R4496C) mice. Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) spark frequency and characteristics indicated increased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) leak in CaMKIIδc/RyR2(R4496C) versus CaMKIIδc myocytes (p < 0.05), most likely because of increased RyR2 phosphorylation. Delayed afterdepolarizations were significantly more frequent with increased amplitudes in CaMKIIδc/RyR2(R4496C) versus CaMKIIδc mice. Increased arrhythmias in vivo (67% vs. 25%; p < 0.05) may explain the increased mortality in CaMKIIδc/RyR2(R4496C) mice, which died prematurely with only 30% alive (vs. 60% for CaMKIIδc, p < 0.05) after 14 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: CaMKIIδc overexpression in RyR2(R4496C+/-) knock-in mice increases the propensity toward triggered arrhythmias, which may impair survival. CaMKII contributes to further destabilization of a mutated RyR2 receptor.
