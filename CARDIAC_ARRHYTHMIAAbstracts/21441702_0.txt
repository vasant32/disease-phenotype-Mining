Hyponatremia is known as a complication of neurosurgical conditions or brain. The prevalence of hyponatremia in acute spinal cord injury has been known to be much higher than in the general medical or surgical patient population. We report here a case of hyponatremia, which occurred 10 days after cervical spinal cord injury. The data on sodium levels were improved under the tapered infusion volume and water intake restriction. Treatment for this case is the same as that for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, which have suggested that reduced extracellular volume is important to improve the hyponatremia after traumatic spinal cord injury. Uncontrolled hyponatremia may lead to lethargy, seizures, coma, cardiac arrhythmia and death. Therefore, the complication of hyponatremia should be paid attention after cervical spinal cord injury. A careful monitoring of sodium levels after the injury is required in the cases of cervical spinal cord injury.
