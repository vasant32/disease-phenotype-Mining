 BACKGROUND: Pregnancy in women with congenital cardiac disease is more frequent due to an increased lifespan and improved health situations. However, the long-term outcomes in these women are not known. METHODS: We analysed 267 consecutive pregnant women with congenital heart defects who were seen at the German Heart Centre Berlin. This retrospective study included analysis of long-term follow-up data after pregnancy and standard maternal cardiac, obstetric and neonatal outcomes. The long-term data (n = 103) were acquired with a self-assessment questionnaire from each patient. The main primary outcomes of the study included functional class, health, work capability and physical activity. RESULTS: The median age of the patients at delivery was 27 years (range 17-43 years). The median follow-up of all patients was 11 years (range 1-49 years). Twenty-four percent exhibited complex cardiac defects. Primary long-term outcomes included good health in 61 % of the patients. Approximately 68 % worked, and 76 % engaged in physical activity. Thirty-three percent of the women who answered the questionnaire demonstrated a decrease in functional class during pregnancy, but more than two-thirds of these patients subsequently improved. Secondary short-term outcomes included a 4 % miscarriage rate and a 4 % induced abortion rate. The maternal cardiac data revealed that 30 % of the patients lost at least one functional class during pregnancy. Onset arrhythmias were observed in 12 % of the patients. The most prevalent neonatal complication was premature birth, which was present in 12 % of the neonates. CONCLUSION: Two-thirds of the patients tolerated pregnancy without cardiovascular complications. Most patients displayed good long-term health, work capability and physical activity outcomes. Further prospective controlled studies are necessary to confirm these results and safely advise pregnant women.
