 BACKGROUND: The hybrid technique combines a mono or bilateral epicardial approach with a percutaneous endocardial ablation in a single-step procedure. We present our early results with this technique employing a monopolar radiofrequency source through a right thoracoscopy in patients with lone atrial fibrillation (LAF). METHODS: Between June 2009 and December 2010 nineteen consecutive patients (mean 60.8 Â± 8.6 years, 84.2% male) underwent right unilateral minimally invasive hybrid procedure for LAF at our Institution. Ten patients (52.6.6%) had long-standing persistent AF while four (21.1%) had persistent and five (26.3%) paroxysmal AF. All patients were followed-up according the Heart Rhythm Society/European Heart Rhythm Association/European Cardiac Arrhythmia Society (HRS/EHRA/ECA) and Society of Thoracic Surgeon (STS) guidelines. RESULTS: There were neither early nor late deaths. It was possible to complete all the procedures as planned without any conversion to cardiopulmonary bypass. No patient died during the follow up. At one year, 7/19 (36.8%) patients were in sinus rhythm with no episode of AF and off antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD). Time-related prevalence of postoperative AF peaked at 44.4% (41.3-47.4) at two weeks, was 30.4% (27.3-34.9) at three months, fell to 14.2% (11.6-18.1) by 6 months and was 13.3% (11.0-17.4) at 12 months Among patients with long-standing persistent (LSP) AF, 20% (2/10) were in Sinus rythm and off AAD. One-year success rates were 50% (2/4) in persistent and 60% (3/5) in paroxysmal AF. At 12 months estimated prevalence of antyarrhythmic drugs and Warfarin use were 26% (22.4-33.1) and 48% (37.2-53.2), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: One year results combining the percutaneous endocardial with the right thoracoscopic epicardial technique were, in our experience, not satisfactory, particularly in patients with LSP and persistent AF. Our findings need to be confirmed by larger studies.
