There is controversy regarding the impact of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in clinical outcomes in elderly patients with pneumonia. Comorbidities such Cardiovascular (CV) disease have been reported to play an important role in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. However, limited data are available regarding the impact of CV disease in elderly COPD patients who required hospitalization for pneumonia.We examined a cohort of subjects with pneumonia and pre-existing COPD. Prior CV disease was defined as history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, unstable angina or stroke. Outcomes examined included 30-day, 90-day, 6-month and 1-year mortality.We included 17,140 elderly COPD patients who were hospitalised for pneumonia. Prior CV disease was present in 10,240 patients (59.7%). Prior CV disease was independently associated with 90-day mortality (21.3% vs. 19.4%; Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.17), 6-month mortality (29.0% vs. 26.1%; HR, 1.28, 95%CI 1.07-1.50) and at 12-month mortality (39.2% vs. 34.5%; HR, 1.33, 95%CI 1.15-1.54) when compared to no prior CV disease. Temporal differential effect between groups increases from 1.0% at 30-days to 4.7% at 1-year.Prior CV disease is associated with increased long-term mortality in elderly COPD patients with pneumonia. Differences in mortality rates increased over time.
