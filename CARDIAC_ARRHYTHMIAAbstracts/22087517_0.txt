Acute internal problems in the respiratory intensive care unit (ICU) and risk factors affecting mortality in the acute treatment applications were investigated. All patients in 20-bed intensive care unit for chest diseases enrolled to this prospective observational cohort study during 2008. Patients were classified as living in group 1 and deaths in group 2. Demographics and acute internal problems (arrhythmias, acute kidney-liver failure, dopamine, doputamin, perlinganit infusion) were recorded. Multiple regression analysis was performed for factors affecting mortality. There were 603 patients during the study period, group 1, n= 503 (83.4%), group 2, n= 100 (16.6%). Both groups were similar in terms of age and gender. Odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI), p value for internal problems of acute risk factors for mortality were found as; septic shock OR: 22.52, CI 8.11-62.57, p< 0.000; need of perlinganit infusion OR: 9.28, CI: 1.61-53.37, p< 0.012; the presence of arrhythmia, OR: 7.81, CI: 3.46-17.65, p< 0.000; acute renal failure, OR: 2.88, CI: 1.24-6.65, p< 0.013 and the need for dopamine OR: 2.83, CI: 1.06-7.65, p< 0.037, respectively. Internal problems such as cardiac and renal dysfunction can devolop in respiratory ICU patients with pulmonary diseases and these problems constitude additional risk factors for mortalitiy. While the number of ICU is increasing with new health policies, each internal requirement and personnel equipped to treat the problem quickly must be considered.
