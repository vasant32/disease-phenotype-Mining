Situs inversus totalis (SIT) is a congenital disorder characterized by mirror reversal of the thoracic and abdominal organs. The underlying cardiovascular malpositions complicate transseptal catheterization. In the present report, we present the case of a patient with SIT, where access in the morphologic left atrium was gained with conventional fluoroscopic approach without the use of intracardiac imaging modalities.
