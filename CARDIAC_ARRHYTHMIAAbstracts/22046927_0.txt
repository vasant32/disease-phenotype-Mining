Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia that significantly increases the risk of ischaemic (embolic) stroke. The primary aim of this article is to help healthcare practitioners understand the link between AF and stroke and to assist them in assessing and managing high-risk patients. The association between a cardiac arrhythmia and a disabling cerebral event is not always understood fully. However, all healthcare professionals are in a position to identify patients with AF.
