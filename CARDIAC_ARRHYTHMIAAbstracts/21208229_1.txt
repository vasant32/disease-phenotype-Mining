 BACKGROUND: Point-by-point use of open irrigated tip catheters (OITCs) at 50 W increases atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation cure rates but also increases complications. We determined if constantly moving the OITC (perpetual motion) when using 50 W increases ablation cure rates without increasing complications. METHODS: We evaluated procedural data, complications, and individual procedure cure rates (IPCRs) for AF ablation using closed tip catheters (CTC) versus OITC at 40, 45, and 50 W in 1,122 ablations. We used "perpetual motion" to move the OITC at 50 W every 3-10 seconds. RESULTS: The OITC showed higher IPCR than CTC at 45 W (P = 0.012) and 50 W (P < 0.0005). For the OITC, IPCR increased from 44.6% to 60.7% as power increased from 40 to 50 W (P = 0.008). The OITC appeared superior to the CTC for all types of AF. For paroxysmal AF, increasing OITC power from 40 to 50 W provided no increase in IPCR (70.6% vs 71.2%, P = 0.827). For persistent AF, increasing power from 40 to 50 W increased IPCR from 34.5% to 59.5% (P = 0.001). Complications were similar for the CTC and the OITC at any power. The OITC at 50 W had shorter procedure, left atrial, and fluoroscopy times (P < 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing OITC power from 40 to 50 W increases IPCR with no increase in complications as long as the 50 W setting is done using "perpetual motion." The OITC 50 W power setting results in shorter procedure and fluoroscopy times and should be considered for AF ablations.
