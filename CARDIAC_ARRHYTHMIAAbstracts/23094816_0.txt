Hyperventilation echocardiography is an established diagnostic test in patients with suspected variant angina pectoris. It has got sufficient sensitivity (60-80%) and specificity (85-100%). Positive hyperventilation test is rarely found, which relates to low prevalence of variant angina. The diagnostic yield of the test depends on the population selected for testing: positive result can be expected in patients with a history of typical burning chest pain, ST segment elevation/depression and/or inversions of U wave during the chest pain episode, arrhythmias related to the chest pain, coronary artery stenosis less than 50% of artery diameter, multi-vessel disease, high activity of illness at the time of hyperventilation test. We present a case of 37 years old man with typical angina pectoris at rest and non-Q myocardial infarction, in whom the coronary angiography was negative. Variant angina pectoris was diagnosed by hyperventilation echocardiography. The ECG tracings showing typical ischemic patterns during the hyperventilation test are included.
