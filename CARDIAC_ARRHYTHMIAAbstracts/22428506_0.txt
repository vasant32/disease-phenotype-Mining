We report the case of a perioperative cardiac arrest (ventricular fibrillation) of a patient undergoing elective orthopedic surgery due to moderate hypokalemia (serum potassium 2.8 mmol/l), whereas preoperative levels were normal. He was successfully resuscitated without neurological deficits and underwent postoperative intensive care monitoring. In times of increasing populations of elderly people presenting with considerable co-morbidity, clinicians should be aware of possible rapid changes of electrolyte levels resulting in perioperative cardiac arrhythmia.
