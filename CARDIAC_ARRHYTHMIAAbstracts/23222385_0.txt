The use of autologous hematopoietic SCT (auto-HSCT) has expanded to include older patients. Increasing age is a well-appreciated risk factor for the development of atrial fibrillation and/or atrial flutter (AF/AFL) in the general population. As more elderly patients undergo auto-HSCT, the risk of developing AF/AFL post transplant may also increase. However, few data evaluating other risk factors for the development of AF/AFL following auto-HSCT exist. Therefore, we performed a retrospective study to determine the incidence of AF/AFL following auto-HSCT and to determine the risk factors associated with the development of AF/AFL. Patients who developed AF/AFL were compared with a group of patients who received auto-HSCT within the same time period (April 1999 to May 2005) and were within 5 years of age. Of the 516 patients who underwent auto-HSCT at the University of Nebraska Medical Center 44 (8.5%) developed AF/AFL at a median time of 4 days (range, days 1-9) following auto-HSCT. In multivariate analysis, risk factors for developing AF/AFL were older age, odds ratio and 95% CI of 1.14 (1.07-1.21), elevated serum creatinine level, 2.69 (1.00-7.22), history of previous arrhythmia, 9.33 (3.01-28.99), and history of previous mediastinal irradiation, 11.12 (1.33-92.96).Bone Marrow Transplantation advance online publication, 10 December 2012; doi:10.1038/bmt.2012.253.
