 OBJECTIVE: To analyze the outcomes of lung resection and off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) synchronously for the patients with lung tumor and concurrent coronary heart disease. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with lung tumor and concurrent coronary heart disease underwent combined surgical interventions between January 2003 and December 2011. They included 20 males and 2 females with a mean age of (65 ± 4) years. The TNM stage of lung cancer was predominantly at stages I and II. A majority of them had two and three-vessel disease. The tests of cardiothoracic functions were normal. The biopsy of lung tumor was carried out initially through sternotomy approach. Then OPCAB was performed. Finally lung resection was carried out according to the pathological results of lung tumor. RESULTS: All patients survived. The average number of anastomosed coronary vessels was 2.3. After myocardial revascularization through a sternotomy approach, the procedures included lobectomy and partial lung resections through sternotomy only (n = 11), lobectomy through a lateral thoractomy approach (n = 9) and lobectomy and bypass to left anterior descending (LAD) through left thoracotomy only (n = 2). Neither death nor new MI occurred during the perioperative period. The mean stay in-hospital was (17 ± 7) days and mean ooperative duration (233 ± 41) min. The diagnoses were non-small cell lung cancer (n = 18) and benign tumor (n = 4). The most frequent complications were cardiac arrhythmias, atelectasis and pulmonary infections. All of them were followed up for 10-60 months. Within this period, 4 patients died from cancer recurrence. CONCLUSION: The combined procedure of OPCABG grafting and pulmonary resection is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with lung cancer and concurrent coronary heart disease.
