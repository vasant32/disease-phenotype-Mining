Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia in clinical practice. It is associated with high morbidity and mortality due to its thromboembolic potential, which makes thromboembolic prevention particularly important. Warfarin has been the first-line therapy for this purpose, but it has various limitations and is often contraindicated or underutilized. The fact that thrombi are frequently located in the left atrial appendage in atrial fibrillation led to the development of percutaneous closure for thromboembolic prevention. This article examines the current evidence on percutaneous closure of the left atrial appendage by reviewing the results of the numerous clinical trials on the technique.
