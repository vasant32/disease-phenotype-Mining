 BACKGROUND: Short QT syndrome is one of the underlying disorders associated with ventricular fibrillation. However, the precise prognostic implication of a short QT interval remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and long-term prognosis in patients with a shorter-than-normal QT interval in a large hospital-based population. METHODS: We chose patients with a short Bazett QTc interval from a database consisting of 114,334 patients to determine the clinical characteristics and prognostic value of a short QT interval. RESULTS: A total of 427 patients (mean age 43.4 ± 22.4 years) had a short QT interval with about a 1.2 times higher male predominance (234 men). The QTc interval was significantly longer in female than in male patients (363.8 ± 6.1 ms vs 357.1 ± 5.8 ms, P <.0001). The age-specific prevalence of patients with short QT interval was biphasic, peaking at young and old age. Atrial fibrillation and early repolarization were complicated with short QT interval in 39 (9.1%) and 26 (6.1%) patients, respectively. The prognosis of 327 patients (182 men; mean age, 46.4 ± 27.3 years) with a short QT interval could be assessed (mean follow-up period, 54.0 ± 62.0 months). During the follow-up, 2 patients, 1 of whom had early repolarization, developed life-threatening events, in contrast to 6 patients who died of noncardiac causes and did not have early repolarization. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of a short QT interval showed a slight male preponderance and biphasic age-dependent distribution in both genders. The complication rate of atrial fibrillation was higher in those with a short QT interval than in general populations. The long-term outcome suggested that early repolarization in a short QT interval might be associated with potential risk of lethal arrhythmia.
