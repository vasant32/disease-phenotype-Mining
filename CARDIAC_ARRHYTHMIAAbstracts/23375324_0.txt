 INTRODUCTION: Arrhythmias occur frequently after heart transplantation (HT), but knowledge of their impact on long-term outcomes is limited. This study sought to investigate the characteristics of the arrhythmias among biatrial orthotopic HT patients during long-term follow-up. METHODS: This study included 217 patients who received biatrial orthotopic HT. Patients were classified into 5 groups according to the arrhythmia episodes that occurred >1 month after HT: no arrhythmias (group 1; n = 149); atrial tachyarrhythmias only (group 2; n = 34); ventricular tachyarrhythmias only (group 3; n = 9); bradyarrhythmias only (group 4; n = 7); or double/triple arrhythmias (group 5; n = 18). We analyzed their long-term outcomes respectively. RESULTS: During 83 Â± 51 months of follow-up, all-cause mortality rates were higher in groups 3 (88.9%) and 5 (72.2%) compared with the other groups (groups 1, 2, and 4: 21.5%, 41.2%, and 57.1%, respectively; P < .001). Cardiovascular mortality rates were higher in groups 4 (42.9%) and 5 (61.1%) compared with the other groups (groups 1, 2, and 3: 8.1%, 20.6%, and 0% respectively; P < .001). Noncardiovascular mortality rate was greater in group 3 (88.9%) compared with the other groups (groups 1, 2, 4, and 5: 13.4%, 20.6%, 14.3%, and 11.1%, respectively; P < .001). Sudden death rates were higher in groups 4 (42.9%) and 5 (44.4%) compared with the other groups (groups 1, 2, and 3: 7.4%, 8.8%, and 0%, respectively; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Patients with posttransplantation arrhythmias experienced significantly worse clinical outcomes.
