We report a case of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia coexistent with a coronary sinus (CS) anomaly. During a standard electrophysiological study, the CS could not be cannulated despite several attempts. A persistent left superior vena cava angiogram through the left brachial vein confirmed an unroofed type CS. Successful slow pathway ablation from the right posterior paraseptum lesion was achieved using an anatomical approach.
