 BACKGROUND: Appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy for ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) depends, in part, on the programming of tachycardia zones. OBJECTIVE: We assessed events treated with ICD shocks or antitachycardia pacing (ATP) in the Inhibition of Unnecessary RV Pacing with AV Search Hysteresis in ICDs (INTRINSIC RV) trial. METHODS: ATP and shock episodes from 1530 patients with dual-chamber ICDs were analyzed. RESULTS: For episodes in which electrograms were stored and adjudicated, ATP was delivered for 763 episodes (182 patients), shock-only was delivered for 300 episodes (146 patients), and shock following ATP was delivered for 81 episodes (56 patients). ATP was delivered appropriately for 507 episodes (130 patients), with 93% success, and inappropriately for 256 episodes (89 patients). For ATP episodes, appropriate (VT: 170 ± 28 bpm) and inappropriate (not VT: 165 ± 21 bpm) rates did not differ (P = .16). When the initial therapy was shock, onset rates were higher for appropriate therapy than for inappropriate therapy (224 ± 46 bpm vs 187 ± 31 bpm; P <.001). Inappropriate ATP was more likely to be followed by a shock (odds ratio 2.49; 95% confidence interval 1.56-3.97; P <.001). Fifty-eight percent (225 of 381) of shocked episodes had rates <200 bpm. For episodes between 200 and 250 bpm, 20% (23 of 113) were polymorphic VT or VF, 59% were monomorphic VT, 19% were supraventricular, and <1% was artifact. For episodes >250 bpm, 37% were VF, 28% polymorphic VT, 23% monomorphic VT, 7% supraventricular, and 5% artifact. CONCLUSIONS: In a general ICD population, ATP treated VT effectively or obviated the need for shock. Most ventricular arrhythmias <250 bpm were not VF. Proper zone programming may identify and treat VT without shock.
