The aim of this study was to determine the current clinical practice of UK stroke physicians with regard to the early management of blood pressure (BP) and arrhythmia detection following acute stroke. Postal service evaluation questionnaires were sent to the lead physicians for stroke in UK hospitals. Hospitals were identified by their inclusion in the 2008 Scottish Stroke Care Audit and the 2006 Royal College of Physicians Sentinel Stroke Audit. A total of 259 questionnaires were sent with a 33% response rate. Current practice regarding acute post-stroke BP management varied considerably. Approximately one-third of respondents lowered systolic BP within the first 72 hours of stroke, but the majority (65%) delayed intervening for at least seven days. Most would not intervene until systolic BP exceeded 180 mmHg. Of those who intervene, the most commonly quoted target systolic BP was 160 Â± 5 mmHg. Post-stroke arrhythmia investigation was similarly varied; 12-lead electrocardiogram recording was frequent, with further investigation being more individualized. Of all respondents, 87% expressed interest in participating in future trials of complex interventions for stroke. Current practice of UK stroke physicians regarding acute BP intervention is diverse, reflecting conflicting evidence. There is interest in the stroke community for further research aiming to answer these important clinical questions.
