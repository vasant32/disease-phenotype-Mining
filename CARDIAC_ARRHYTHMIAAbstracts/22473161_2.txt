 PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term risk for validated symptomatic cardiac events (CEs) and associated risk factors in childhood cancer survivors (CCSs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We determined CEs grade 3 or higher: congestive heart failure (CHF), cardiac ischemia, valvular disease, arrhythmia and/or pericarditis (according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE], version 3.0) in a hospital-based cohort of 1,362 5-year CCSs diagnosed between 1966 and 1996. We calculated both marginal and cause-specific cumulative incidence of CEs and cause-specific cumulative incidence of separate events. We analyzed different risk factors in multivariable Cox regression models. RESULTS: Overall, 50 CEs, including 27 cases of CHF, were observed in 42 survivors (at a median attained age of 27.1 years). The 30-year cause-specific cumulative incidence of CEs was significantly increased after treatment with both anthracyclines and cardiac irradiation (12.6%; 95% CI, 4.3% to 20.3%), after anthracyclines (7.3%; 95% CI, 3.8% to 10.7%), and after cardiac irradiation (4.0%; 95% CI, 0.5% to 7.4%) compared with other treatments. In the proportional hazards analyses, anthracycline (dose), cardiac irradiation (dose), combination of these treatments, and congenital heart disease were significantly associated with developing a CE. We demonstrated an exponential relationship between the cumulative anthracycline dose, cardiac irradiation dose, and risk of CE. CONCLUSION: CCSs have a high risk of developing symptomatic CEs at an early age. The most common CE was CHF. Survivors treated with both anthracyclines and radiotherapy have the highest risk; after 30 years, one in eight will develop severe heart disease. The use of potentially cardiotoxic treatments should be reconsidered for high-risk groups, and frequent follow-up for high-risk survivors is needed.
