Heart failure is the final common pathway of various cardiac pathologies and is associated with sudden cardiac death, mostly caused by ventricular arrhythmias. In this paper we briefly review the electrophysiological remodeling and the alterations in intracellular calcium handling, and the resulting arrhythmogenic mechanisms associated with heart failure. Intercellular uncoupling and fibrosis are identified as a major arrhythmogenic factors. Diet and ventricular wall stretch are discussed as modulating factors. Finally, emphasis is placed on the hitherto poorly studied aspects of right ventricular failure. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Heart failure pathogenesis and emerging diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.
