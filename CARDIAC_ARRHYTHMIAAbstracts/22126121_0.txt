Perisinusal atrial tachycardia may represent a challenging situation due to unsustained burst characterizing the arrhythmia, sensitivity to bumping, and potential complications including sinus node ablation. This case describes the use of a noncontact mapping system to map and ablates this arrhythmia. Benefit of this technology is described.
