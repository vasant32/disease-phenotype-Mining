Background: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) has improved prognosis in fatal arrhythmia and the number of ICD implantations has increased. ICD-related psychological problems and impaired quality of life (QOL), however, have been observed. This study examined whether gender differences exist in QOL and psychological disturbances in ICD patients. Methods and Results: Consecutive outpatients (n=179; mean age, 60.5±15.9 years; 81% male) with ICD implantations completed questionnaires consisting of the Short Form-8 (SF-8), Beck Depression Inventory, Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Worries about ICD. One-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) showed women to have impaired QOL on the role physical functioning (F(15,157)=4.57, P<0.05) and bodily pain (F(15,157)=5.26, P<0.05) subscales of the SF-8. More women reported depression (F(15,157)=5.37, P<0.05) and worry about ICD than men (F(15,157)=6.62, P<0.05). Moreover, women also had higher IES-R scores indicating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than men (F(15,157)=5.87, P<0.05). Conclusions: Women reported poorer QOL on 2 subscales: role physical functioning and bodily pain. There was a significant relationship between gender and depression, worry about ICD, and PTSD, but not for anxiety. Female patients need more psychological interventions following ICD implantation.
