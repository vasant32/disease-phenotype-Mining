We report a case of 59-year-old man with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) complicated by ventricular fibrillation (VF). Continuous electrocardiogram monitoring revealed that J-waves appeared immediately before the VF. The present report is the first to describe a J-wave-associated VF as another possible mechanism of sudden cardiac death in patients with SAH.
