A 65-year-old woman presented with mild dysphagia, weight loss and intermittent palpitation. Chest radiograph revealed a large opacity in the right lower lung field. Subsequent CT scan showed a large posterior mediastinal lipoma extending from the level of the aortic arch to the thoracoabdominal junction. After thoracoscopic resection, the patient's dysphagia and palpitation were resolved. After a follow-up of 2 years, the patient has had no evidence of recurrence.
