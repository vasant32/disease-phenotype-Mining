Isolated noncompaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) is a rare genetically determined myocardial disease caused by abnormal fetal development of the myocardium resulting in a thin compacted and a thicker noncompacted layer of the affected left ventricular (LV) wall. The genetic basis of NCCM is heterogenous. Diagnosis can be made using echocardiography or magnetic resonance imaging. The diagnostic criteria for NCCM are still under discussion. Afflicted patients may present with various symptoms caused by arrhythmias, heart failure and cardioembolic events. Severely reduced LV function as well as left bundle branch block and atrial fibrillation were shown to be linked to worse outcomes. Treatment in patients with NCCM should be targeted at individual symptoms and clinical findings. Therapy includes pharmacological treatment, and in individual cases ablation or device therapy, as well as consideration for heart transplantation in selected cases. Aside from regular clinical follow-up of patients with NCCM screening of first degree family members with assessment of medical history, physical examination, ECG recording, and echocardiography are recommended.
