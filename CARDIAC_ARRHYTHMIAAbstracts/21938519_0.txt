 OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), atrial natriuretic peptides (ANP), N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels, and the risk and recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) after pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). METHODS: Plasma ANP, NT-proBNP, and hs-CRP levels were measured before and 3 months after PVI in 33 patients with PAF and 30 control participants. RESULTS: (1) NT-proBNP levels at baseline were significantly elevated in subjects with PAF compared with control subjects (296.8 ± 272.1 vs. 80.8 ± 69.1 pg/ml), but ANP and hs-CRP levels were normal; NT-proBNP levels normalized 3 months after PVI, but ANP and hs-CRP levels did not change significantly; NT-proBNP levels at baseline in the recurrent group were markedly higher than those in the nonrecurrent AF group (572.7 ± 234.2 vs. 176.8 ± 188.7 pg/ml). (2) Cox stepwise multivariate analysis demonstrated that only elevated NT-proBNP level at baseline was an independent predictor of AF recurrence (p < 0.001) after PVI among 13 variables, such as echocardiographic parameters, plasma ANP, NT-proBNP, and hs-CRP levels. A cutoff value of NT-proBNP ≥ 423.2 pg/ml was a significant risk factor for AF recurrence (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Elevated NT-proBNP level at baseline, but not ANP and hs-CRP, is a sensitive biomarker for early predicting AF recurrence in patients with PAF.
