Electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities and cardiac troponin I elevation are seen in addition to the classic clinical symptoms and signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). We aimed to show that, in patients with ST elevation, troponin elevation, and altered consciousness, the reason may be SAH. A 36-year-old man presented to emergency service with ECG abnormalities, high level of cardiac troponin I, and neurologic symptoms. In the patient's initial ECG, there were sinus arrhythmia, bradycardia, T-wave inversions inferiorly, and concave ST elevations in V1 to V4. Three hours later, his ECG showed increased ST-segment elevations with normal heart rate. The patient's troponin I value was 10 mg/L. Ejection fraction was 60%, and there were no wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography. Computed tomographic scan of the brain demonstrated SAH with falx sign and midline cerebellar hematoma (3 Ã— 4 cm in size) in the occipital region. The patient died on the 10th day of follow-up because of severe metabolic acidosis, multiorgan failure, and bradycardia. Cardiac evaluation is recommended in patients with intracranial hemorrhage in many studies. In our opinion, if there are neurologic symptoms or signs in patients diagnosed as acute myocardial infarction with ECG changes and troponin elevation, requesting threshold of brain computed tomography should be low before the thrombolytic therapy.
