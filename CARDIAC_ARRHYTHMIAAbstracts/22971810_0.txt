Background: Oxidative stress due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) is thought to play a considerable role in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury that impairs cardiac function. The present study examined oxidative damage in I/R injury and investigated the correlation between oxidative stress and impaired cardiac function after I/R injury of the isolated rat heart.Methods: Hearts isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats were mounted on a Langendorff apparatus. Hearts arrested using St. Thomas cardioplegic solution and then they were reperfused. The hearts were divided into three groups depending on the frequency (0-2) of I/R. After I/R, left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), positive maximum left ventricular developing pressure (max LV dP/dt) and coronary flow (CF) were measured. Creatine kinase (CK) was measured in the coronary effluent and 8-hydroxy-2'deoxyguanosine (8OHdG), a marker of oxidative DNA damage, was measured. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was measured from frozen myocardial tissue after experiment. Results: We immunohistochemically demonstrated and quantified levels of 8-OHdG after I/R injury of the heart. The frequency of I/R injury and cardiac dysfunction significantly and negatively correlated. The ATP products were similar among the three groups. The incidence of ventricular arrhythmias was not by affected oxidative stress.Conclusion: The frequency of I/R injury had more of an effect on 8-OHdG products and on impaired cardiac function with less myocyte damage than ischemic duration within 30 minutes of ischemia.
