AIMS: Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is frequently used to guide circumferential pulmonary vein ablation (PVA) for treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) as it offers accurate visualization of the left atrial (LA) and pulmonary vein (PV) anatomy. This study aimed to identify if PV anatomy is associated with outcomes following PVA using remote magnetic navigation (RMN).METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed data from 138 consecutive patients and 146 ablation procedures referred for PVA due to drug-refractory symptomatic AF (age 63 ± 11 years; 57% men; 69% paroxysmal AF). The RMN using the stereotaxis system and open-irrigated 3.5 mm ablation catheters was used in all procedures. Prior to PVA, all patients underwent electrocardiogram-gated 64-MDCT for assessment of LA dimensions, PV anatomy, and electro-anatomical image integration during the procedure. Regular PV anatomy was found in 68%, a common left PV ostium was detected in 26%, and variant anatomy of the right PVs was detected in 6%. After a mean follow-up of 337 ± 102 days, 63% of the patients maintained sinus rhythm after the initial ablation, and 83% when including repeat PVA. Although acutely successful PV isolation did not differ between anatomical subgroups (regular 3.5 ± 0.8 vs. variant 3.2 ± 1.3; P = 0.31), AF recurrence was significantly higher in patients with non-regular PV anatomy (P = 0.04, hazard ratio 1.72). Pulmonary vein anatomy did not influence complication rates.CONCLUSION: Pulmonary vein anatomy assessed by MDCT is a good predictor of AF recurrence after PVA using RMN.
