Neuronal modulation of the sinoatrial node (SAN) plays a crucial role in the initiation and maintenance of atrial arrhythmias (AF), although the exact mechanisms remain unclear. We used a computer model of a rabbit right atrium (RA) with a heterogeneous SAN and detailed ionic current descriptions for atrial and SAN myocytes to explore reentry initiation associated with autonomic activity. Heterogeneous acetylcholine (ACh)-dependent ionic responses along with L-type Ca current (I(Ca,L)) upregulation were incorporated in the SAN only. During control, activation was typical with the leading pacemaker site located close to the superior vena cava or the intercaval region. With cholinergic stimulation, activation patterns frequently included caudal shifts of the leading pacemaker site and occasional double breakouts. The model became increasingly arrhythmogenic for the ACh concentration >20 nM and for large I(Ca,L) conductance. Reentries obtained included counterclockwise rotors in the free wall, clockwise reentry circulating between the SAN and free wall, and typical flutter. The SAN was the cause of reentry with a common leading sequence of events: a bradycardic beat with shifting in the caudal direction, followed by a premature beat or unidirectional block within the SAN. Electrotonic loading, and not just overdrive pacing, squelches competing pacemaker sites in the SAN. Cholinergic stimulation concomitant with I(Ca,L) upregulation shifts leading pacemaker site and can lead to reentry. A heterogeneous response to autonomic innervation, a large myocardial load, and an extensive SAN in the intercaval region are required for neurally induced SAN-triggered reentry.
