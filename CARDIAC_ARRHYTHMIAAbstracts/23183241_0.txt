Cardiovascular disease is among the main causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Despite significant advances in medical and interventional therapy, the prognosis of conditions such as ischemic heart disease is still dismal. There is thus a need to investigate new therapeutic tools, one of which is stem cell therapy. Hematopoietic stem cells are the most studied type, and the fact that their biology is relatively well understood has led to their being used in preclinical research and clinical trials. However, the results of some of these studies have been controversial, which has opened the way for studies on other cell types, such as mesenchymal stem cells. These cells have immunomodulatory properties which suggest that they have therapeutic potential in cardiology. In the present article, the authors review the state of the art regarding mesenchymal stem cells, from basic and translational research to their use in clinical trials on ischemic heart disease, heart failure and arrhythmias, and discuss possible future uses.
