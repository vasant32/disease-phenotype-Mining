In patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, 90% of clots are located in the left atrial appendage (LAA). Therefore, LAA exclusion is a means of preventing thrombus formation and subsequent thromboembolic events in these patients. The LAA can be excluded from the systemic circulation via surgical, percutaneous, or thoracoscopic approaches. The surgical aim is complete obliteration of the appendage without a significant increase in either postoperative complications (bleeding, arrhythmias) or recurrence. We discuss the current surgical techniques available for LAA obliteration and review their results. doi: 10.1111/jocs.12055 (J Card Surg 2013;28:199-206).
