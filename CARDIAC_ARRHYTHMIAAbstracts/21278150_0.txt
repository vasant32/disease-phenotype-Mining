In children, intracardiac loops are created to avoid a lead's fracture due to rapid body growth. Selective site pacing needs the insertion of two 4.1 Fr lumenless leads that do not allow direct manoeuvrability and should be extracted when tension on the lead occurs. We describe an easy, safe, and inexpensive technique to reposition the leads and generate new intracardiac loops.
