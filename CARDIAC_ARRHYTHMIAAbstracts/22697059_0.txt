 OBJECTIVE: Right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) reconstruction necessitates frequent reoperation. To understand the early outcomes, we analyzed our results to provide the intra- and postoperative morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that multiple previous sternotomies do not influence the morbidity, mortality, or survival. DESIGN: We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent reoperative RVOT reconstruction at the University of Rochester Medical Center and SUNY Upstate Medical Center from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2009. Patients were divided into three groups based upon the number of previous sternotomies: Group 1 with one, Group 2 with two, and Group 3 with three or more previous sternotomies. RESULTS: 220 patients had reoperative RVOT reconstruction, 103 in Group 1, 71 in Group 2, and 46 in Group 3. There was no difference in the percentage of inadvertent cardiotomy between groups (Group 1: 2%, Group 2: 1%, Group 3: 2%; P =.9) The number of previous sternotomies had no effect upon infection, arrhythmia, or the percentage of patients who received a red blood cell transfusion (Group 1: 56%, Group 2: 49% Group 3: 43%; P =.3). Perioperative mortality for the entire group was 3/220 (1.4%), with no difference between groups. At a mean follow-up of 39 months, there was a survival of 98% for Groups 1 and 3 and 97% for Group 2 (P =.7). CONCLUSION: Reoperative RVOT reconstruction can safely be performed with limited morbidity and mortality. The number of previous sternotomies does not influence the rate of cardiotomy, red blood cell transfusion, or early outcome.
