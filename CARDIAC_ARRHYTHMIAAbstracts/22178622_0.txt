The Brugada type 1 electrocardiographic (ECG) pattern and the early repolarization pattern (ERP) are 2 ECG patterns characterized by the appearance of J waves. Although Brugada type 1 ECG pattern in the context of the Brugada syndrome (BrS) is well known for predisposing to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, it has only recently come to light that ERP, which was previously believed to be benign, may also be a marker for arrhythmogenic potential. ERP and BrS share many remarkable cellular, ionic, and ECG similarities and behave comparably in terms of their response to heart rate, pharmacologic agents, and neuromodulation. The extent to which ERP and BrS may overlap remains unclear. Here, we present an illustrated case of a symptomatic patient whose ECG signature evolved spontaneously from ERP alone to ERP with a concomitant Brugada type 1 ECG pattern over a short number of days. This case lends further strength to the notion that these 2 ECG patterns may be more closely related than had been initially thought.
