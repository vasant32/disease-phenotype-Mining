Wenxin Keli is the first state‑sanctioned traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)-based antiarrhythmic drug. The present study aimed to examine whether long‑term treatment with Wenxin Keli reduces ischemia‑induced ventricular arrhythmias in rats in vivo, and if so, which mechanisms are involved. Male rats were treated with either saline (control group) or Wenxin Keli for 3 weeks and were subjected to myocardial ischemia for 30 min with assessment of the resulting ventricular arrhythmias. The L‑type calcium current (ICa,L) and transient outward potassium current (Ito) were measured by the patch clamp technique in normal rat cardiac ventricular myocytes. During the 30‑min ischemia, Wenxin Keli significantly reduced the incidence of ventricular fibrillation (VF) (P<0.05). The number of ventricular tachycardia (VT)+VF episodes and the severity of arrhythmias were significantly reduced by Wenxin Keli administration compared to the control group (P<0.05). In addition, Wenxin Keli inhibited ICa,L and Ito in a concentration‑dependent manner. These results suggest that long‑term treatment with Wenxin Keli may attenuate ischemia‑induced ventricular arrhythmias in rats and that ICa,L and Ito may be involved in this attenuation.
