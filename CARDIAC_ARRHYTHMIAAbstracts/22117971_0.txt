Microtubules are important components of the cytoskeleton that forms the backbone of myocardial architecture, sustaining its form and size. This study investigated whether stabilizing microtubules with paclitaxel (0.1 or 1 Î¼M) could decrease myocardial ischaemia- reperfusion  injury, and reduce myocardial infarct size and the incidence of ischaemic ventricular arrhythmia. Isolated rat hearts were used, with arrhythmia induced by regional ischaemia and myocardial infarcts induced by ischaemia-reperfusion. In these ex vivo rat models, paclitaxel decreased  myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury, significantly reducing the incidence and severity of ischaemic ventricular arrhythmia and significantly decreasing infarct size.
