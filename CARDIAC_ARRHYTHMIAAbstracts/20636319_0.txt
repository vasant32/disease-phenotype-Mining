Head-up tilt test (HUT) is frequently used for diagnosis of neurocardiogenic syncope. It mimics orthostatic stress resulting in venous pooling, central hypovolemia with compensated left ventricular hypercontraction, and sympathetic stimulation. Although generally considered to be a safe procedure, we hereby present a rare complication of HUT in a 50-year-old woman with isoproterenol infusion inducing coronary spasm that resulted in ventricular tachycardia.
