 PURPOSE: The benefit of terminal blood cardioplegia (TWBCP) is insufficient after prolonged ischemia associated with inevitable oxidant-mediated injury by this modality alone. We tested the effects of TWBCP supplemented with high-dose olprinone, which is a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, a clinically available compound with the potential to reduce oxidant stress and calcium overload. We evaluated the effects with respect to avoiding oxidant-mediated myocardial reperfusion injury and prompt functional recovery after prolonged single-dose crystalloid cardioplegic arrest in a infantile piglet cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) model. METHODS: Fifteen piglets were subjected to 90 min of cardioplegic arrest on CPB, followed by 30 min of reperfusion. In group I, uncontrolled reperfusion was applied without receiving TWBCP; in group II, TWBCP was given; in group III, TWBCP was supplemented with olprinone (3 μg/ml). Myocardial performance was evaluated before and after CPB by a left ventricular (LV) function curve and pressure-volume loop analyses. Biochemical injury was determined by measurements of troponin-T and lipid peroxide (LPO) in coronary sinus blood. RESULTS: Group III showed significant LV performance recovery (group I, 26.5% ± 5.1%; group II, 42.9% ± 10.8%; group III, 81.9% ± 24.5%, P < 0.01 vs. groups I and II), associated with significant reduction of troponin-T and LPO at the reperfusion phase. No piglets in group III needed electrical cardioversion. CONCLUSION: We concluded that TWBCP with olprinone reduces myocardial reperfusion injury by reducing oxidant-mediated lipid peroxidation, and it accelerates prompt and persistent LV functional recovery with suppression of reperfusion arrhythmia.
