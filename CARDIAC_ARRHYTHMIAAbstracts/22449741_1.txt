 BACKGROUND: Riata and Riata ST leads (St Jude Medical, Sylmar, CA) were recalled in 2011. These leads are prone to externalized conductors. However, it is electrical malfunctions that may result in serious adverse events, including death. OBJECTIVE: To assess the deaths of patients with Riata and Riata ST leads that have been reported to the Food and Drug Administration to determine whether they were due to lead malfunction. A similar analysis was performed for Quattro Secure leads (Medtronic, Inc, Minneapolis, MN). METHODS: In February 2012, we searched the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturers and User Facility Device Experience database for deaths associated with Riata, Riata ST, and Quattro Secure leads. A lead-related death was a sudden or unexpected death accompanied by evidence of lead malfunction; an indeterminate death was a death that was nonsudden or evidence of lead malfunction was not provided; a not lead-related death was a death that was nonsudden and/or there was no evidence that the lead contributed to the patient's demise. RESULTS: The Manufacturers and User Facility Device Experience database search found 133 deaths; of these, 22 were caused by Riata or Riata ST lead failure and 5 were caused by Quattro Secure lead failure. Riata and Riata ST lead failure deaths were typically caused by short circuits between high-voltage components. No death was due to externalized conductors. CONCLUSIONS: Riata and Riata ST implantable cardioverter-defibrillator leads are prone to high-voltage failures that have resulted in death. These failures appeared to have been caused by insulation defects that resulted in short circuiting between high-voltage components. Externalized conductors were not a factor in these deaths.
