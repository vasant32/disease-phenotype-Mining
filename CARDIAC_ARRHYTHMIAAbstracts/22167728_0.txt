Non compact of the left ventricular myocardium is a rare congenital cardiomyopathy characterized by the presence of multiple and prominent deep trabeculations in the ventricular wall, that define recesses communicated with the main ventricular chamber. This is a condition with low incidence and prevalence, diagnosed through imaging techniques such as Doppler echocardiogram (DE), multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Clinically, it may be asymptomatic or manifested by cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure or thromboembolism. This is a report on a 33 year old asymptomatic man who suffered a blow on his chest (commotio cordis) during a sports competition that produced a cardiac arrest. The electrocardiogram showed ventricular flutter that required electrical defibrillation. A DE obtained initially, did not show any significant abnormality, but another DE, a MSCT and a RMN obtained after discharge, certified isolated non-compacted myocardium, ruling out coronary artery disease. He received beta blocker and antiplatelet therapy and the placement of an automatic cardioverter defibrillator was considered. The pathophysiology of the association of these two infrequent and potentially lethal conditions is discussed.
