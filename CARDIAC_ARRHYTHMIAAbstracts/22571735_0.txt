 BACKGROUND: Catheter ablations are traditionally performed using fluoroscopic guidance, exposing both patients and medical staff to the risks of radiation. Nonfluoroscopic catheter ablation has been used successfully to treat limited types of arrhythmias in children, but whether this approach has broad application in adults is uncertain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of fluoroless catheter ablation in adults being treated for a range of arrhythmias. METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospective analysis was performed in 2 patient groups (both n = 60): (1) the nonfluoroscopy (NF) group consisting of consecutive adult patients, in which catheter positioning was accomplished exclusively with intracardiac electrograms (IE), electroanatomic mapping (EAM), and intracardiac echocardiography (ICE); and (2) the fluoroscopy (F) group, in which catheter positioning was additionally guided by fluoroscopy. The patients in the F group were selected to match the types of arrhythmias in the NF group. All ablation procedures were performed by one operator. The total procedure time did not differ between groups for any specific type of arrhythmia ablated. Acute procedural success was similar in both groups (NF, 59/60 [98%] and F, 60/60 [100%]). The complications were limited to a groin pseudoaneurysm in the NF group, and pericardial effusion and groin hematoma in the F group. CONCLUSION: Catheter ablations were efficiently and effectively performed in adults with a variety of arrhythmias using only IE, EAM, and ICE for catheter guidance. This nonfluoroscopic technique was feasible, posed no additional safety concerns, and should be readily implementable in most electrophysiology laboratories.
