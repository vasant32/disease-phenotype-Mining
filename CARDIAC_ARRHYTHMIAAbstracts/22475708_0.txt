Postoperative atrial fibrillation is the most frequent dysrhythmia following coronary artery bypass grafting and is associated with complications, additional therapy, and longer hospital stays. Prophylactic amiodarone protocols have been validated as safe and beneficial in the prevention of atrial fibrillation following cardiac surgery. This study evaluates the use of our current treatment protocol, given prophylactically, as feasible and effective in producing similar outcomes in postoperative atrial fibrillation reduction as well as identifies any perioperative risk factors associated with this arrhythmia.
