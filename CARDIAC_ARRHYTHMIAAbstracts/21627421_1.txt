This study examines the maternal and fetal effects of arrhythmias detected by electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring during labour in parturients at term, with no cardiovascular pathology. Pregnant cases were classified into three groups based on determined stages of labour and a standard 12-lead surface electrocardiogram and long-lead 2 rhythm strips were recorded during the labour. Cardiac arrhythmia of any kind was detected in 82.3% of patients in all stages of labour. Sinus tachycardia was the most commonly observed arrhythmia. Arrhythmias in the form of supraventricular tachycardia, T-wave inversion and ventricular extrasystole were also detected. The highest rate of arrhythmia was recorded for the active phase and 2nd phase of labour. Arrhythmias that are detected by ECG during or after the labour in patients with no cardiovascular pathology display a benign nature and do not create any clinical risk for the mother and the baby.
