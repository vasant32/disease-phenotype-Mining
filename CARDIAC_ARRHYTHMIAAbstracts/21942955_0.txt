The aim was to study the effectiveness of prescription medication containing 90% omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for 6 months on ventricular arrhythmias in patients with myocardial infarction less than a year ago. The study involved 56 patients with ventricular extrasystoles, from 500 to 1000 per day. Divided into two groups of patients we divided into I group - 30 people - received in addition to standard drug therapy of omega-3 PUFA 1 g daily, for 6 months; II group - 26 men were given only previously assigned therapies. The average age of patients in group I - 60,7+/-8,6, II group - 61+/-9,7 years (p> 0,05). ECG monitoring was performed at 3 and 6 months. Administration of highly concentration preparation of omega-3 PUFAs for 3 months reduced number of PVCs per day, frequencies of grades 2, 3, 4A, 4B, and high grade PVCs (grades 3 - 5) as a whole. These effects persisted after 6 months of treatment.
