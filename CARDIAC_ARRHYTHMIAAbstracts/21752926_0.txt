 OBJECTIVE: To determine how the anti-inflammatory properties of aprotinin impact on postoperative complications in children undergoing the Fontan procedure. METHODS: We included all patients between 14 months and 18 years (n=56) undergoing a Fontan operation at our institution between January 2005 and June 2009. The study group (n=29) included patients from January 2005 through December 2007 all of whom received aprotinin. The control group (n=27) included all patients from January 2008 through June 2009 who did not receive aprotinin. We reviewed all medical records and collected preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative data. Duration and volume of chest tube drainage were the primary outcome measures. RESULTS: Of the 20% of patients who had postoperative arrhythmias, multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated only aprotinin was associated with significantly decreased postoperative arrhythmias (P=0.01). Renal function and fenestration or Fontan thrombosis did not differ significantly; there was no statistically significant difference in volume or duration of chest tube drainage. Median duration of chest tube drainage was 7 days in the aprotinin group and 8 days for patients who did not receive aprotinin (P=0.36). CONCLUSION: The anti-inflammatory properties of aprotinin may be protective against postoperative arrhythmias. Aprotinin does not confer increased risks of prolonged chest tube drainage, renal dysfunction or thrombosis in patients undergoing the Fontan procedure.
