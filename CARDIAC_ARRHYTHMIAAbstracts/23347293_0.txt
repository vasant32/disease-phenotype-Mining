 INTRODUCTION: Cocaine abuse is associated with a number of medical complications, most notably arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and cerebral hemorrhages. The injection of cocaine in the penis has been predominantly recorded into the corpus cavernosae and is associated with priapism. AIM: Here we describe the injection of subcutaneous cocaine within the penile shaft skin producing ischemic necrosis and Fournier's gangrene. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We sought to highlight the effects of cocaine use within the penis and emphasize the different effects that may ensue. METHODS: We reviewed a recent clinical case and conducted a literature review on the use of cocaine within the penis. RESULTS: The use of cocaine has been reported previously within the literature and is mainly limited to case reports. Cocaine use within the corpora and the subcutaneous tissues produces significantly different consequences ranging from priapism to Fournier's gangrene. CONCLUSIONS: The case illustrates the growing use of cocaine and other illicit drugs and emphasizes the importance of this issue to all clinicians.
