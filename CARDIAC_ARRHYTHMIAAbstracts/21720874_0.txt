I would like to describe the initial extreme physical and psychological effects of my posttraumatic stress disorder that appeared after multiple shocks from an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, my surprise about my physical awareness, which I and apparently also the physicians could not understand, the feeling of helplessness, the lack of knowledge, the ignorance, and the unfairness of some of the physicians concerning my psychological illness, feelings of being stamped as a psychopath, not being believed, and being let down, my improvements during the course of the last 6 years, my current condition, and my appeal to physicians that better care be offered to patients with a similar illness.
