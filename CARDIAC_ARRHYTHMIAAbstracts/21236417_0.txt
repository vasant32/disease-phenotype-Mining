Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is a life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia. A high impulse current is required in this stage to save lives. In this paper, an empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based algorithm is presented to separate VF from other arrhythmias. The characteristics of the VF signal has high degree of similarity with the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) of the EMD decomposition in comparison to other ECG pathologies. This high correlation between the VF signal and its certain IMFs is exploited to separate VF from other cardiac pathologies. Reliable databases are used to verify effectiveness of our algorithm and the results demonstrate superiority of our proposed technique compared to other well-known techniques of VF discrimination.
