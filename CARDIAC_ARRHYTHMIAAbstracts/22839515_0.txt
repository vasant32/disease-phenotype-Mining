Cryoballon ablation (CBA) for pulmonary vein (PV) isolation is a new method for catheter-based treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The purpose of our work is to describe the CBA technique and to report its short-term results. Methods. CBA was performed in 12 patients (8 men; age 53.1+/-5.7 years) with highly symptomatic drug-refractory AF. Paroxysmal AF was present in 11 and persistent AF - in 1 patient. CBA procedure was carried out under general anesthesia with intubation in 6 and under light sedation in 6 patients. After transseptal access and direct PV angiography, 28 mm-cryoballoon was introduced into the left atrium, and more or equal 2 cryoapplications were delivered to each PV, once good PV occlusion was obtained. PV isolation was verified utilizing a circular mapping catheter. Arrhythmia recurrences were monitored every 3 months after ablation using 24-hour Holter, and additional ECG registrations. Holter monitoring was also performed in a case of symptoms. Results. Complete electrical PV isolation was achieved by only cryoballoon ablation in 11 patients, and additional cryocatheter touch-up ablation was required in left PVs in 1 patient. Total procedure time was 203.1+/-34.2 min, fluoroscopy time - 50.5+/-14.0 min. There were no complications. During a mean follow-up period of 136.8+/-59.8 days 9 (75%) patients were free from arrhythmia recurrence after a single procedure. Redo ablation was required in 1 patient, in whom electrical reconnection to all PVs was documented. Conclusion. CBA is a novel promising technique for treatment of patients with AF, and now is available in Russian Federation. The method standardizes and facilitates interventional AF treatment with acute isolation of 96% PVs. The short-term follow-up shows freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmias in 75% of patients.
