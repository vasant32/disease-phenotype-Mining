 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Drug-refractory ventricular tachycardia in the setting of structural heart disease results in frequent implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapies and an increased risk of heart failure. Management requires catheter ablation procedures for effective suppression of the arrhythmia. RECENT FINDINGS: Imaging and electroanatomic mapping technologies provide new insights into the myocardial structural abnormalities responsible for ventricular tachycardia. Integration of imaging data with three-dimensional mapping systems coupled with improved targeting of abnormal electrical signals may improve the ablation outcomes. New ablation tools show promise for the effective ablation of previously unreachable myocardial ventricular tachycardia circuits. SUMMARY: Catheter ablation procedures have evolved over the last 2 decades. Improved technology may contribute to more widespread utilization of catheter ablation in the future.
