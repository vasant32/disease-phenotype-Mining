Some new guidelines have been published by European (2010) and American (2011) Societies of Cardiology regarding to the management of atrial fibrillation, the most frequent arrhythmia affecting from 1 to 2% of the global population. In this article we summarize and analyse the new aspects of these guidelines in which the different types of atrial fibrillation are redefined, as well as new criterias for the indication of oral anticoagulation and bleeding risk. New antiarrhythmic and anticoagulant molecules also appear in these guidelines, and there is growing evidence for the use of catheter ablation.
