Reliable detection of arrhythmias based on digital processing of Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is vital in providing suitable and timely treatment to a cardiac patient. Due to corruption of ECG signals with multiple frequency noise and presence of multiple arrhythmic events in a cardiac rhythm, computerized interpretation of abnormal ECG rhythms is a challenging task. This paper focuses a Fuzzy C- Mean (FCM) clustered Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and Multi Layered Feed Forward Network (MLFFN) for the discrimination of eight types of ECG beats. Parameters such as fourth order Auto Regressive (AR) coefficients along with Spectral Entropy (SE) are extracted from each ECG beat and feature reduction has been carried out using FCM clustering. The cluster centers form the input of neural network classifiers. The extensive analysis of Massachusetts Institute of Technology- Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) arrhythmia database shows that FCM clustered PNNs is superior in cardiac arrhythmia classification than FCM clustered MLFFN with an overall accuracy of 99.05%, 97.14%, respectively.
