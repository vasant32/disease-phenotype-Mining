Arrhythmogenic role of proinflammatory cytokines is still unclear despite of wide discussion on inflammatory arrhythmogenic mechanisms. The main goal of study was to compare levels of tumor necrosis factor a, interleukin 6 and interleukin 4 in hypertensive patients with and without ventricular rhythm disturbances. The study included 100 cases, 50 of those had ventricular arrhythmias. Levels of tumor necrosis factor a, interleukin 6 and interleukin 4 were studied. Possible connections of above mentioned biomarkers with ventricular arrhythmias, blood pressure, echocardiography left ventricle data were evaluated. Higher level of biomarkers was associated with presence of ventricular arrhythmias; higher rate of ventricular extrasystoles was accompanied with insignificantly lower biomarker level.
