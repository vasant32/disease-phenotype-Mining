 BACKGROUND: Information on comparative outcome between radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA) and antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) >1 year after randomization is important for clinical decision-making. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 198 patients (age, 56 Â± 10 years) with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were randomly assigned to RFA (99 patients) or to AADs (99 patients). We evaluated efficacy of RFA or AADs in a comparable 48-month follow-up period according to intention-to-treat analysis. Cardiac rhythm was assessed with daily transtelephonic transmissions. Quality of life was also analyzed. At 4 years, among the 99 patients first assigned to RFA, the procedure was repeated because of recurrent atrial fibrillation/atrial tachycardia in 27 patients (27.3%). Among the 99 patients randomly assigned to AADs, 87 (87.9%) crossed over to undergo RFA and 4 years after random assignment only 12 (12.1%) were in sinus rhythm with AAD alone without ablation. Despite the high level of crossovers, at 4 years the intention-to-treat analysis showed that 72.7% of patients in the ablation arm and 56.5% of those initially randomly assigned to AADs were free of recurrent atrial fibrillation/atrial tachycardia (P=0.017). During the follow-up, 19.2% of AAD patients progressed to persistent atrial fibrillation before switching to RFA. RFA significantly improved quality of life (P<0.001), whereas before crossing over to RFA, patients receiving AADs showed poorer quality of life. Except for new left atrial tachycardia, there were no serious complications caused by RFA. CONCLUSIONS: With follow-up extended to 4 years after randomly assigned, ablation remains superior to antiarrhythmic drug in these patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
