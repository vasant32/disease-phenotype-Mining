Leptospirosis is a common zoonotic infection worldwide and is recognized as an emerging public health problem. Although commonly thought of as a tropical disease, incidence in temperate climates is increasing, with recent outbreaks in the United States and Germany, among other countries. The disease presents with symptoms ranging from fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting to life-threatening multiorgan failure characterized by acute liver failure, nephritis, pulmonary hemorrhage, meningitis, and cardiac arrhythmia. We describe a case of an otherwise healthy 28-year-old man who had just returned from a 2-month trip to Southeast Asia. He presented to our emergency department twice after his return with the complaint of fever and malaise. Initially, he was treated with symptomatic measures and discharged home with malaria smears and blood cultures pending. On his final presentation before admission, he presented with severe fatigue, myalgia, acute renal failure, and marked thrombocytopenia. After several days, inpatient testing revealed the patient's leptospira antibody titer was markedly positive. Given the nonspecificity of patient symptoms, early diagnosis of leptospirosis can be challenging. Diagnostic uncertainty may lead to delay in recommended intravenous antibiotic treatment. We present a case of severe leptospirosis treated exclusively with supportive measures and intravenous corticosteroids.
