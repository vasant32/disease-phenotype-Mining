The Brugada syndrome has been described as a genetic disorder involving aborted sudden cardiac death in patients with apparently structurally normal hearts. Exercise has been shown to unmask the electrocardiographic (ECG) findings in this disease; however, this is yet to be validated as a useful testing method. This is a case of exercise-induced typical Brugada syndrome ECG changes with no occurrence of arrhythmias during exercise and no ECG evidence prior to testing.
