The association between familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and subclinical cardiac disease remains controversial. The aim of the current study was to evaluate whether FMF patients, who do not respond to colchicine treatment, and thereby endure persistent inflammation, have increased QT dispersion (QTd) values. Twenty-two FMF patients and 22 age- and sex-matched control subjects were included in the study. Repolarization and QT dispersion parameters were computed from 12-lead ECG recording using designated computer software, and results of five beats were subsequently averaged. Both FMF patients and controls had similar comorbidities, similar values of average QT, average corrected QT interval length, average QTd interval, average QT corrected dispersion, QT dispersion ratio, JT dispersion (JTd), and JT corrected dispersion. In conclusion, FMF patients who were unresponsive to colchicine treatment and did not develop amyloidosis had normal QTd and JTd parameters, indicating a non-increased risk for repolarization-associated ventricular arrhythmias.
