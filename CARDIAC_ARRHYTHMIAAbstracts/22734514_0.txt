Ventricular tachycardia arising from the right ventricular outflow tract is one of the common forms of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia. One of the major challenges in mapping and ablation of idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract ventricular tachycardia is noninducibility. Direct stimulation of sympathetic nerves innervating the right ventricular outflow may provide an alternative approach to induce arrhythmia. We report a case of idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia in whom tachycardia was noninducible by aggressive conventional stimulation protocols, which was induced by high-frequency stimulation of proximal pulmonary artery and was successfully ablated.
