 BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing utilisation of interventional electrophysiology in adults and older children with arrhythmias, there are few data reflecting the safety and efficacy of this procedure in the age group under 2 years. AIM: We describe our experience in assessing the efficacy and safety with this group of children. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective review of all infants under 2 years of age who underwent an interventional electrophysiology procedure between 1995 and 2009 to determine indications, procedural details, short- and long-term success, and complication rate. RESULTS: A total of 23 interventional electrophysiology procedures were performed in 17 patients initially under 2 years of age. Of these, three patients had congenital heart disease. The most common indication was arrhythmia resistant to pharmacological agents (59%), with the remaining cases being arrhythmia complicated by cardiovascular instability (41%). There was initial success in 15 patients after the first procedure, with early recurrence in four. Following six repeat procedures, there was long-term success in 15 patients (88%), with three repeat procedures being performed after 2 years of age. There was one non-procedural death related to persisting arrhythmia. There were three minor complications. In one patient, cryotherapy was used successfully. CONCLUSIONS: The interventional electrophysiology procedure is a viable therapeutic option in infants under 2 years with arrhythmia resistant to other conventional medical management.
