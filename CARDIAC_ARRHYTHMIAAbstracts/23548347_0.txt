It is known that not only postinfarction left ventricular (LV) remodeling but also chronic regional myocardial hypoperfusion may cause a compensatory hypertrophy of undamaged areas of the left ventricle. Can chronic LV hypoperfusion lead to the development of mitral regurgitation (MR) in CAD patients without previous myocardial infarction We selected patients with significant coronary stenosis (&gt;75%) of at least one epicardial artery who had no acute or previous myocardial infarction: 1162 patients without MR and 76 patients with moderate and severe MR. Patients with MR more often had higher NYHA functional class (II-IV) (91.7 vs 63.0%, p =0.004) and arrhythmias (60.3 vs 14.6%, p&lt;0.001). They also had significantly higher echocardiographic indices of left atrial dimension (23.5+/-2.9 vs. 20.3+/-2.1 mm/m2). MR was independently associated with NYHA class of congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, and index of the left atrium size. No association between MR and the localization of significant coronary lesions was found.
