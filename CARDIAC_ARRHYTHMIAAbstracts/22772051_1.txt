 AIMS: Cryoballoon ablation has proven very effective in achieving pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). The novel Achieve inner lumen mapping catheter designed to be used in conjunction with the cryoballoon, serves as both a guidewire and a mapping catheter. To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing the latter to verification of electrical isolation with the 'traditional' circular mapping catheter. METHODS AND RESULTS: We assigned 40 consecutive patients matched for age and left atrial diameter suffering of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to cryoballoon PVI using either the circular mapping catheter or the Achieve as a mapping catheter. Duration of procedure as well as fluoroscopy times were significantly lower in the Achieve group than in the circular mapping catheter group (111 ± 14 min vs. 126 ± 13 min, P < 0.005 and 22 ± 5 min vs. 29 ± 4 min, P < 0.0001, respectively). There were no significant differences between both groups in terms of mean degree of occlusion, mean minimal temperatures, and PVI. Pulmonary vein isolation could be documented by real-time recordings in 55% of veins in the Achieve group with mean time to isolation of 65 ± 23 s. CONCLUSION: Cryoballoon ablation in conjunction with the novel Achieve is feasible, safe, and affords PVI in nearly all veins in similar proportions to the approach with the traditional guidewire. Furthermore, if compared to the procedure with the circular mapping catheter, cryoballoon ablation with the Achieve is significantly faster and associated to shorter fluoroscopy times.
