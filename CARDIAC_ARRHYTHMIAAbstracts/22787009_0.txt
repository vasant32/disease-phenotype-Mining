 BACKGROUND: Recent studies have identified the presence of familial clustering of ischemic sudden cardiac death (SCD) as a clinical expression of coronary artery disease. The purpose of this study was to determine whether nonischemic SCD has a similar familial background, which would be evidence of a genetic predisposition. METHODS AND RESULTS: The retrospective case-control study included (1) consecutive victims of nonischemic SCD (n=223), (2) consecutive victims of ischemic SCD (n=596), whose deaths and diagnosis were verified at medicolegal autopsy, and (3) control subjects without heart disease (n=475). In each study group, the family history of SCD among the first-degree relatives was determined and verified from death certificates. The prevalence of SCD in â‰¥1 first-degree relative was significantly higher in victims of ischemic (34.2%) than nonischemic SCD (13.4%; P<0.001) or controls (17.6%; P<0.001). The history of SCD in first-degree relatives did not differ from controls in nonischemic SCD victims (P=0.155). In a subgroup analysis of victims of ischemic SCD, the prevalence of family history of SCD in first-degree relatives did not differ between those with or without a prior infarct scar at autopsy (33.1% versus 29.9%, respectively; P=0.222). CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic SCD has a strong familial background both in cases with and without a prior myocardial infarction. The family history of SCD is not significantly increased in victims of nonischemic SCD, suggesting a larger role of sporadic occurrence than inherited traits as the cause of nonischemic SCD.
