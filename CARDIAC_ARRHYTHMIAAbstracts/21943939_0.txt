Congenital left ventricular aneurysms and diverticula (LVA/Ds) are rare cardiac malformations that can be detected using echocardiography or other imaging techniques. Some of these patients present with ventricular arrhythmias. This study investigated clinical characteristics of patients with congenital LVA/D presenting with arrhythmic manifestations. Over the previous 20 years 250 patients were diagnosed to have congenital LVA/D at our institution. Diagnosis was made using echocardiography after exclusion of coronary artery disease, local cardiac inflammatory processes, traumatic causes, or cardiomyopathies. At initial presentation 32 of the 250 patients (13%, average age 45 years, range 25 to 65, 21 men and 11 women) exhibited arrhythmias. At least 2 LVA/Ds were present in 6 of these patients. LVA/Ds were localized at the posterobasal, apical, anteroseptal, and anterolateral walls in 12, 11, 4, and 5 patients, respectively. The most common complaints at presentation were syncope or presyncope in 18 patients and palpitations in 11 patients. One patient had survived sudden cardiac death. Long-term electrocardiographic recordings showed ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation in 17 patients (53%). Twelve patients underwent electrophysiologic testing. Nine patients had inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmia, whereas induced tachycardia was similar to that during spontaneous arrhythmia in 7 patients. In conclusion, patients with congenital LVA/Ds who present with arrhythmic manifestations commonly have VT. Electrophysiologic testing can reproduce clinical VT in most of these patients.
