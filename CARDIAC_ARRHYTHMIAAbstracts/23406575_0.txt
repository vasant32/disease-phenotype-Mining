Background- We examined the hypothesis that leptin signaling contributes to the atrial fibrosis and atrial fibrillation (AF) evoked by angiotensin II (AngII). Methods and Results- Eight-week-old male CL57/B6 (CNT) and leptin-deficient ob/ob mice (Ob) were subcutaneously infused with AngII (2.0 mg/kg per day). Two weeks later, transesophageal burst pacing and an electrophysiological study using isolated perfused hearts were performed. Left-atrial tissues were collected to determine interstitial fibrosis by Masson trichrome staining, and the expressions of mRNAs related to inflammatory profibrotic signals were assessed. Left-atrial fibroblasts were isolated from adult Sprague-Dawley and Zucker rats. The effects of leptin (100 ng/mL) or AngII (100 nmol/L) treatment were evaluated. In CNT-AngII mice, leptin expression in the left atrium was upregulated (P<0.01). Transesophageal burst pacing induced atrial fibrillation in 88% (7/8) of CNT-AngII mice, but not in Ob-AngII mice (0/8; P<0.01). In isolated perfused hearts, atrial fibrillation was induced only in CNT-AngII mice (4/6; 67%). Interatrial conduction time was prolonged in CNT-AngII mice (P<0.01), but not in Ob-AngII mice. The upregulation of collagen 1, collagen 3, transforming growth factor-β1, α-smooth muscle actin, MCP-1, F4/80, and RANTES mRNA, which was seen in CNT-AngII mice, was attenuated in Ob-AngII mice. In cultured Sprague-Dawley rat atrial fibroblasts, AngII treatment increased leptin expression (P<0.01). Addition of leptin increased transforming growth factor-β1, α-smooth muscle actin, MCP-1, and RANTES expressions in Sprague-Dawley rat atrial fibroblasts, but not in Zucker rat atrial fibroblasts. Conclusions- Our results demonstrate for the first time that leptin signaling is essential for the development of atrial fibrosis and atrial fibrillation evoked by AngII.
