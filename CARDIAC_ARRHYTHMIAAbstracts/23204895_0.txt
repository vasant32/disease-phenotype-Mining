A history of severe allergic reaction to iodine contrast leading to anaphylactic shock presents a dilemma in patients requiring cardiac catheterization. As an alternative, gadolinium has been an interesting and potentially useful agent. However, gadolinium produces poor image quality and has been associated with significant arrhythmias in small case series. Furthermore, there is no consensus about the maximal allowable dose that can be administered to a patient. In the present report, a successful combination of gadolinium contrast with a power injector that produced adequate image quality in a patient with severe allergy to iodine contrast is described. The case was complicated by the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation when damping occurred during injection of contrast into the right coronary artery. This complication has been reported previously with intracoronary gadolinium injection. The report is followed by a brief literature review.
