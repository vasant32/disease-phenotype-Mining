 OBJECTIVE: The clinical data of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients with or without pulmonary hypertension (PH) diagnosed by echocardiography were compared. METHODS: During January 2007 to December 2009, 61 cases of DCM with PH and 51 cases of DCM without PH were admitted in our department. The demographic and clinical data, heart function, echocardiography and serum total bilirubin and creatinine levels of all patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Sex, age, vital signs, combined diseases and arrhythmias as well as the serum creatinine level [(103.5 ± 49.7) µmol/L vs. (90.3 ± 37.3) µmol/L, P > 0.05] were similar between the two groups, while the incidence of NYHA III and IV (95% vs. 65%), the left ventricle end-systolic dimension[(71.0 ± 9.6) mm vs. (65.5 ± 7.2) mm], dimension of the left atrium [(52.8 ± 8.93) mm vs. (43.9 ± 6.3) mm], right ventricular outflow tract [(29.1 ± 5.3) mm vs. (22.1 ± 3.3) mm] incidence of pericardial effusion (29/61 vs. 7/51) and the serum total bilirubin level [(45.3 ± 31.8) µmol/L vs. (19.5 ± 9.08) µmol/L] were significantly higher while ejective fraction was significantly lower in DCM with PH than those in DCM without PH (0.28 ± 0.10 vs. 0.36 ± 0.10, all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: DCM patients with PH is linked with worse clinical features than DCM patients without PH.
