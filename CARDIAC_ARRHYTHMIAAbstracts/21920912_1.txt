 AIMS: While in radiofrequency ablation for atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) a residual jump and a single echo do not seem to substantially modify long-term results, in cryoablation procedures their effects are still under evaluation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if a residual jump associated or not with an isolated echo is correlated with outcome. METHODS AND RESULTS: Inclusion criteria: acute successful slow pathway cryoablation for slow-fast AVNRT. Exclusion criteria: use of a 4 mm tip cryocatheter, no baseline elicitable jump or inducible AVNRT, and unwanted persistent first degree atrioventricular (AV) block at the end of the procedure. Cryoablation (-80°C × 4 min) was applied after successful cryomapping. Atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia inducibility was checked 30 min later on and off isoproterenol. Acute success was defined as AVNRT non-inducibility. Among 332 patients (pts) who had undergone cryoablation from May 2002 to March 2010 in our institutions, 245 of them fulfilled the entry criteria (173 women, mean age 41 ± 16 years, ineffective drugs 1.3 ± 1.1). A 7-Fr 6-mm tip cryocatheter (CryoCath®) was used in all cases. Baseline AV nodal effective refractory period (ERP) was 271 ± 55 ms, post-procedural ERP 331 ± 60 ms (P< 0.001), and the mean of the difference between baseline and post-procedural ERP 63 ± 38 ms. A/V ratio at successful site was 1 ± 0.4. Forty-four pts (18%) had a residual jump at the end of the procedure, and 14 of them had an associated single echo. Global cryoapplication time was 993 ± 797 s. During a follow-up of 40 ± 10 months, 43 pts (17.5%) had recurrences. At 12 months follow-up, actuarial rate of recurrence-free pts was 85% in the group without residual jump (201 pts), 63.3% with residual jump and no echo (30 pts), and 60.6% with residual jump associated with a single echo (P< 0.003 among groups). Univariate predictors of recurrences were persistence of a residual jump (P< 0.001) and total cryoapplication time (P< 0.02). In a multivariate model, only residual jump was independently correlated with recurrences (P< 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing AVNRT cryoablation, slow-pathway suppression is correlated with a better outcome. A single echo is associated with a recurrence risk similar to residual jump without echo. It may be suggested that pursuing a procedural endpoint up to slow pathway complete suppression may improve long-term success.
