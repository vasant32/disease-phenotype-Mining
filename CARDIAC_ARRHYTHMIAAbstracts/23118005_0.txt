 AIMS: The majority of patients with pacemakers are very elderly, many being >85-years old. They often suffer from serious illnesses and have great difficulty in walking. The aim of our study was to compare remote pacemaker monitoring with in-home checks of pacemakers, in terms of applicability, efficacy, and cost in a selected population of debilitated elderly patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We selected 72 subjects (mean age 87 ± 8 years) among elderly debilitated patients with Medtronic pacemakers, compatible with the Carelink(®) remote monitoring system (13 patients with DDD pacemaker; 59 patients with single-lead VDD pacemaker). Remote follow-up was compared with in-home checks performed by nurses in 326 patients in similar clinical conditions. A total of 190 transmissions were received by remote monitoring (mean transmissions per month: 7.0; mean per patient: 2.6; range 1-6) during 27 months of follow-up. In this period, seven pacemakers were replaced owing to battery exhaustion, after a mean of 6.7 years from implantation. The occurrence of atrial or ventricular high-rate episodes was reported in 98 transmissions (53%). Nineteen patients died (annual mortality: 11.7%). On comparing the costs borne by the hospital for in-home checks, both for medical personnel and transportation, the estimated average saving was €32 per year per patient. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the remote follow-up of pacemakers is a reliable, effective, and cost-saving procedure in elderly, debilitated patients. Moreover, remote controls provided an accurate and early diagnosis of arrhythmia occurrence.
