 BACKGROUND: After pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), patients need to be followed to analyze the effect of the treatment. We evaluated the influence of the duration of Holter monitoring on the detection of arrhythmia recurrences after a single PVI at 12 months. METHODS: Consecutive patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) underwent successful PVI with phased radiofrequency and pulmonary vein ablation catheter. Follow-up was performed with electrocardiogram at 3, 6, and 12 months and 7-day Holter at 12 months. Symptomatic patients received additional event recording. The 7-day Holters at 12 months were evaluated for documented left atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrences, and each individual day with AF was categorized. RESULTS: At 12 months after the procedure, 21 of the 96 (22%) patients had AF on their 7-day Holter. In the patients with AF recurrence, there was an increase in sensitivity from 53% of a 1-day Holter up to 88% with 4-day Holter, and 100% of a 7-day Holter. Monitoring with duration of less than 4 days resulted in significantly less detection of patients with AF compared to 7-day Holter. CONCLUSIONS: A 4-day Holter at 12 months has an 88% sensitivity for arrhythmia detection, and appears to provide a sufficient monitoring time. Prolonging the monitoring time to 7 days does not significantly increase the yield.
