 BACKGROUND: Brugada syndrome is a disease known to cause ventricular fibrillation with a structurally normal heart and is linked to SCN5A gene mutation. However, the mechanism by which ventricular fibrillation develops in cases of Brugada-type electrocardiogram without SCN5A mutation has remained unclear. Recently, oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathophysiology of cardiac arrhythmia. We also investigated oxidative stress levels in the myocardia of patients with Brugada-type electrocardiogram. METHODS: Endomyocardial biopsy samples were obtained from 68 patients with Brugada-type electrocardiogram (66 males and two females). We performed histological and immunohistochemical analyses for CD45, CD68, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-modified protein, which is a major lipid peroxidation product. RESULTS: SCN5A mutation was detected in 14 patients. Ventricular fibrillation was documented in three patients with SCN5A mutation and in 11 without SCN5A mutation. In patients with SCN5A mutation, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-modified protein-positive area was not significantly different between the documented ventricular fibrillation (VF) group (VF+ group) and the group without documented VF (VF- group). However, in patients without SCN5A, the area was significantly larger in the VF+ group than that in the VF- group (P<.05). All other parameters (fibrosis area, CD45, and CD68) were not different between the VF+ and VF- group in both SCN5A+ and SCN5A- patients. CONCLUSION: Oxidative stress is elevated in the myocardium of patients with Brugada-type electrocardiogram who have VF episodes and do not have SCN5A gene mutations. Oxidative stress may be associated with the occurrence of VF in patients with Brugada-type electrocardiogram without SCN5A mutation.
