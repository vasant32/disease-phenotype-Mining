Phase-locking behaviors in sinoatrial node (SAN) are closely related to cardiac arrhythmias. An ionic model considering structural heterogeneity of SAN is numerically investigated. The bifurcations between phase-locking zones are interpreted by the map derived from the phase resetting curve. Furthermore, the validity of the circle map in describing phase locking of the actual SAN system is evaluated and explained. We reveal also how the phase-locking behaviors in heterogeneous tissue depend on the location of stimulating site and the coupling strength of the tissue. All these results may be of suggestive uses for understanding and controlling practical SAN dynamics.
