 BACKGROUND: Concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is independently associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Some animal models of LVH display specific alterations of the myocardial interstitium that could increase myocardial vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmias, but these merit evaluation in humans with LVH and SCD. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twelve consecutive patients with isolated LVH and SCD (LVH+SCD) in the absence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, coronary disease, or other cardiac structural abnormality were ascertained in the Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study. Detailed postmortem comparisons were conducted with 18 controls who had isolated LVH and unnatural deaths (Control Group A) and 6 controls who had structurally normal hearts and unnatural deaths (Control Group B). Postmortem left ventricular myocardial sections were obtained for measurement of collagen volume fraction, characterization of gap junctions, and quantification of collagen subtypes. Heart weight normalized to body weight was higher in LVH+SCD cases (6.9±1.2 g/kg) than in Control Group A (5.3±1.4 g/kg) and Control Group B (4.2±0.3 g/kg); P=0.001. Collagen volume fraction was also higher in LVH+SCD cases (3.1±0.4) than in Control Group A (2.3±0.4) and Control Group B (1.6±0.3); P=0.0002. The relative amount of collagen III was significantly higher in LVH+SCD cases (33.0±4.4%) than in Control Group A (20.9±4.3%) and Control Group B (13.4±3.5%); P=0.0001. There was an overall increase in the number of connexin 43-labeled gap junctions with increasing myocyte size. No subject was found to have high-risk hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutations. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the expected increase in myocardial mass and overall collagen content, SCD with isolated LVH was associated with relative abundance of type III collagen, a novel finding that warrants further mechanistic evaluation.
