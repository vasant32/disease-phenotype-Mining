BACKGROUNDS: Aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and the prognostic significance of early repolarization (ER) in infero-lateral leads in patients with Brugada syndrome (BrS) and documented ventricular fibrillation (VF). METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated 10 different twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) recorded on different days for each patient to identify the presence of ER, which was defined as J-point elevation of ≥ 0.1 mV in inferior (II, III, aVf) or lateral leads (I, aVL, V4-6) in 49 individuals (46 males, 46±13 years) with a type 1 ECG of BrS and previous history of VF. The ER was observed persistently (in all ECGs) in 15 patients (31%, P group), intermittently (at least one, but not in all ECGs) in 16 patients (33%, I group), and not observed in 18 patients (37%, N group), yielding an overall ER incidence of 63% (31/49). During follow up period (7.7 years), recurrence of VF was documented in all 15 patients (100%) with P group, and less in 12 patients (75%) with I group and in 8 patients (44%) with N group. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, P group showed a worse prognosis than N group. (p=0.0001) Either persistent or intermittent ER in infero-lateral lead was an independent predictor of fatal arrhythmic events (Hazard Ratio, 4.88; 95% CI, 2.02 to 12.7, p=0.0004, 2.50; 95%CI, 1.03-6.43, p=0.043, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ER in infero-lateral leads was high, and especially persistent form of ER was associated with a worse outcome in BrS patients with documented VF.
