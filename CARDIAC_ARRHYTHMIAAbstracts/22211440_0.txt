To better understand the psychophysiological correlates of peritraumatic dissociation (PD), the present study examined the relationship between reports of prior PD and sympathetic and parasympathetic functioning in response to a laboratory stress paradigm in 39 traumatized female undergraduates. Participants were asked to talk about their most distressing traumatizing experience while continuous measures of heart rate, pre-ejection period, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia were taken. Overall, high dissociators had significantly larger increases in heart rate and larger decreases in pre-ejection period and respiratory sinus arrhythmia during trauma recall. In opposition to our hypothesis, these results suggest that female trauma victims reporting high levels of PD during a prior trauma may be more reactive to traumatic reminders than victims who report lower levels of PD.
