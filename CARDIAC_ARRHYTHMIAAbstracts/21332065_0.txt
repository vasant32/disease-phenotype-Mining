We described a case of 33 year-old woman with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) with first presentation as syncope in age of 14. In subsequent ECGs premature ventricular contractions (PVC) with morphology of left bundle branch block-like pattern with positive R wave in leads: II, III and aVF what suggested PVC arising from right ventricular outflow tract were observed. Nonsustained VT was observed. No ventricular arrhythmias were induced during EPS. The 2 unsuccessful sessions of ablation were performed in the right ventricular outflow area. The exercise test provoked bidirectional VT. The adrenaline infusion provoked bidirectional nonsustained VT and the U wave amplitude augmentation. Betablocker was initiated (bisoprolol). The patient is free of symptoms, only single PVC is observed.
