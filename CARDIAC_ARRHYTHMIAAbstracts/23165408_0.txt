 AIMS: The clinical features of the adult population with congenital heart disease (CHD) are still not well characterized, particularly in the subset with more severe lesions. We report the data collected in the National Association of Hospital Cardiologists Toscana grown-up CHD (GUCH) registry over its first 8-month enrolment period. METHODS: The Registry included consecutive patients aged more than 16 years with a documented diagnosis of CHD, enrolled in seven different Tuscan hospitals using a web-based electronic form. Severe CHD was defined as cyanotic CHD, or acyanotic lesion with significant haemodynamic impact requiring surgical and/or percutaneous correction. RESULTS: Between November 2009 and June 2010 a total of 1641 patients (mean age 41.8 ± 19.3 years, 52.2% women) were enrolled. Atrial septal defect was the most common lesion, accounting for more than one-third of cases. Atrial and ventricular septal defects together accounted for about half of all CHDs. Nearly one-third of patients had New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 2 or more. A history of recurrent arrhythmias was reported in 15% of cases, and 12% of patients were on oral anticoagulants at the time of enrolment. The prevalence of pulmonary hypertension was 6%, and the prevalence of Eisenmenger syndrome was 1.2%. Severe CHD was present in 42% of patients. Younger age, higher NYHA class, male sex, and the need for oral anticoagulants were the only independent predictors of severe CHD. CONCLUSION: Information about the clinical characteristics and the CHD type distribution of a sample of Tuscan GUCH population was provided. Severe CHD accounts for about 40% of all CHDs in this population. CHD severity is associated with younger age, male gender, worse NYHA class, and need for oral anticoagulation.
