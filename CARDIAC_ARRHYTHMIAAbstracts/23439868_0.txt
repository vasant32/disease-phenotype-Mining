AIMS: Cardiac pacing is a difficult technique in children, particularly in patients with congenital heart defects (CHDs). Few studies to date have addressed this topic.METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the results of a single centre. Between 1982 and 2008, 287 patients with CHD, median age of 5 years (25-75%, 1-11) underwent cardiac pacing for sinus node dysfunction (SND) and atrioventricular block (AVB); 97% of patients underwent at least one heart surgery. Endocardial systems (Endo) were implanted in 117 patients, epicardial systems (Epi) in 170, with 595 leads (228 Endo, 367 Epi). Endocardial systems showed a significantly older age group with more frequent SND; Epi a younger age group, with more frequent AVB, greater number of surgical interventions. Perioperative complications were mortality 0.6% (Epi), pericardial effusion 0.6% (Epi), and haemothorax 3.4% (Endo). The median follow-up is 5 (2-10) years: the pacing system failed in 29% of patients, 13% Endo, and 40% Epi (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed a significantly higher risk of failure for Epi, a lower implant age, greater the number of leads implanted. The risk of malfunction of the leads increases significantly for Epi and the younger age when implanted. The steroid-eluting leads have a lower risk of malfunction (P = 0.05), steroid-eluting Endo leads provide significantly better outcomes than Epi.CONCLUSION: Cardiac pacing in paediatric patients with CHD shows satisfactory results in the long term. Endocardial systems show significantly better results than Epi systems. A younger age when implanted is a risk factor for complications at follow-up.
