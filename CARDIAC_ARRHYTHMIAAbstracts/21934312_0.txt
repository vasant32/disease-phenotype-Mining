 BACKGROUND/AIMS: Post-stroke complications may influence prognosis, and may even become potentially life-threatening. The aim of this prospective study was to examine the frequency and timing of medical complications during the acute stage of critical ischemic stroke in patients treated in a neurological intensive care unit. METHODS: Seventy acute ischemic stroke patients in a critical condition with morbid changes in organs other than the brain or with severe complications were admitted to a neurological intensive care unit and followed up with assessments of 15 specified complications during the first 2 weeks on days 2, 4, 7, and 14. RESULTS: The most common complications within 2 weeks of onset were chest infection (90%), fever (64%), hypoalbuminemia (56%), arrhythmia (46%), irritable ulcer (44%), gastrointestinal dysfunction (39%), progression or recurrence of stroke (33%), and urinary tract infection (30%). The incidence of progression or recurrence of stroke and urinary tract infection peaked at day 2, and the incidence of arrhythmia, fever, chest infection, irritable ulcer, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and malnutrition peaked from 1 to 2 weeks. CONCLUSION: Progression or recurrence of stroke, fever, and chest infection are common complications in the acute stage of critical ischemic stroke.
