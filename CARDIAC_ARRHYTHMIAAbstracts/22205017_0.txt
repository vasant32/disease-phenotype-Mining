Amiodarone is a widely used antiarrythmic drug for various atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. It has the potential to cause prolongation of the QT interval, which, in turn, can increases the incidence of torsade de pointes. Amiodarone is also one of the causes of prominent U waves. The presented case exemplifies the phenomenon of amiodarone-induced T-U fusion and QT prolongation. Other causes of QT prolongation as electrolyte abnormalities or administration of other drugs that prolong the QT interval were excluded. Awareness of this phenomenon and method of calculation of QT interval in this scenario is of utmost importance.
