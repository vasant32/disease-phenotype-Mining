In this review we discuss the position of electrical neuromodulation as a safe and reversible adjuvant therapy for treatment of patients with chronic cardiac diseases who have become refractory to conventional strategies. In patients with chronic refractory angina, electrical neuromodulation, independent of the applied modality, has shown to reduce complaints of angina, to enhance exercise capacity, to improve quality of life and to employ anti-ischaemic effects. To date, electrical neuromodulation seems to be one of the best adjuvant therapies for these patients. In addition, neuromodulation in the treatment of heart failure and resistant arrhythmias is the subject of several ongoing studies.
