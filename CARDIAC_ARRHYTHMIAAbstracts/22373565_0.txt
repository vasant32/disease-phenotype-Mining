To test the feasibility of a novel method to combine magnetocardiographic (MCG) estimate of ventricular repolarization (VR) and multiple monophasic action potential (MultiMAP) recording in spontaneously breathing rodents with percutaneous sub-xyphoid epicardial placement of a MCG-compatible amagnetic catheter (AC), ten Wistar rats (WRs) and ten guinea pigs (GPs) were studied. Under fluoroscopic control, the AC was moved until four stable MAPs were recorded (fixed inter-electrode distance of 1.2 mm). 36-channel DC-SQUID (sensitivity 20 fT Hz(-½)) were used for MCG mapping. MAPs, differentially amplified (BW: DC-500 Hz), were digitized at 1 kHz. AC pacing provided local ventricular effective refractory period (VERP) estimate. MAP duration (MAPd) was measured at 50% and 90% levels of repolarization. Simultaneous MCG mapping and MultiMAP recording were successful in all animals. Average MAPd50% and MAPd90% were shorter in WRs than in GPs (26.4 ± 2.9 ms versus 110.6 ± 14.3 ms and 60.7 ± 5.4 ms versus 127.7 ± 15.3 ms, respectively). VERP was 51 ± 4.8 ms in WRs and 108.4 ± 12.9 ms in GPs, respectively. The MAP amplitude was 16.9 ± 4.5 in WRs and 16.2 ± 4.2 in GPs. MAP and MCG parameters of VR were in good agreement. All animals survived the procedure. Two also survived a second invasive study; one was followed up until natural death at 52 months. Percutaneous MultiMAP recording is minimally invasive, usually avoids animal sacrifice, is compatible with simultaneous surface MCG mapping and might be used for experimental validation of MCG VR abnormality, to study the arrhythmogenic potential of new drugs and/or animal models of ventricular arrhythmias.
