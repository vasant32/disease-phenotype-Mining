Between 1994 and 2011, we performed 133 Fontan conversions with arrhythmia surgery. Most patients had tricuspid atresia or double-inlet left ventricle with prior atriopulmonary connection. Operative mortality was 1.5%, and mean length of stay was 14 days. A total of eight patients (6%) have had late cardiac transplantation. Freedom from arrhythmia recurrence is 85% at 10 years. For properly selected patients with a functionally univentricular heart who have had an atriopulmonary Fontan procedure, Fontan conversion with arrhythmia surgery significantly improves quality of life.
