The xCELLigence real time cell analyzer Cardio system offers a new system for real-time cell analysis that measures impedance-based signals in a label-free noninvasive manner. The aim of this study was to test whether impedance readings are a useful tool to detect compound effects on beating frequency (beats per minute, bpm) and arrhythmias of human induced pluripotent stem cell- and a mouse embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte line (hiPSC-CM and mESC-CM, respectively). Baseline values for control wells were 45±3 and 179±6 bpm, respectively (n=6). Correspondingly, isoproterenol increased beating frequency by 77% and 71%, whereas carbachol decreased frequency by 11% and 100% (stopped in 5/6 mESC-CM wells). E-4031 decreased beating rate and caused arrhythmias in both cell types, however, more pronounced in the human iPSC-CMs. Amlodipine inhibited contractions in both models, and T-type calcium channel block strongly reduced beating rate and eventually stopped beating in mESC-CM but caused a smaller effect in hiPSC-CM. The results of this initial study show that, under the right conditions, the beating frequency of a monolayer of cells can be stably recorded over several days. Additionally, the system detects changes in beating frequency and amplitude caused by added reference compounds. This assay system has the potential to enable medium-throughput screening, but for implementation into routine daily work, extended validation, testing of additional batches of cardiomyocytes, and further assay optimization (e.g., frequency of media exchange, growth matrix, seeding density, age of cells after plating, and temperature control) will be needed.
