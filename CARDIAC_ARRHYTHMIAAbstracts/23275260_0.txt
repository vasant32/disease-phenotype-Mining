 BACKGROUND: Exercise-related ventricular tachycardia (VT) and high burden of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are common in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy. We hypothesized that VT in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy shows a high degree of association with the PVC at baseline. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study population included 16 consecutive arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy patients with recurrent VT who underwent catheter ablation. Median age of the patients was 27 years (range, 18-66) and 50% were men. All patients had frequent ectopy at baseline with a median PVC count of 7275 (range, 1353-19 084). During EP study, a total of 27 VTs were induced, of which 16 (59%) occurred during high-dose isoproterenol infusion. VT morphology was identical to the baseline PVCs in all the VTs induced during high-dose isoproterenol infusion. Focal ablation at the site of earliest activation and 12/12 pace map of the PVC eliminated the VT in all cases. Target site for focal ablation localized to scar border. Cumulative freedom from VT after ablation was 85.2% and 74.5% at 1 and 2 years, respectively, which was associated with a reduction in PVC count. CONCLUSIONS: We report a high degree of association between PVCs at baseline and the VTs induced during catecholamine infusion. These VTs originated from the border region of scar most commonly in the right ventricular outflow tract and right ventricle basal regions. These findings highlight the importance of catecholamine challenge and PVC mapping, which can in turn facilitate ablation of the VT in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy.
