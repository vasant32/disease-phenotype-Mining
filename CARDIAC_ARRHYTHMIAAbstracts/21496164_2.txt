 BACKGROUND: Ventricular arrhythmias are one of the main causes of sudden death in cardiac sarcoidosis (CS). Little is known about the efficacy of corticosteroid therapy for ventricular arrhythmias in CS. METHODS: Thirty-one CS patients presenting premature ventricular contractions (PVCs, ≥300/day) were investigated. Fourteen patients had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). All of patients were treated with corticosteroid, and the initial dosage is 30 mg/day of prednisone, which was tapered over a period of 6 months to a maintenance dosage of 10 mg/day. Twenty-four hour Holter monitoring, signal averaged electrocardiography (SAECG), echocardiography, gallium-67 scintigraphy, serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentrations were assessed before and after corticosteroid therapy. RESULTS: As a whole, there were no significant differences in the number of PVCs and in the prevalence of NSVT before and after steroid therapy. However, the less advanced LV dysfunction patients (EF ≥ 35%, n = 17) showed significant reduction in the number of PVCs (from 1820 ± 2969 to 742 ± 1425, P = 0.048) and in the prevalence of NSVT (from 41 to 6%, p = 0.039). Late potentials on SAECG were abolished in 3 patients. The less advanced LV dysfunction group showed a significantly higher prevalence of gallium-67 uptake compared with the advanced LV dysfunction group (EF < 35 %, n = 14). In the advanced LV dysfunction patients, there were no significant differences in these parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroid therapy may be effective for ventricular arrhythmias in the early stage, but less effective in the late stage.
