Dyslipidaemia is a major risk factor of cardiovascular diseases, the role of serum total cholesterol (Chol) especially LDL-Chol is well established in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease. Use of cholesterol lowering drugs within the first 24 h of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is associated with a lower rate of cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest and recurrent myocardial infarction. We assessed data of 416 patients admitted to hospital with AMI in a 2 year period (2001-2003) focusing on statin therapy. We have not found a correlation between serum lipid parameters and mortality of patients with AMI. Chronic statin treatment used before AMI (in 36 patients) did not influence mortality of patients. Chol level of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was significantly higher (p = 0,043). Mortality of patients who did not receive statin treatment after AMI was significantly higher. These data highlight the importance of early aggressive statin treatment in patients with AMI and necessity of statins in patients with hypercholesterolaemia.
