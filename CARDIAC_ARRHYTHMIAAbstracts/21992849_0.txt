 OBJECTIVES: We previously reported that patients with preoperative B-type natriuretic peptide levels of 30 pg/mL or more have increased risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation after pulmonary resection. This study evaluated the effects of human atrial natriuretic peptide on postoperative atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing pulmonary resection for lung cancer. METHODS: A prospective, randomized study was conducted with 40 patients who had preoperative elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (â‰¥ 30 pg/mL) and underwent a scheduled pulmonary resection for lung cancer. Results were compared between patients who received low-dose human atrial natriuretic peptide and those who received a placebo. The primary end point was the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation during the first 4 days after surgery. RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation was significantly lower in the human atrial natriuretic peptide group than in the placebo group (10% vs 60%; P < .001). Patients in the human atrial natriuretic peptide group also showed significantly lower white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein levels after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous infusion of low-dose human atrial natriuretic peptide during lung cancer surgery had a prophylactic effect against postoperative atrial fibrillation after pulmonary resection in patients with preoperative elevation of B-type natriuretic peptide levels. A larger sample size is needed to establish the safety and efficacy of this intervention.
