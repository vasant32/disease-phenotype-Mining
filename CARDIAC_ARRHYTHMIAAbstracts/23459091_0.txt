To date, research on the human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) has focused on this potassium channel's role in cardiac repolarization and Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). However, growing evidence implicates hERG in a diversity of physiologic and pathological processes. Here we discuss these other functions of hERG, particularly their impact on diseases beyond cardiac arrhythmia.
