Toxicological pharmacological study of the molecular complex of nifedipine and glycyrrhizic acid 1:10 (glycidipine) obtained using mechanochemical technique was carried out. High hypotensive and cardioprotective effects of the agent were demonstrated. Chronic administration (45 days) produced no toxic effects in vital organs and systems of Wistar rats and ISIAH rats.
