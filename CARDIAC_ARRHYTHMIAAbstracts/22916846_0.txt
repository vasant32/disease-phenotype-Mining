INTRODUCTION: Pharmacological management of cardiac arrhythmias is limited by the reduced availability of safe and effective antiarrhythmic agents. AREAS COVERED: Ranolazine is an agent currently used for the treatment of angina, which inhibits transmembrane ionic currents involved in several phases of the action potential in both the atrial and the ventricular cells. Due to its mechanism of action, ranolazine has been shown to exhibit antiarrhythmic properties that have been validated in the experimental models. This article recapitulates the mechanism of antiarrhythmic action of ranolazine, the existing clinical data, and the ongoing relevant clinical trials. EXPERT OPINION: The combination of the antiischemic properties of ranolazine with its antiarrhythmic potency and minimal proarrhythmia provides a promising background that could expand its therapeutic role in the management of atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Data derived from adequately powered randomized clinical trials will determine whether the door to a new indication will open for ranolazine in the near future.
