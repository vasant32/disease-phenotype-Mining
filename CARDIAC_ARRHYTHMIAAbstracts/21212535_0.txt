We examined the effect of NIP-142, a benzopyran compound with terminating effect on experimental atrial arrhythmia, on the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel, which underlies the slow component of the cardiac delayed rectifier potassium channel (I(Ks)). NIP-142, as well as chromanol 293B, showed concentration-dependent blockade of the current expressed in HEK293 cells; the EC(50) value of NIP-142 and chromanol 293B for the inhibition of tail current was 13.2 µM and 4.9 µM, respectively. These results indicate that NIP-142 has blocking effect on the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel current.
