Presents a short biography of one of the winners of the American Psychological Association's Award for Distinguished Scientific Early Career Contributions to Psychology. The 2012 winner is Angela J. Grippo for her creative contributions in investigating the association between depression and cardiovascular disease in preclinical animal models. Using sophisticated behavioral and neuroscience methods, Grippo found changes in sympathetic tone, immune system activation, and serotonin levels, as well as increased susceptibility to life-threatening arrhythmias, in a rodent model of depression, changes similar to those observed in humans with depression and heart disease. Her research illustrates how animal models of physiology and behavior advance understanding of the connections among depression, stress, and physical disease in humans. Grippo's Award citation and a selected bibliography are also presented here.
