Escape-capture bigeminy is a well-known arrhythmia characterized by group beating of a junctional beat followed by a conducted sinus beat. We report a variant of this arrangement where a junctional beat gives rise to a retrograde P wave, which is then conducted back to the ventricles producing a hitherto undescribed combination (escape-echo bigeminy) resembling escape-capture bigeminy. The clinical significance of escape-echo bigeminy appears similar to that of classic escape-capture bigeminy.
