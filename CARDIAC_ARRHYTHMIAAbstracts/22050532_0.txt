 BACKGROUND: Hyperuricemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular events and renal insufficiency. It correlates to intima-media thickness and microalbuminuria. In this study we evaluated uric acid as an independent marker for cardiac events in patients with diabetes. METHODS: In a prospective observational study we recruited 494 patients with diabetes. Patients were then followed for 12.8 months (mean follow-up) and hospitalizations as a result of cardiac events (ischaemic heart disease, arrhythmias, heart failure) were recorded. RESULTS: The median duration of diabetes was 11 ± 10.35 years. Patients were in the mean 60 ± 13 years old and mean HbA(1c) was 62 ± 13 mmol/mol (7.8 ± 3.3%). At baseline, mean uric acid was 321.2 ± 101.1 μmol/l (range 101.1-743.5 μmol/l), median N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide was 92 ± 412 pg/ml and median urinary albumin to creatinine ratio was 8 ± 361 mg/g; Uric acid significantly correlated to N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (r = 0.237, P < 0.001) and urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (r = 0.198, P < 0.001). In a Cox regression model, including age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, gender, systolic blood pressure, smoking and alcohol consumption, uric acid was the best predictor of cardiac events (hazard ratio 1.331, confidence interval 1.095-1.616, P = 0.04). However, uric acid lost its prognostic value when the natural logarithm of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide was added to the model. CONCLUSION: Serum uric acid is a predictor of cardiac events and correlates to N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and albuminuria, underscoring the importance of uric acid as a cardiovascular risk marker in patients with diabetes.
