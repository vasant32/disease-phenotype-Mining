Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac rhythm disorder and places a substantial burden on the US healthcare system. Unfortunately, there is no consensus as to whether patients should be treated with a primary rate- or rhythm-control strategy. The use of anti-arrhythmic drugs in the treatment of AF is discussed in the broader context of AF disease-management strategies with a focus on rhythm control. Outside of rhythm/ECG, AF treatment targets and cardiovascular outcomes are highlighted.
