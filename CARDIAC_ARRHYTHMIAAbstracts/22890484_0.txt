 AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) in patients with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) who were diagnosed by intracardiac electrophysiological study (EPS). METHOD: The study was a retrospective cohort of 378 adult patients (128 males and 250 females, 17 to 63 years) admitted with EPS. We included 267 SVT patients (58.4 % (n = 156) atria-ventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), 30 % (n = 80) atria-ventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT), 6.4 % (n = 17) atrial tachycardia (AT), and 5.2 % (n = 14) other). MVP prevalence was compared in individuals with SVT. RESULTS: MVP prevalence was found 27.7 % (n = 74) in patients with SVT. In subgroup analyses, there was a significant difference between AVRT and others about MVP prevalence (AVRT 52.7 % n = 39, AVNRT 33.8 % n = 25, AT 9.5 % n = 7, and others 4.1 % n = 3; p < 0.005). Also, there was a significant difference between females and males (75.7 % (n = 56); 24.3 % (n = 18); p < 0.05). There was a significant negative correlation between age and MVP just in female group (r = -0.116, p = 0.024). CONCLUSION: It was demonstrated in our study that AVRT and female sex may be related to MVP in SVT patients. It was dedicated from these results that the existence of arrhythmia should be focused on young female subjects with MVP more than the others.
