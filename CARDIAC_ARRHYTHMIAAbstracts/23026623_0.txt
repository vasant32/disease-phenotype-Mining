 INTRODUCTION: Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) plays an important role in allograft surveillance to screen an acute rejection episode after heart transplantation (HT), to diagnose an unknown cause of cardiomyopathies (CMP) or to reveal a cardiac tumor. However, the procedure is not risk free. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this research was to describe our experience with EMB during the last 33 years comparing surgical risk between HT versus no-HT patients. METHOD: We analyzed retrospectively the data of 5347 EMBs performed from 1978 to 2011 (33 years). For surveillance of acute rejection episodes after HT we performed 3564 (66.7%), whereas 1777 (33.2%) for CMP diagnosis, and 6 (1.0%) for cardiac tumor identification. RESULTS: The main complications due to EMB were divided into 2 groups to facilitate analysis: major complications associated with potential death risk, and minor complications. The variables that showed a significant difference in the HT group were as follows: tricuspid injury (.0490) and coronary fistula (.0000). Among the no-HT cohort they were insufficient fragment (.0000), major complications (.0000) and total complications (.0000). CONCLUSIONS: EMB can be accomplished with a low risk of complications and high effectiveness to diagnose CMP and rejection after HT. However, the risk is great among patients with CMP due to their anatomic characteristics. Children also constitute a risk group for EMB due to their small size in addition to the heart disease. The risk of injury to the tricuspid valve was higher among the HT group.
