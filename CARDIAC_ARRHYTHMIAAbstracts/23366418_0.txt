The Corventis NUVANTâ„¢ Mobile Cardiac Telemetry system is an innovative solution in the field of continuous monitoring of symptomatic and asymptomatic cardiac abnormalities to help physicians diagnose and treat non-lethal cardiac arrhythmias. As an FDA cleared product on the market for more than 2 years, the collected body of patient data represents a unique and powerful source of clinical information. Analysis of a sample of 951 NUVANT patients has revealed interesting statistics on the prevalence of various cardiac arrhythmias in the patient population. The population is non-randomized and largely consists of US patients where a traditional Holter Monitor study was negative. The analysis here is focused on classifying the detected arrhythmias using potential therapy solutions as a classifier. Across the total population, 2.2% of patients presented arrhythmias indicating assessment for clinically significant tachycardia, 19% indications of potential bradycardia, 20% had indications of atrial fibrillation, 1% indicating arrhythmias requiring other conditional treatment, and 58% presenting arrhythmias likely not requiring treatment.
