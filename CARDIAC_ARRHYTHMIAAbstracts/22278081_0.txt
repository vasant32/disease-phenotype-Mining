Sleep-disordered breathing is one of the most common sleep disorders. Especially obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an independent cardiovascular risk factor. Clinical studies have proven a significant association between OSA and atrial fibrillation, the most common cardiac arrhythmia. Currently, there is no proven evidence for causality. Untreated OSA seems to be a risk factor for failure of rhythm control strategy in atrial fibrillation. The recurrence rate after cardioversion is higher in case of additional untreated OSA. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in OSA patients could reduce relapse rate. However, there is a lack of randomized controlled clinical trials with defined end points on this topic. A specific sleep medicine interview as well as sleep studies with portable monitoring and cardiorespiratory polysomnography are recommended when sleep-disordered breathing is suspected. Procedures for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation are given.
