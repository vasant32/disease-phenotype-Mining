Brugada syndrome is an inherited disorder that predisposes some patients to sudden cardiac death. It is not well established which Brugada syndrome patients are at risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. We investigated whether standard 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) can identify such patients. The subjects were 35 men with Brugada syndrome (mean age, 50.1 ± 12.4 years). Documented ventricular fibrillation or aborted sudden cardiac arrests were judged to be related to the Brugada syndrome. Ten patients (mean age, 49.6 ± 14.9 years) were symptomatic, and 25 (mean age, 50.3 ± 11.5 years) were asymptomatic. We determined the PR interval, QRS duration, and QT interval from baseline 12-lead ECG leads II and V2 as well as the J point elevation amplitude of lead V2. The QRS interval was measured from QRS onset to the J point in leads II and V2. The only significant difference between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients was the QRS duration measured from lead V2. The mean QRS interval was 129.0 ± 23.9 ms in symptomatic patients versus 108.3 ± 15.9 ms in asymptomatic patients (P = 0.012). A QRS interval in lead V2 ≥ 120 ms was found to be a possible predictor of a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia and/or syncope (P = 0.012). Prolonged QRS duration as measured on a standard 12-lead ECG is associated with ventricular arrhythmia and could serve as a simple noninvasive marker of vulnerability to life-threatening cardiac events in patients with Brugada syndrome.
