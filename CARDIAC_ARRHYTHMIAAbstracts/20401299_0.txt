The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab is an effective treatment for small lymphocytic lymphoma; however, it has been associated with infusion reactions, including cardiac arrhythmias. Severe cardiac arrhythmia is an adverse reaction that is related to rituximab chemotherapy, and more investigation is warranted into the adverse reactions of rituximab that involve cardiac conduction abnormalities. Herein, we report what we believe to be the 1st case of symptomatic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia to have occurred during an initial infusion of rituximab.
