Approximately 1% of adults who undergo cardiac catheterization have coronary anomalies. Patients may present with chest pain, arrhythmias, presyncope, and sometimes sudden cardiac death. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is an excellent tool for identifying coronary artery anomalies and defining their course and relationship to the great vessels and surrounding structures; its value is incremental to conventional angiography. We present a rare case of a coronary anomaly involving three separate ostia at the right sinus of Valsalva for the left and right coronary vessels.
