 AIMS: We investigated the role of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NTpro-BNP), in atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence rate. METHODS: A total of 80 patients with first AF episode were studied prospectively. Echocardiography (ECG), Holter ECG, and measurements of hsCRP, IL-6, and NTproBNP were performed immediately post conversion and at 1 month. RESULTS: Recurrence was positively related to left atrial volume (P < .001), with no difference in NTpro-BNP, hsCRP, and IL-6. Decreased NTpro-BNP was observed in all at 1 month (P < .001, F = 63.4) and was positively related to left atrial volume (P < .01). In the lone AF subgroup, NTpro-BNP was lower and dropped significantly at 1 month (interaction F = 6.53, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Atrial volume was related to AF recurrence, whereas hsCRP, IL-6, and NTpro-BNP were not reliable for AF relapse. Relation of NTpro-BNP to left atrial volume could indicate a role in the atrial remodeling process.
