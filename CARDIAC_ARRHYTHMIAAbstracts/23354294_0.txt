The evaluation of syncope in severe aortic stenosis usually requires intense work-up. Mechanical obstruction should not always be implicated as the underlying cause of syncope. Syncope at rest may be rarely associated with ventricular arrhythmias. We present a patient with severe aortic stenosis who experienced syncopal events due to torsade de pointes.
