 BACKGROUND: Sex hormones and gender differences are associated with the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias. AIM: To investigate the relationship between sex hormones and idiopathic outflow tract ventricular arrhythmias (IOTVA), and the effect of oestrogen replacement therapy on IOTVA, in postmenopausal female patients. METHODS: Plasma sex hormone concentrations and ventricular arrhythmia counts were estimated in postmenopausal patients with IOTVA and control postmenopausal women. The effect of oestrogen replacement therapy on IOTVA was observed in postmenopausal patients with IOTVA. RESULTS: The concentration of oestradiol in postmenopausal patients with IOTVA was significantly lower than that in control postmenopausal women (8.4 ± 3.4 vs 36.9 ± 12.8pg/mL, respectively; P<0.001). The ventricular arrhythmia count in postmenopausal patients with IOTVA was significantly higher than that in controls (10,171 ± 6091 vs 209 ± 468 counts/24 hours, respectively; P<0.001). After 3 months of oestrogen replacement therapy, the ventricular arrhythmia count was significantly lower than that before therapy (3958 ± 1972 vs 10171 ± 6091 counts/24 hours, respectively; P<0.001). CONCLUSION: This study showed that the concentration of oestradiol was lower in postmenopausal patients with IOTVA than in control postmenopausal women, and that oestrogen replacement therapy can inhibit effectively the genesis of IOTVA.
