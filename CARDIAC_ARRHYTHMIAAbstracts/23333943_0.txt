 AIMS: Sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk can be managed by implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD). Defibrillation shocks can be delivered via ICD generator and/or intracardiac or subcutaneous coil configurations. We present our single-centre use of childhood ICDs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-three patients had ICD implantation, with median age and weight of 12.96 years and 41.35 kg. Indications included eight long QT; four hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; three Brugada syndrome; two idiopathic ventricular fibrillation; two post-congenital heart repair; two family history of SCD with abnormal repolarization; one catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia; and one left ventricle non-compaction. Twelve had out of hospital cardiac arrests prior to implantation. Techniques included 13 conventional ICD implants (pre-pectoral device with endocardial leads), 7 with subcutaneous defibrillation coils (sensing via epicardial or endocardial leads tunnelled to the ICD), and 3 with exclusive subcutaneous ICD (sensing and defibrillation via the same subcutaneous lead). Satisfactory defibrillation efficacy and ventricular arrhythmia sensing was confirmed at implantation. Follow-up ranged from 0.17 to 11.08 years. One child died with the ICD in situ. Ten children received appropriate shocks; five on more than one occasion. Five received inappropriate shocks (for inappropriate recognition of sinus tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia). Five children underwent six further interventions; all had intracardiac leads. CONCLUSION: Innovative shock delivery systems can be used in children requiring an ICD. The insertion technique and device used need to accommodate the age and weight of the child, and concomitant need for pacing therapy. We have demonstrated effective defibrillation with shocks delivered via configurations employing subcutaneous coils in children.
