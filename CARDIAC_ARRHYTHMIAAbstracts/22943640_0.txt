 OBJECTIVE: The prognostic value of corrected QT interval (QTc), corrected Tp-e interval (Tp-ec) and Tp-e/QT ratio on occurrence of malignant arrhythmia events (MAE) in acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients underwent successful thrombolysis was explored and the potential association of these indices with MAE was analyzed. METHODS: Fifty-seven STEMI patients underwent successful thrombolytic therapy within 6 hours after admission and conservative medical treatment were included. QTc, Tp-ec, Tp-e/QT ratio were obtained and calculated in infarct-related electrocardiograph leads and non-infarct-related leads before thrombolysis, (7±1) days and (30±3) days after thrombolysis respectively, and incidence of MAE up to 30 days after thrombolysis was analyzed. Sixty age and gender matched normal subjects served as control group. RESULTS: (1) QTc, Tp-ec, Tp-e/QT in infarct-related and non-infarct-related leads in STEMI group before thrombolysis were significantly higher than those in control group (all P<0.05), and values from the infarct-related leads were significantly higher than those from non-infarct-related leads in STEMI group (all P<0.05). QTc, Tp-ec and Tp-e/QT all significantly and continuously reduced from 7 days and at 30 days post thrombolysis compared the before thrombolysis (P<0.05 vs. before thrombolysis). (2) Tp-ec≥100 ms and Tp-e/QT ratio≥0.25 before thrombolysis in infarct-related leads were linked with higher incidence of MAE within 30 days post thrombolysis in this patient cohort [28.1% (9/32) vs. 40% (1/25), 27.8% (10/36) vs.0, respectively, all P<0.05]. CONCLUSION: QTc, Tp-ec and Tp-e/QT values decreased post successful thrombolysis in STEMI patients and higher Tp-ec and Tp-e/QT values before thrombolysis in STEMI patients were related with higher MAE incidence up to 30 days post successful thrombolysis in this patient cohort.
