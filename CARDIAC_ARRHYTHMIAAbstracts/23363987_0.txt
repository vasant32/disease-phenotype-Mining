 OBJECTIVES: Ventricular arrhythmia (VA) in the setting of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) carries an ominous prognosis; however, long-term prognosis associated with VA in ACS in the Middle East is unknown. Accordingly, we sought to assess the incidence, in-hospital outcomes, and 1-year mortality of in-hospital VA in patients with ACS. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Second Gulf Registry of Acute Coronary Events (Gulf RACE-2) is a multinational observational study of patients with ACS, which enrolled 7930 patients. Of these, 333 (4.2%) developed VA during hospitalization. Patients with VA were significantly older (mean age 58.3 vs. 56.8 years), and had a significantly higher rate of prior stroke/transient ischemic attack (7.5 vs. 4.2%), smoking (36.6 vs. 35.6%), congestive heart failure (11.0 vs. 6.5%), and peripheral artery disease (6.5 vs. 1.7%), compared with patients without VA. They had significantly less diabetes mellitus (35.4 vs. 40.3%), hypertension (43.2 vs. 47.9%), percutaneous coronary intervention (6.1 vs. 9.4%), and dyslipidemia (22.4 vs. 38.2%). The adjusted odds ratios for in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year mortality in VA complicating all ACS were 25.8, 11.1, and 7.3; ST-elevation myocardial infarctions were 18.3, 11.7, and 6.3; and unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarctions were 47.4, 10.3, and 18.7, respectively (all P<0.001). CONCLUSION: In-hospital VA in patients with ACS with and without ST elevation was associated with significantly higher in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year mortality. Noticeably higher long-term mortality among Middle Eastern patients with ACS having VA compared with other reports requires further study and warrants immediate attention.
