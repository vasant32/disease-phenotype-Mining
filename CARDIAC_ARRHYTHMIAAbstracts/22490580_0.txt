 BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that β-blockers can improve cardiac performance in heart failure (HF) by reversing protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ leak. However, it is being strongly questioned as to whether the PKA-mediated ryanodine receptor (RyR2) hyper-phosphorylation is a critical regulator of SR Ca2+ leak. In this study, we used a rabbit HF model to investigate whether β-blockers affect SR Ca2+ leak by other potential mechanisms. METHODS: New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided in three groups (n=7 in each group): normal group, metoprolol-untreated group and metoprolol-treated group. Cardiac function was determined by echocardiography and hemodynamic assays. The SR Ca2+ leak was measured by a calcium-imaging device, and the expression and activities of related proteins were evaluated by Western blotting and auto-phosphorylation. RESULTS: In the metoprolol-untreated group, there was significantly increased ventricular cavity size, reduced systolic function, increased SR Ca2+ leak, reduced associated amount of FK506 binding protein 12.6 (FKBP12.6), increased expression and activity of PKA and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and increased phosphorylated RyR2 phosphorylation sites (with unchanged RyR2-P2030). In the treated group, there was partly increased ventricular cavity size with preserved systolic function, but no prominent Ca2+ leak, with unchanged expression and activity of PKA, CaMKII and their RyR2 phosphorylation sites. CONCLUSION: Chronic administration of metoprolol prevented the SR Ca2+ leak by restoring not only PKA-dependent but also CaMKII-dependent hyper-phosphorylation of RyR2, which may be one of the potential mechanisms by which β-blockers improve cardiac function and reduce the incidence of fatal arrhythmia in HF.
