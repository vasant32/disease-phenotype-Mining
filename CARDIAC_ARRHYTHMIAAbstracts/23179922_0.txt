 PURPOSE: We examined the role of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway in low-level vagus nerve stimulation (LLVNS)-mediated inhibition of atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS: In 17 pentobarbital anesthetized dogs, bilateral thoracotomies allowed the attachment of electrode catheters to the superior and inferior pulmonary veins and atrial appendages. Rapid atrial pacing (RAP) was maintained for 6 h. Each hour, programmed stimulation was used to determine the window of vulnerability (WOV), a measure of AF inducibility, at all sites. During the last 3 h, RAP was overlapped with right LLVNS (50 % below that which slows the sinus rate). In group 1 (n = 7), LLVNS was the only intervention, whereas in groups 2 (n = 6) and 3 (n = 4), the NO synthase inhibitor N (G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, respectively, were injected in the right-sided ganglionated plexi (GP) during the last 3 h. The duration of acetylcholine-induced AF was determined at baseline and at 6 h. Voltage-sinus rate curves were constructed to assess GP function. RESULTS: LLVNS significantly decreased the acetylcholine-induced AF duration by 8.2 ± 0.9 min (p < 0.0001). Both L-NAME and wortmannin abrogated this effect. The cumulative WOV (the sum of the individual WOVs) decreased toward baseline with LLVNS (p < 0.0001). L-NAME and wortmannin blunted this effect during the fifth (L-NAME only, p < 0.05) and the sixth hour (L-NAME and wortmannin, p < 0.05). LLVNS suppressed the ability of GP stimulation to slow the sinus rate, whereas L-NAME and wortmannin abolished this effect. CONCLUSION: The anti-arrhythmic effects of LLVNS involve the PI3K/NO signaling pathway.
