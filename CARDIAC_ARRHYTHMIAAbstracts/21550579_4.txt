A substantial proportion of patients who meet the current guidelines for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) fail to respond to this pacing modality. Although appropriate patient selection and left ventricular (LV) lead location have been ascribed as determinants of CRT response, the interaction among contractile reserve, dynamics of dyssynchrony, and lead location is not well understood. The present study prospectively evaluated the effect of contractile reserve and dobutamine-induced changes in LV synchrony, in relation to the LV lead location, as predictors of the response to CRT. In the present study, 31 patients were prospectively evaluated and underwent low-dose dobutamine echocardiography. The dobutamine-induced increase in ejection fraction (contractile reserve [CR]) was measured, and the most mechanically delayed segment was identified to classify patients into 2 groups. Group 1 had a CR of >20% and a LV lead position concordant with the mechanically delayed segment. Group 2 included the remaining patients (i.e., low CR, discordant LV lead position, or both). Patients in group 1 were significantly more likely to have an echocardiographic response at 6 months (80% of group 1 vs 29% of group 2, p = 0.018) and had an improved 2-year heart failure hospitalization-free survival rate (90% in group 1 vs 33% in group 2, p = 0.006). In conclusion, low-dose dobutamine echocardiography provides information that can help to predict responders to CRT. The response rates and heart failure hospitalization-free survival were improved in those patients with a CR >20% and an LV lead tip concordant with the most delayed mechanical segment.
