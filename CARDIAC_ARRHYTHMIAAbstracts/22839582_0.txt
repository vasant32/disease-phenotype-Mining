We carried out clinico-economical analysis of 2 tactics of rhythm restoration in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) lasting less than 48 hours: cardioversion at prehospital stage with intravenous procainamide and inhospital cardioversion with any method. This retrospective study was based on the data from department of urgent aid of an outpatient clinic. The results showed that within 48 hours inhospital was a was more effective, safe, and more economically profitable compared with administration of procainamide at prehospital stage.  Intravenous procainamide resulted in effective cardioversion in 70.6% of patients. It was associated with arterial hypotension and proarrhythmogenic action in 14,7% of cases. Patients with effective cardioversion with procainamide had lesser mean values of left ventricular anterior-posterior dimension (echocardiography) and shorter duration of arrhythmia.
