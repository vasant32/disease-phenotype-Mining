Ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) by conventional radiofrequency ablation can be impossible if the ventricular wall at the targeted ablation site is very thick, as for example the ventricular septum. We present a case of a patient with incessant, non-sustained slow VT originating from the septal part of the lower outflow tracts. Radiofrequency catheter ablation from both ventricles as well as from the anterior cardiac vein were not successful. Both high power radiofrequency ablation and bipolar radiofrequency ablation neither were successfull. Finally, ethanol ablation of the first septal perforator successfully terminated arrhythmia. We discuss the possibilities to overcome failed conventional radiofrequency VT ablation of a septal focus.
