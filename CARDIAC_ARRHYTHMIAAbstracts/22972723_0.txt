QUESTION: I often prescribe domperidone to women as a galactagogue starting at a dose of 30 mg and increasing the dose as needed. In March of this year, Health Canada released an advisory warning of domperidone use and abnormal heart rhythms and sudden cardiac death. Should I cap doses at 30 mg or stop prescribing domperidone all together to these women? ANSWER: The Health Canada warning is based on 2 studies. The results of the studies are not directly applicable to breastfeeding and should not change the way you normally manage otherwise healthy breastfeeding women.
