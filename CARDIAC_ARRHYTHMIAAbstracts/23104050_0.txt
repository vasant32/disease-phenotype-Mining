 INTRODUCTION: Developing an ablation strategy when the clinical arrhythmia cannot be induced is a challenge. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 72-year-old man is transferred to our facility for ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm. Endocardial and epicardial voltage mapping was normal and program stimulation failed to induce any arrhythmias. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) electrograms (EGMs) were recorded while pacing and compared to the stored clinical events. Ablation lesions were delivered across a narrow area of matching ICD EGM pace maps. The patient has remained arrhythmia free for 11 months. CONCLUSION: ICD EGMs may be useful in facilitating successful VT ablation when the clinical arrhythmia cannot be induced in the EP lab.
