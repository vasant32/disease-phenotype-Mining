An isolated congenital left ventricular diverticulum, which is characterized by the local failure of the ventricular muscle during embryologic development, is a rare cardiac abnormality that may be found in isolated form or in the accompaniment of other cardiac abnormalities. Clinically, it has been reported to follow an asymptomatic course in the majority of cases; however, it may cause heart failure, arrhythmia, or chest pain in some patients.
