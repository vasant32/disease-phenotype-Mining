Digoxin has been used for hundreds of years to aid rate control in atrial fibrillation and as a positive inotrope in heart failure. Our familiarity with digoxin has allowed it to become easily prescribed even though there are data suggesting that use of digoxin may in fact result in increased mortality and pro-arrhythmia. Within this review we explain some of the outcome data associated with digoxin use to determine if it is time to take the gloves off and examine if we should still be using this drug in the 21st century.
