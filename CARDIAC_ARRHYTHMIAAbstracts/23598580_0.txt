BACKGROUND: Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) experience elevated cardiac stress because of the repetitive and intermittent character of dialysis. Changes in ventricular electrical systole induced by necessary dialysis significantly contribute to predict sudden death due to arrhythmia in ESKD. OBJECTIVE: The major objective of this study was to assess the behavior of ventricular repolarization in dialysis by analyzing QTc interval and QTc dispersion. METHODS: This study sample consisted of 47 patients undergoing hemodialysis (61.7% males and 38.3% females), whose mean age was 66.79±13.16 years. All of them underwent three electrocardiograms performed before, during and after one dialysis session. Ventricular electrical systole was analyzed later. RESULTS: An increase in maximum QTc interval and QTc dispersion associated with dialysis was observed. In addition, an increase in the number of individuals meeting the electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was observed. After dialysis, higher means of the maximum QTc interval (473 ± 27.63 mseg) and of the QTc dispersion (58.95 ± 18.87 mseg) were observed in individuals with LVH as compared with those in individuals without LVH (455.21 ± 26.85 mseg and 44 ± 16.41 mseg, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study confirmed an increase in the QTc interval and QTc dispersion associated with dialysis. That emphasizes the dependence of ventricular repolarization on fluid and electrolyte balance, and suggests a profile of higher vulnerability to arrhythmia associated with dialysis .
