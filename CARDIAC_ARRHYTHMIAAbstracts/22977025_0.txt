Lymphoma of the heart and pericardium is usually present as one aspect of disseminated disease and rarely occurs as a primary malignancy. It accounts for 1.3% of primary cardiac tumors and 0.5% of extranodal lymphomas. Cardiac lymphomas are most commonly diffuse large cell lymphomas and frequently manifest as an ill-defined, infiltrative mass. Atrial location is typical; the right atrium is most often affected. Pericardial thickening or effusion is often a common early feature of disease. Infiltration of atrial or ventricular walls with extension along epicardial surfaces is also a notable feature. At computed tomography, the attenuation of cardiac lymphoma may be similar to or lower than that of normal myocardium. At magnetic resonance imaging, it has variable signal intensity and contrast enhancement. Clinical manifestations may include pericardial effusion, cardiac arrhythmias, and a variety of nonspecific electrocardiographic abnormalities, notably first- to third-degree atrioventricular block. Treatment most commonly includes anthracycline-based chemotherapy and anti-CD20 treatment. Chemotherapy has been used alone or combined with radiation therapy. Palliative surgery has been performed, mainly for tumor debulking. The prognosis for patients with either primary or secondary lymphomatous heart involvement is usually poor; late diagnosis is one of the major factors affecting outcome.
