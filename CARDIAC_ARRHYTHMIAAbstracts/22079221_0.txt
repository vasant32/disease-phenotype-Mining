The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of various doses of exogenous vasopressin (AVP) against ischemia-reperfusion injury in anesthetized rat heart. Anesthetized rats were randomly divided into seven groups (n=4-13) and all of them subjected to prolonged 30 min regional ischemia and 120 min reperfusion. Group I served as saline control with ischemia, in treatment groups II, III, IV and V, respectively different doses of AVP (0.015, 0.03, 0.06 and 1.2 μg/rat) were infused within 10 min prior to ischemia, in group VI, an AVP-selective V1 receptor antagonist (SR49059, 1mg/kg, i.v.) was administrated prior to effective dose of AVP injection and in group VII, SR49059 (1 mg/kg, i.v.) was only administrated prior to ischemia. Various doses of AVP significantly prevented the decrease in heart rate (HR) at the end of reperfusion compared to their baseline and decreased infarct size, biochemical parameters [LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), CK-MB (creatine kinase-MB) and MDA (malondialdehyde) plasma levels], severity and incidence of ventricular arrhythmia, episodes and duration of ventricular tachycardia (VT) as compared to control group. Blockade of V1 receptors by SR49059 attenuated the cardioprotective effect of AVP on ventricular arrhythmias and biochemical parameters, but partially returned infarct size to control. AVP 0.03 μg/rat was known as effective dose. Our results showed that AVP owns a cardioprotective effect probably via V1 receptors on cardiac myocyte against ischemia/reperfusion injury in rat heart in vivo.
