 BACKGROUND: A canine right atrial (RA) linear lesion model was used to produce a complex pattern of RA activation to evaluate a novel mapping system for rapid, high resolution (HR) electroanatomical mapping. METHODS AND RESULTS: The mapping system (Rhythmia Medical, Incorporated) uses an 8F deflectable catheter with a minibasket (1.8 cm diameter), containing 8 splines of 8 electrodes (total 64 electrodes, 2.5 mm spacing). The system automatically acquires electrograms and location information based on electrogram stability and respiration phase. In 10 anesthetized dogs, HR-RA map was obtained by maneuvering the minibasket catheter during sinus rhythm and coronary sinus pacing. A right thoracotomy was performed, and either 1 or 2 (to create a gap) epicardial linear lesions were created on the RA free wall (surgical incision or epicardial radiofrequency lesions). RA maps during RA pacing close to the linear lesions were obtained. A total of 73 maps were created, with 44 to 729 (median 237) beats and 833 to 12 412 (median 3589) electrograms (≤2 to ≤5 mm from surface geometry), resolution 1.8 to 5.3 (median 2.7) mm, and 2.6 to 26.3 (median 7.3) minutes mapping time. Without manual annotation, the system accurately created RA geometry and demonstrated RA activation, identifying the location of lines of block and presence or absence of a gap in all 10 dogs. Endocardial radiofrequency catheter ablation of a gap (guided by activation map) produced complete block across the gap in all 3 dogs tested. CONCLUSIONS: The new HR mapping system accurately and quickly identifies geometry and complex patterns of activation in the canine RA, with little or no manual annotation of activation time.
