Symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias are a very disturbing sign to well-trained athletes, warranting prompt diagnosis and therapy, preferably not interfering with their physical performance at the time. A case is presented where exercise induced atrial flutter occurred in the aftermath of a viral infection. Basic tools like holter-monitoring and a heart-rate meter provided insight and understanding. Arrhythmia management really is a joint venture between athlete and physician to provide a tailor-made solution, using interventional techniques, cardiovascular conditioning and sometimes a pharmaceutical agent, all together carefully auto-monitored.
