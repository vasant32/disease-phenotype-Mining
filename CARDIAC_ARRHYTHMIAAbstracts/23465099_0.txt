Dronedarone is a novel class III antiarrhythmic drug with moderate efficacy in preventing atrial arrhythmias. However, only few data from the real-world use of dronedarone with limited electrocardiographic monitoring are available. The investigators report the incidence, timing, and reasons for discontinuation of dronedarone; maintenance of sinus rhythm; and atrial arrhythmia recurrence patterns in 120 consecutive patients with atrial fibrillation (AF; n = 91) or non-isthmus-dependent atrial flutter (n = 29) treated with dronedarone (400 mg twice daily). Rhythm control was assessed with serial 7-day Holter electrocardiography after 4 weeks and after 6 to 9 months. After drug initiation, dronedarone was discontinued in 19 patients (16%) because of inefficacy (n = 7 [6%]) or adverse events (n = 12 [10%]). At 4 weeks, 44 patients (37%) had stopped taking dronedarone because of inefficacy (n = 27 [23%]) or adverse events (n = 17 [14%]). After 6 to 9 months, 25 patients (21%) had discontinued dronedarone because of clinical inefficacy (n = 16 [13%]) or adverse events (n = 9 [8%]). Overall, dronedarone was still used after 6 to 9 months in 32 patients (27%). Maintenance of sinus rhythm was achieved in 40 patients (33%) after 4 weeks and in 24 patients (20%) after 6 to 9 months. Reversal from persistent to paroxysmal arrhythmias was observed in 23 patients, (29%) whereas progression from paroxysmal to persistent arrhythmias occurred in 6 patients (15%). Conversion from AF to non-isthmus-dependent atrial flutter was noted in 10 patients (13%). In conclusion, dronedarone is associated with frequent adverse events and moderate antiarrhythmic efficacy requiring discontinuation in most patients within the first 9 months of use, and there is a prevalent reversal from persistent to paroxysmal but also from paroxysmal to persistent atrial arrhythmias and from AF to non-isthmus-dependent atrial flutter.
