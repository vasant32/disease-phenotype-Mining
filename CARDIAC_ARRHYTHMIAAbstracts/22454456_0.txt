We performed a survey on current practice of atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and monitoring and its relevance in patient management among the European Heart Rhythm Association Research Network. The focus of this questionnaire is on the use and relevance of remote AF detection in device patients and its clinical consequences like starting oral anticoagulation or improving device programming to avoid inappropriate shock therapy. Remote device data are already used by 76.8% of the centres in their implantable cardioverter defibrillator/cardiac resynchronization therapy device patients to detect AF and trigger relevant clinical decision making! The majority of these centres are also asking for the option of remote device programming.
