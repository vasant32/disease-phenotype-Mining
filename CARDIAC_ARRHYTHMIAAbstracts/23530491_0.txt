Dual atrioventricular (AV) nodal nonreentrant tachycardia is an uncommon arrhythmia with several pattern types. The primary therapy is ablation of the slow AV nodal pathway. A rare pattern type demonstrates alternating 1:2 and 1:1 AV ratios with longer PR intervals during 1:1 conduction. We report the second intracardiac study of this variant and the first case of using right atrial pacing as the ultimate therapy for any pattern type.
