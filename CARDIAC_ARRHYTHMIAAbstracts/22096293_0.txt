Arrhythmias in pregnancy are common and may cause concern for the well-being of both mother and fetus.

However, the incidence of subsequent heart block is low. This case report highlights the occurrence of perioperative arrhythmias following sympathetic blockade in pregnant patients and their early detection by vigilant monitoring.
