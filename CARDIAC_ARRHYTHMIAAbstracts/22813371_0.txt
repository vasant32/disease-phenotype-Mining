Cardiovascular drugs are used in pregnancy to treat maternal and fetal conditions. Mothers may also require drug therapy postpartum. Most cardiovascular drugs taken by pregnant women can cross the placenta and therefore expose the developing embryo and fetus to their pharmacologic and teratogenic effects. These effects are influenced by the intrinsic pharmacokinetic properties of a given drug and by the complex physiologic changes occurring during pregnancy. Many drugs are also transferred into human milk with potential adverse effects on the nursing infant. This article summarizes some of the literature concerning the risks and benefits of using cardiovascular drugs during pregnancy.
