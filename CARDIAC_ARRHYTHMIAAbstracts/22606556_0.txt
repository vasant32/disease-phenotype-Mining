Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic disorder of unknown aetiology characterised by the formation of noncaseating epithelioid cell granuloma involving various organ systems. Cardiac involvement has an important prognostic factor as it can present with life-threatening arrythmias and sudden death. Here, we present a case of cardiac sarcoidosis in a 46-year-old gentleman who presented with nonspecific signs and symptoms. We also discuss diagnostic difficulties especially when cardiac involvement is the only clinical sign. In this case, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) played an important role in the diagnosis and followup of our patient.
