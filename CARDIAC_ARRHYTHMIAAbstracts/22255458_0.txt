Arrhythmia (i.e., irregular cardiac beat) classification in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is an important issue for heart disease diagnosis due to the non-invasive nature of the ECG exam. In this paper, we analyze and criticize the results of some arrhythmia classification methods presented in the literature in terms of how the samples are chosen for training/testing the classifier and the impact this choice has on their performance (i.e., accuracy/sensitivity/specificity). From our implementation, we also report new accuracies for these methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art method, in terms of results.
