Dronedarone (Multaq), an analogue of amiodarone (Cordarone), was designed to cause fewer adverse effects than the parent compound. Studies have indeed shown dronedarone to be safer than amiodarone, but less effective. Its official indication is to reduce the risk of hospitalization in patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter and other cardiovascular risk factors, reflecting the parameters of its effectiveness in clinical trials.
