Cardiogenic shock is most commonly a complication of acute myocardial infarction. The ischemic loss of functional myocardium triggers distinct cardiovascular responses which can deteriorate to global pump failure with a mortality rate of more than 50%. Causes of cardiogenic shock beyond myocardial ischemia are very diverse. Decisive management with rapid evaluation, identification of the underlying disease and urgent initiation of supportive measures as well as definitive therapy is of prognostic value. Causal treatment of the cardiac disease is crucial but has to be weighed against the specific surgical circumstances of perioperative patients, particularly concerning anticoagulation, platelet inhibition and bleeding risks. Hemodynamic stabilization is achieved by pharmacological support of myocardial function, control of arrhythmia and volume load. Prevention and intensive care of shock-related multiorgan failure is of pivotal importance in the successful management of cardiogenic shock.
