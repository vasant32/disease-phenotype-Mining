The treatment of bipolar disorders is based on the concomitant use of the mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. In the first case carbamazepine is frequently used, in the second case second-generation (atypical) neuroleptics like quetiapine. This drug combination in a significant number of cases prevent recurrence of mania and depression, normalizes mood and emotion and improves lifestyle. However, this treatment is related to increased interactions and risk of the side effects. Even greater risks involve mixed drug intoxications with these groups of drugs. In this paper we present acute poisoning with carbamazepine and quetiapine complicated cardiotoxic effects in the form of arrhythmias and conduction disorders of the heart. This symptoms disappeared spontaneously after resolution of the poisoning.
