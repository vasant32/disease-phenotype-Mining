Cardiac resynchronization therapy has been shown to produce reverse ventricular remodelling in patients with severe heart failure. We report an unusual case of T-wave oversensing, most likely as a consequence of reverse ventricular remodelling resulting in change of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator lead redundancy.
