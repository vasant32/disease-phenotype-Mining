Electrocardiographic tracings of an English Bulldog referred for cardiogenic shock due to an orthodromic atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia conducted with intraventricular conduction disturbance and mimicking ventricular tachycardia (VT) are presented. At admission the surface ECG showed a wide QRS complex tachycardia (WCT) that was converted to sinus rhythm using manual cardioversion (chest thump). This change revealed pre-existing right bundle branch block, and a final diagnosis of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with intraventricular conduction disturbance was made. Electrophysiologic study defined the SVT mechanism as an atrioventricular macroreentrant tachycardia mediated by a single mid-septal accessory pathway. The differentiation between various types of WCT is essential when antiarrhythmic therapy is considered. The surface ECG should be systematically evaluated in order to recognize the characteristic features of SVT and VT. Moreover chest thump procedure can be very helpful in the attempt to convert the rhythm to sinus rhythm and to correctly recognize the underlying arrhythmia.
