One of the greatest challenges in medicine consists of arriving at a correct diagnosis despite different presentations of the disease. We present a case in which, notwithstanding the initial diagnosis, the search for the etiology was essential for clinical guidance. Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) was first described by Chin et al. in 1990. This relatively new entity is characterized by excessive thickening of the myocardial wall, formed of a thin epicardial layer and a substantially thicker non-compacted endocardial layer. The clinical presentation is highly variable but it must always be borne in mind that heart failure, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias and embolic events are common complications of LVNC.
