Kala-azar or visceral leishmaniasis is a disseminated protozoal infection caused by parasites of the genus Leishmania (Leishmania donovani in India). Conventional therapy for visceral leishmaniasis continues to be pentavalent antimony (sodium antimony gluconate [SAG]). Amphotericin B is widely used for SAG-unresponsive cases and sometimes even as a first-line drug, especially in endemic areas. With the conventional regimen of SAG, cardiac toxicity has been reported in 8% to 17% of cases with 5% to 7% of them having fatal toxicity. Cardiac toxicity is uncommon with amphotericin B with only few isolated reports. We report some patients with kala-azar in whom coadministration of SAG and amphotericin B led to arrhythmia and sudden death.
