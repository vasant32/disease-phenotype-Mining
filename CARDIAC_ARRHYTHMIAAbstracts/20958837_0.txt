We report a case of an 18-year-old female who presented with respiratory failure secondary to H1N1 infection, and who subsequently developed high-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. The conduction abnormalities persisted over 2 weeks following complete resolution of respiratory symptoms. A permanent pacemaker was implanted for safety and subsequent pacemaker follow-up suggested reversibility of the conduction abnormality. This case highlights the potential impact of the H1N1 influenza virus on the cardiac conduction system.
