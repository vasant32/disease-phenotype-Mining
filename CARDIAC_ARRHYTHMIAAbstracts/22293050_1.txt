 INTRODUCTION: The aim was to illustrate current use of temporary pacing (TP) in Denmark by replicating a questionnaire study from 1986 and to compare the results of the two studies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The questionnaire was sent to Danish hospitals treating patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). To illustrate potential changes in the indications for TP, the questionnaire included two case reports also used in 1986. RESULTS: Thirty-three of 39 hospitals returned the questionnaire. Thirty-one (94%) were able to perform transcutaneous TP, and 20 (61%) had access to transvenous TP. Transcutaneous TP was preferred in five hospitals, and transvenous TP was the procedure of choice in 15. In 1986, 13 of 74 (18%) hospitals were able to perform transcutaneous TP, and 33 of 74 (45%) had access to transvenous TP. Over the two decades, the proportion of patients with AMI undergoing TP decreased from 3.7% to 0.7% (p < 0.00001). No significant difference was found with regard to the indications for TP except for patients with posterior AMI complicated with a third degree atrioventricular block in whom a higher rate of TP was found (85%) compared with the 1986 results (56%) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The proportion of hospitals with TP facilities has nearly doubled since 1986. Over the same time period, the number of Danes undergoing TP in association with AMI was reduced. At present, TP is being performed in less than 1% of AMI patients. FUNDING: Not relevant. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not relevant.
