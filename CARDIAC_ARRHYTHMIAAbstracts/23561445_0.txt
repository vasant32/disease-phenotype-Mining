AIM: Cardiac rhythm alterations are a frequent cause of hospital admission. However, we do not know their characteristics and economic costs. We have analyzed the epidemiology and cost of hospitalizations due to cardiac arrhythmias in the National Health System. METHODS: The characteristics and costs were reviewed in patients admitted with a principal diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia (1997-2010;diagnosis related groups [DRG] -138 and 139 of the National Health System minimum data base set). Atrial fibrillation/flutter accounted for 65% of these DRGs. The secondary diagnoses prevalent in such DRGs were also reviewed. RESULTS: Hospitalizations due to cardiac arrhythmias were approximately 26.000 per year and close to 1.6% for mortality. In 2010 there were 26.421 hospitalizations with an estimated cost of 65 million Euros. Frequent comorbidities were recorded, such as hypertension (43%), heart failure (12%) or diabetes mellitus (20%). A total of 43% were admitted to cardiology and 36% to internal medicine. CONCLUSIONS: During the period 1997-2010, there was a significant annual number of hospitalizations for cardiac arrhythmias (mainly atrial fibrillation), with measurable costs, in Spain. More than one third were attended by internists.
