 UNLABELLED: Nowadays, radiofrequency ablation (RF) is recommended treatment method of atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia associated with accessory pathway. This procedure is characterised by high early and late efficacy and low risk of complication. The aim of this study was to evaluate early effectiveness and late arrhythmia recurrences subjectively experienced by the patient after RF ablation of accessory pathway in Wolf-Parkinson-White Syndrome, depending on it's localization and the electrical parameters of ablation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy two patient in age 13-79 (35 +/- 15,3) who had RF ablation of accessory pathway preformed were included in this study. Localization of the pathway, electrical parameters of ablation and early effectiveness of the procedure was assessed retrospectively. Group of patients who had successful ablation (n = 57) were asked about recurrence of heart palpitation after minimum 6 months from the procedure and further. Additionally, information about comorbidities and medication used by patients was collected. RESULTS: Septal localization of accessory pathway was most frequent (59,7%) in study group (n = 72). Early effectiveness was achieved in 80% of patient. Electrical ablation parameters were similar in a group with successful (n = 57) and unsuccessful procedure (n = 15) with exception of numbers of RF application (14 vs 30). In a late observation, 59,09% of the patients did not experienced recurrence of heart palpitation. CONCLUSIONS: In accessory pathway with difficult anatomy access, increased number of RF application do not increase procedure effectiveness. Subjective late effect of the ablation reported by the patient is lower than after electrophysiological study verification. Lack of correlation between pathway localization and early effectiveness of the ablation or late recurrence of heart palpitation reported by the patient.
