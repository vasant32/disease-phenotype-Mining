 BACKGROUND: Left ventricular aneurysm (LVA) is one of the serious complications after acute myocardial infarction. We attempted to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of LVA repair combined with epicardial radiofrequency ablation for ventricular arrhythmia during off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB). METHODS: From June 2009 to April 2011, 31 patients with LVA had angina symptoms and ventricular arrhythmia. In all patients, circular and cross-shaped radiofrequency epicardial ablations were performed using unipolar ablation pen along the border between the aneurysm wall and normal cardiac tissue and in the central zone of the aneurysms, followed by a linear placation of ventricular aneurysms on beating heart. RESULTS: All the patients showed complete recovery. The average number of grafted vessels was 2.7 Â± 1.3. Intraoperative examinations revealed that the ventricular arrhythmia was effectively controlled by radiofrequency ablation. All cases had been followed up for one year. Holter monitoring revealed a significant reduction in ventricular arrhythmias (P < 0.05). Echocardiography showed significant increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.05) and decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: For patients with ventricular aneurysm and preoperative malignant arrhythmia, aneurysm repair plus epicardial radiofrequency ablation in OPCAB was found to be an effective and feasible therapeutic technique. However, medium- to long-term therapeutic efficacy of this method remains to be determined by future studies and observations.
