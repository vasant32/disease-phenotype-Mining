Carbon monoxide (CO) is a well-known chemical asphyxiant, which causes tissue hypoxia with prominent neurological and cardiovascular injury. After exposure to CO, several cardiac manifestations have been reported, including arrhythmias, acute myocardial infarction, and pulmonary edema. However, an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) due to CO poisoning is a very rare presentation, and the treatment for STEMI due to CO poisoning is not well established. Here, we report a rare case of STEMI complicated by increased thrombogenicity secondary to acute CO poisoning and complete revascularization after antithrombotic treatment.
