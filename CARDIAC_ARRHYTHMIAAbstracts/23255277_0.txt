 BACKGROUND: Percutaneous left ventricular assist devices (pLVADs) are increasingly being used to facilitate ablation of unstable ventricular tachycardia (VT), but the safety profile and hemodynamic benefits of these devices have not been described in a systematic, prospective manner. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty patients with scar VT underwent ablation with a pLVAD. Neuromonitoring using cerebral oximetry was performed to evaluate a cerebral desaturation threshold to guide the duration of activation/entrainment mapping. The efficacy of pLVAD support was tested in a controlled manner with simulated VT. Complete procedural success was achieved in 50% (n=8) of patients, who were initially inducible for sustained VT, and partial procedural success in 37% (n=6). Using a cerebral desaturation level of 55% as a lower safety limit to guide the duration of sustained VT, 3 patients (15%) developed mild acute kidney injury (all resolved), and 1 (5%) patient developed mild cognitive dysfunction. During fast simulated VT (300 ms), cerebral desaturation to â‰¤55% occurred in more than half (53%) of patients tested without pLVAD support, compared with only 5% with full pLVAD support (P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: In a consecutive series of patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, pLVAD-supported scar VT ablation was safe and feasible. During fast simulated VT, a miniaturized axial flow pump imparted a more favorable hemodynamic profile compared with pharmacological agents alone. Cerebral oximetry is a complimentary monitoring modality during scar VT ablation, and avoidance of cerebral desaturations below a threshold of 55% may safely guide the duration of mapping during unstable VT.
