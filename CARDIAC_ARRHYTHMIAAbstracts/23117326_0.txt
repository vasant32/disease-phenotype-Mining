Myocardial bridge (MB) is defined as compression of coronary artery during systole while it is normal in diastole. In angiographic series, the prevalence of this anomaly was reported between 0.5% and 2.5%. It is occasionally seen in the middle segment of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Although MB is considered to be a benign anomaly, the association of MB with ischemia, systolic dysfunction, conduction abnormality, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death were reported. Herein, we report 3 cases of MB that were diagnosed with coronary angiography and were associated with arrhythmic complications. In 2 patients, complete atrioventricular block was present, and another patient was diagnosed with sick sinus syndrome with the help of an electrophysiological study. All patients underwent permanent cardiac pacemaker implantation.
