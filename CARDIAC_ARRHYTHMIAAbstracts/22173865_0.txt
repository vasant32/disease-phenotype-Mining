 PURPOSE: Sleep apnea (SA) has been associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) and has been found to be a predictor of AF recurrence after successful pulmonary vein isolation. No investigations have been carried out to determine the prevalence of SA in patients with typical atrial flutter (AFL) and the impact of SA on AFL recurrence after AFL ablation. Our aim is to determine if SA is a predictor of recurrence of AFL and/or atrial arrhythmias in patients who have undergone AFL ablation. METHODS: This study used a retrospective electronic chart review analysis of consecutive right-sided isthmus-dependent AFL referred for ablation over a 2-year period. Recurrent atrial arrhythmias were classified as AFL, AF, or other arrhythmias. SA prevalence was determined. RESULTS: We included 122 consecutive patients undergoing AFL ablation between January 2008 and December 2009. Mean follow-up was 28.3 ± 6.4 months. Males were 75.4%, had a mean age of 68.3 ± 10.4 years, hypertension 65%, and structural heart disease 42%. Prevalence of SA was 27%. Recurrence of AFL was observed in 9.8%, recurrence of AF was observed in 22.1%, and other arrhythmias 4.9%. SA was not a predictor of AFL recurrence (6.1% vs. 11.2%; p = 0.39). SA was neither a predictor of AF nor of other arrhythmia recurrences. Variables associated with AFL recurrence were: no history of preablation antiarrhythmic drugs (18.8% vs. 6.7%; p = 0.04) and lower BMI (27.07 kg/m(2) vs. 30.87 kg/m(2); p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of SA in patients with AFL was 27%. SA was not found to be a predictor of AFL recurrence after successful AFL ablation.
