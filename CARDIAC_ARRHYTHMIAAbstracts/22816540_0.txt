 BACKGROUND: Abnormalities in repolarization may reflect underlying myocardial pathology and play a prominent role in arrhythmogenesis The T-wave amplitude has been associated with cardiovascular outcome in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) Additionally, T-wave amplitude is considered a predictor of arrhythmias, as well as being related to an individual's inflammatory status. The combined influence of different variables, such as inflammation, cardiovascular risk factors and physical fitness status, on the T-wave amplitude has not been evaluated to date. The aim of this study was to identify factors that affect the T-wave amplitude. METHODS: Data from 255 consecutive apparently healthy individuals included in the Tel Aviv Medical Center Inflammation Survey (TAMCIS) were reviewed. All patients had undergone a physical examination and an exercise stress test, and different inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers (fibrinogen, potassium, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) were measured. RESULTS: Multivariate stepwise analysis revealed that the body mass index and the resting heart rate were significantly associated with the T-wave amplitude (β=-0.34, P < 0.001; β=-0.19, P = 0.03, respectively) in males, while the recovery rate and the usage of statins significantly affected the T-wave amplitude in females (β= 0.36, P = 0.002; β= 0.35, P = 0.002, respectively). Inflammatory variables had no significant affect on the T-wave amplitude of either gender. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the T-wave amplitude is linked to an individual's physical fitness and not to his/her inflammatory status.
