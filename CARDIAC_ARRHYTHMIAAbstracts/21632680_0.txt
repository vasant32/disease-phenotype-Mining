 OBJECTIVE: Cardiac involvement means a poor prognosis in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Conduction defects and arrhythmias are frequent in patients with SSc, and may result in sudden cardiac death. We tested whether electrophysiologic studies and implantation of cardioverter defibrillators are recommended when ventricular arrhythmias are present. METHOD: A cardioverter defibrillator was implanted in 10 patients with SSc who had heart involvement. RESULT: After 36 months, analysis of the device showed several episodes of ventricular tachycardia in 3 patients, which were promptly reverted by electrical shock delivery. CONCLUSION: In patients with SSc who are affected by ventricular arrhythmias, the implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator may prevent sudden cardiac death.
