 AIMS: Femoral venous access may be limited in certain patients undergoing electrophysiology (EP) study and ablation. The purpose of this study is to review a series of patients undergoing percutaneous transhepatic access to allow for ablation of cardiac arrhythmias. METHODS AND RESULTS: Six patients with a variety of cardiac arrhythmias and venous abnormalities underwent percutaneous transhepatic access. Under fluoroscopic and ultrasound guidance, a percutaneous needle was advanced into a hepatic vein and exchanged for a vascular sheath over a wire. Electrophysiology study and radiofrequency ablation was then performed. All tachycardias, including atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, atrioventricular nodal tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation, were ablated. Procedural times ranged from 227 to 418 min. Fluoroscopy times ranged from 32 to 95 min. There were no complications. All six patients have been arrhythmia-free in follow-up (5-49 months, mean 23.1 months). CONCLUSION: Percutaneous transhepatic access is safe and feasible in patients with limited venous access who are undergoing EP study and ablation for a range of cardiac arrhythmias.
