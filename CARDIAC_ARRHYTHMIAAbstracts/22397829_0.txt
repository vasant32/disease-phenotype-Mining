Cardiovascular events are amongst the most frequent comorbidities associated with chronic pulmonary obstructe disease (COPD). It is believed that smoking is the main risk factor shared by both diseases. However, there are other determining factors, such as the inflammatory system, oxidative stress, hpoxaemia, endotheleal dysfunction, and age itself, that could also be common aetio-pathogenic mechanisms. Cardiovascular disease includes a wide spectrum of diseases, including, coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, and right ventricular function. These processes can complicate the clinical course of patients with COPD and have a clear effect on their survival. It has been shown, from a therapeutic point of view, that the combined treatment of COPD and cardiovascular diseases could lead to an improvement in the morbidity and mortality in patients with both diseases. However, given that there is still insufficient evidence, its use in patients with COPD can only be recommended when there is an indication for its use, in accordance with the current clinical practice guidelines.
