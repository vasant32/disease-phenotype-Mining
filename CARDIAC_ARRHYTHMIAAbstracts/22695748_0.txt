The case report of a 14-month-old Thoroughbred filly with acute onset of severe right hindlimb lameness is presented. The horse had a severe and sudden abduction of the hindlimbs due to a side effect of an overdose of lidocaine, which had been administered in a constant rate infusion after a colic surgery. Transcutaneous ultrasonography and standing radiography of the pelvis revealed proximal and cranial displacement of the greater trochanter and free bone fragments consistent with an apophyseal avulsion fracture of the greater trochanter. The complete diagnosis was obtained with the horse in a standing position. The filly was euthanatized because of deterioration resulting from the colic condition and of the poor prognosis of the fracture of the greater trochanter. Postmortem evaluation confirmed an apophyseal avulsion fracture of the right greater trochanter. To the authors' knowledge, ultrasonographic and radiographic findings of this fracture have not been described in the standing horse. The diagnosis was reached quite easily with the horse in a normal standing position when the characteristic ultrasonographic and radiographic findings were detected.
