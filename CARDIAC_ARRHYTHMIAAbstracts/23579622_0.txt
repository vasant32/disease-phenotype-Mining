BACKGROUND: In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the degree of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) could influence the development of ventricular arrhythmias. OBJECTIVE: In HCM, analyze the association between the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias determined by Holter electrocardiogram (ECG-Holter) and the degree of LVH determined by maximum wall thickness (MWT) in echocardiography and body mass index (BMI). METHODS: Fifty-four consecutive patients with HCM underwent 24-hour ECG-Holter and echocardiography for assessment of level of LVH through MWT and BMI. Two levels were established for the occurrence of Ventricular Arrhythmias: I - alone or paired extrasystoles and II - Non- Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia (NSVT). RESULTS: In 13 patients (24%) with NSVT (level II), there was a higher frequency of MWT of the left ventricle (LV) > 21 mm (n = 10, 77%, 25 ± 4 mm) and LLLV = 144 g/m² (n = 10, 77%, 200 ± 30 g/m²), in comparison with those presenting with extrasystole arrhythmias (level I) (n = 41, 76%), in which these measures were identified in, respectively, 37 % (n= 15, 23 ± 1 mm), p = 0.023, and 39% (n = 16, 192 ± 53 g / m²) of the cases (p = 0.026). The cut-off values mentioned were determined by the ROC curve with a confidence interval of 95%. NSVT was more common in patients with MWTLV > 21 mm and LLLV > 144 g/m² (8 of 13, 62%) than in those with (4 of 13, 31%) or without (1 of 13; 8%) echocardiographic variables above cut-off values (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: In HCM, occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias by Holter was associated with the degree of LVH assessed by echocardiography through MWT and BMI.
