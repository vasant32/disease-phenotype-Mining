We report the case of a 70-year-old patient presenting with palpitations who was found to have recurrent inappropriate rate drop responses on interrogation of his pacemaker. These were found to be triggered by interpolated premature ventricular complexes (PVCs). We discuss the drop detect algorithm and how interpolated PVCs triggered the rate drop response.
