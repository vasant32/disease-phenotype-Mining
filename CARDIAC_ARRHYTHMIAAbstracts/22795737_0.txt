 BACKGROUND: RF ablation for cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) dependent flutter is an established therapy. Right atrial hypertrophy and enlargement are associated with the occurrence of cavotricuspid isthmus dependent flutter. Therefore, patients with pulmonary hypertension (PAH) are prone to atrial arrhythmias like cavotricuspid isthmus dependent flutter. However, the influence of PAH on typical atrial flutter ablation procedure has not been systematically examined. METHODS: In a retrospective single-centre analysis data of patients undergoing an ablation procedure for cavotricuspid isthmus dependent flutter between January 2007 and October 2009 at Hannover Medical School, Germany were analysed. Only procedures performed by experienced electrophysiologists with an 8mm RF-ablation catheter were included. Data for 196 patients were analysed. Thirty-eight patients were identified with PAH and were compared to 158 patients without PAH for procedural ablation parameters, procedure time, ablation time, ablation points and fluoroscopy time. RESULTS: A bidirectional block of the CTI was achieved in all patients. Patients with severe PAH had a significantly longer procedure time (78±40 min vs. 62±29 min; p=0.033), total ablation time (20±11 min vs. 15±9 min; p=0.02) and more ablation lesions (26±16 vs. 19±12; p=0.018) as compared to patients without PAH. CONCLUSION: Cavotricuspid isthmus dependent flutter ablation in patients with PAH is associated with longer procedure duration and a greater amount of cumulative tissue ablation needed to achieve bidirectional block of the CTI compared to patients without pulmonary hypertension.
