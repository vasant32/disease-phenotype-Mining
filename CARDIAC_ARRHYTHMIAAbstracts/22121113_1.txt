 BACKGROUND: Management of elderly patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is not standardized and physicians discretion for invasive versus conservative strategies lacks sufficient evidence. The purpose of this analysis was, therefore, to evaluate treatment strategies and outcomes of elderly patients with ACS and to highlight reasons for the treatment decision in a consecutive series of elderly patients. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of 1,001 elderly patients (>75 years) presenting with ACS. Patients were identified on the basis of their final discharge diagnosis. Baseline data, past medical history, cardiac and noncardiac concomitant diseases, treatment strategy, and adverse outcomes were evaluated, using patient's charts. Various co-variates were used to determine the association or predictive value of these co-variates to the invasive versus conservative management of the subjects. Thirty-day mortality and long-term survival were assessed either directly or in discharged patients via telephone interview with the patients, the patients' relatives or the primary care physicians. RESULTS: A total of 776 (77.5%) patients were treated invasively and 225 (22.5%) conservatively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that patients with advanced age, Killip class > II, pre-existing coronary artery disease, prior stroke, pre-existing renal failure, obesity, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, prior ACS, and the presence of supraventricular arrhythmias were significantly more likely to undergo conservative treatment. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in conservatively treated patients (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this retrospective analysis, we identified age as the main predictor for a conservative treatment strategy in elderly patients, albeit an invasive strategy was associated with a significantly better outcome.
