Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative with predominantly class III anti-arrhythmic effects, is used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. The purpose of this study was to assess the potential of neferine, an effective anti-pulmonary fibrosis drug isolated from the embryo of Nelumbo nucifera Gaertner's seeds, to alter the pharmacokinetic profile of amiodarone. Experimental Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups. In groups 1 and 2, amiodarone was given to rats by intragastric and intravenous administration, respectively, while neferine was co-administratered by intragastric administration. Blood samples were collected from the orbital venous plexus at indicated time points and were analyzed for amiodarone concentration using RP-HPLC. The geometric mean ratio for C(max) and AUC(0-96) was calculated. There were no significant differences between the pharmacokinetics parameters of amiodarone administered intravenously or intragastrically and the control (without neferine) group (with ratios of 0.7-1.4 in all experimental groups), suggesting that neferine had no effect on amiodarone plasma pharmacokinetics. The dosage regimen of amiodarone does not need to be taken into consideration when combined with neferine.
