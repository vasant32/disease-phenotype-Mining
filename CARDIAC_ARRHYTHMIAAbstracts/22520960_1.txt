 OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to evaluate the nature and onset of changes in the QRS complex in the offspring of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS). METHODS AND METHODS: A total of 529 subjects, divided into 5 groups, were included in the study: (i) group DM (n = 92), patients with DM; (ii) group MetS (n = 125), patients with MetS; (iii) group O-DM (n = 109), offspring of patients with DM; (iv) group O-MetS (n = 122), offspring of patients with MetS; and (v) group HO (n = 81), offspring of healthy subjects. QRS parameters analyzed included amplitude, maximum QRS spatial vector magnitude, electrical axis (EA), and 3 electrocardiogram (ECG) criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy based on amplitude criteria: Sokolow-Lyon index, Cornell voltage, and Gubner criterion. RESULTS: Patients with DM and MetS showed a significant leftward shift of the EA when compared with the control group. A modest but significant leftward shift of EA was also observed in both offspring groups. These EA and maximum QRS spatial vector magnitude changes were reflected in the individual leads of the 12-lead ECG. The prevalence of a positive diagnosis by accepted electrocardiographic criteria (ECG left ventricular hypertrophy) was low. CONCLUSION: Patients with DM and MetS displayed significant changes in QRS complex that suggest depolarization sequence deterioration. Similar changes were observed also in the offspring of patients with DM and MetS, which suggests early subclinical cardiovascular damage. These findings have implications for prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment in the offspring of patients with DM and MetS.
