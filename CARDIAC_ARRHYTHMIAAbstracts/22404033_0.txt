Dynamic electrocardiography (DCG) or Holter is the best device to detect arrhythmia and can help early detection of some sudden cardiac death risk factors. The acquisition and recording system of the DCG, however, affects the data quality and the patients' comfort directly. This paper reviews the related latest studies, and discusses the importance of new ECG electrode and wireless dynamic monitoring in DCG monitoring field. Moreover, the existed main problems are summarized and classified and the prospects for the development trend are presented.
