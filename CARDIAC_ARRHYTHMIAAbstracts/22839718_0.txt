We have studied the role of oxidant stress in development of rhythm disturbances in early postoperative period after coronary artery bypass grafting and possibilities of their prevention with preparations of ascorbinic acid. It was shown that the use of Î²-adrenoblockers allows to prevent arrhythmia on first day after operation only in 80% of cases. Patients with developed disturbances of cardiac rhythm were characterized by high parameters of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and substantial changes of activity of antioxidant enzyme catalase. Administration of ascorbinic acid at the stage of preparation of patients to surgery and in first 24 hours after operation allowed to effectively prevent development of oxidative stress and disturbances of cardiac rhythm. A conclusion was made that inclusion of ascorbinic acid in drug therapy of patients with ischemic heart disease could be recommended for prevention of arrhythmia in postoperative period.
