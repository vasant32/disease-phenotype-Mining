Cardiac magnetic resonance with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) is a well-established method for in vivo detection of myocardial scarring. Several recent studies have investigated the prognostic value of LGE in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC). We discuss the prevalence and patterns of scarring in HC and its pathophysiologic significance, with focus on ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. The available evidence that myocardial scar demonstrated by LGE is a good independent predictor of cardiac mortality in HC is summed up. Recommendations of current guidelines for prevention of sudden cardiac death in HC are discussed with regard to recent results, and the significance of LGE as an emerging risk factor is pointed out. In conclusion, it is demonstrated that LGE has incremental value in addition to clinical risk factors for risk stratification and management of patients with HC.
