We report the case of a child with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, who had inappropriate electric shocks by an implantable cardioverter defibrillator and from recurrence of arrhythmias despite an appropriate Î²-blocking treatment. An additional treatment by flecainide completely suppressed inappropriate shocks due to sinusal tachycardia and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. We briefly discuss the potentially interesting effect of flecainide in this specific arrhythmia.
