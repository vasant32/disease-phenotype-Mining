BACKGROUND: -Routine clinical use of novel free-breathing, motion-corrected, averaged late gadolinium enhancement (moco-LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance may have advantages over conventional breath held LGE (bh-LGE) especially in vulnerable patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: -In 390 consecutive patients, we collected bh-LGE and moco-LGE with identical image matrix parameters. In 41 patients, bh-LGE was abandoned due to image quality issues, including 10 with myocardial infarction (MI). When both were acquired, MI detection was similar (McNemar test, p=0.4) with high agreement (kappa statistic 0.95). With artifact-free bh-LGE images, pixelwise MI measures correlated highly (R(2)=0.96) without bias. Moco-LGE was faster, and image quality and diagnostic confidence were higher on blinded review (p<0.001 for all). Over a median of 1.2 years, 20 heart failure hospitalizations and 18 deaths occurred. For bh-LGE, but not moco-LGE, inferior image quality and bh-LGE non acquisition were linked to patient vulnerability confirmed by adverse outcomes (logrank p<0.001). Moco-LGE significantly stratified risk on the full cohort (logrank p<0.001), but bh-LGE did not (logrank p=0.056) since a significant number of vulnerable patients did not receive bh-LGE (due to arrhythmia or inability to breath hold). CONCLUSIONS: -MI detection and quantification are similar between moco-LGE and bh-LGE when bh-LGE can be acquired well, but bh-LGE quality deteriorates with patient vulnerability. Acquisition time, image quality, diagnostic confidence and the number of successfully scanned patients are superior with moco-LGE which extends LGE-based risk stratification to include patients with vulnerability confirmed by outcomes. Moco-LGE may be suitable for routine clinical use.
