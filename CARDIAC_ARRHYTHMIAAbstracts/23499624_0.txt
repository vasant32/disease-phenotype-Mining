BACKGROUND: Persistent atrial fibrillation (PAF) results in electromechanical and structural remodeling by mechanisms that are poorly understood. Myofibroblast proliferation and fibrosis is a major source of structural remodeling in PAF. Myofibroblasts also interact with atrial myocytes via direct physical contact and release of signaling molecules that may contribute to remodeling. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether myofibroblasts contribute to atrial myocyte electromechanical remodeling via direct physical contact and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling. METHODS AND RESULTS: Myofibroblasts and myocytes from adult sheep atria were co-cultured for 24 hours. Myocytes making contact with myofibroblasts demonstrated significant reduction (p≤0.05) in L-type calcium (ICa,L) peak current density, shortening of action potential duration (APD)and reduction in calcium transients. These effects were blocked by pre-treatment with neutralizing PDGF-AB antibody (N-ab). Heterocellular contact also severely disturbed the localization of the L-type calcium channel. Exposure of adult sheep atrial myocytes to 1ng/ml recombinant PDGF-AB peptide for 24 hours reduced both APD50 and APD80 (p≤0.05). Peak ICa,L was reduced as well. Pretreatment with N-ab prevented these effects. Finally, while control atrial myocytes did not respond 1:1 to pacing frequencies >3 Hz, atrial myocytes from hearts that were tachypaced for 2 months and normal myocytes treated with PDGF-AB for 24 hrs could be paced at 10 Hz. CONCLUSION: In addition to leading to fibrosis, atrial myofibroblasts contribute to electromechanical remodeling of myocytes via direct physical contact and release of PDGF-AB, which may be a factor in PAF induced remodeling.
