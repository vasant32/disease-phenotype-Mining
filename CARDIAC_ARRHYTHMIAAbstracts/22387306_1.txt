 BACKGROUND: Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is an autosomic dominant disease with a high rate of conduction disorders and increased risk of sudden death. Prophylactic cardiac pacing may be considered in asymptomatic patients with FAP. However, the potential benefits are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To document conduction disorders in a large series of FAP and the incidence of high-degree atrioventricular (AV) block in patients with prophylactic pacemaker (PM). METHODS: From January 1999 to January 2010, 262 patients with FAP were retrospectively evaluated. Prophylactic PM was implanted in patients with His-ventricular interval ≥ 70 ms, His-ventricular interval >55 ms associated with a fascicular block, a first-degree AV block, or a Wenckebach anterograde point ≤ 100 beats/min. The spontaneous AV conduction was then analyzed by temporarily inhibiting the PM. RESULTS: As compared with patients with prophylactic PM (n = 100) and patients implanted given a class I/IIa indication (n = 18), the patients who did not require PM (n = 144) were younger and displayed less severe cardiac involvement. Follow-up after prophylactic PM implantation was analyzed in 95 of the 100 patients over 45 ± 35 months, and a high-degree AV block was documented in 24 of the 95 patients (25%). The risk of high-degree AV block was higher in patients with first-degree AV block or Wenckebach anterograde point ≤ 100 beats/min (hazard ratio 3.5; 95% confidence interval 1.2-10) while microvoltage on surface electrocardiogram reduced the risk (hazard ratio 0.2; 95% confidence interval 0.1-0.7). CONCLUSION: In FAP with conduction disorders, prophylactic PM implantation prevented major cardiac events in 25% of the patients over a 45-month mean follow-up. It is suggested that prophylactic PM implantation prevented symptomatic bradycardia in these patients.
