Purpose: Autonomic dysfunction including sympathetic activation and vagal withdrawal has been reported in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). We tested the hypotheses that high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) in CHF patients would enhance vagal modulation and thus decrease arrhythmic events.Methods: Eighteen CHF patients underwent a baseline assessment (CON) and were then randomized to a single session of HIIE and to an isocaloric moderate-intensity continuous exercise (MICE). We evaluated heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV) parameters, and arrhythmic events by 24h Holter-ECG recordings after HIIE, MICE and CON sessions.Results: We found that HR was significantly decreased after HIIE (68±3 bpm, p<0.01) when compared to CON and MICE values (respectively 71.1±2 and 69± 3 bpm). HIIE led to a significant increase in normalized HF power (35.95 ± 2.83% Vs 31.56 ± 1.93 and 24.61 ± 2.62% for CON and MICE respectively, p<0.01). Both exercise conditions were associated with an increase in VLF power comparatively to CON. After HIIE, premature ventricular contractions (PVC) were significantly decreased (531 ± 338 Vs 1007 ± 693 and 1671 ± 1604 for CON and MICE respectively, p<0.01). An association was found between the changes in PVC and the changes in LF/HF ratio (r=0.66; p<0.01) in patients exposed to HIIE.Conclusion: We demonstrate that a single session of HIIE improves autonomic profile of CHF patients leading to significant reductions of HR and arrhythmic events in a 24h post-training period. Cardioprotective effects of HIEE in CHF patients need to be confirmed in a larger study population and on a long-term basis.
