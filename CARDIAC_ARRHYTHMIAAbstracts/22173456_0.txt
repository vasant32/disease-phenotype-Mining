Dronedarone (Multaq-Sanofi), an analog of amiodarone, was approved by the FDA in 2009 for oral treatment of paroxysmal or persistent (non-permanent) atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Amiodarone (Cordarone, and others) is more effective for this indication, but its use is often limited by its adverse effects, including thyroid and pulmonary toxicity.
