 BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common serious cardiac arrhythmia, and its prevalence is expected to increase. There is lack of data about patient characteristics, practice patterns, and outcomes of AF in the Arab Middle East. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Gulf Survey of Atrial Fibrillation Events (Gulf SAFE) is a prospective, observational registry of patients with AF with a 12-month follow-up. The registry was emergency room based. Between October 2009 and June 2010, 2043 consecutive patients with AF were enrolled from 23 hospitals in 6 Middle Eastern Gulf countries. Data were collected on a standardized case report form and entered online. Data collected included patient demographics, medical history, type of AF, treatment, and outcome of emergency room visit. If patients were admitted, details of their treatment, investigations, and outcomes during hospital stay were collected. Completion of 12-month follow-up is expected by July 2011. The mean age was 57 years, and 52% were men. The most common concomitant condition was hypertension, present in 1072 (52%) patients. At enrollment, 28% of patients had a history of coronary artery disease, 30% had diabetes, and 16% had rheumatic valve disease. History of stroke and transient ischemic attacks were reported in 9% and 4% of patients, respectively. The most common type of AF, first attack AF, occurred in 37%, whereas 19% of patients had lone AF. CONCLUSIONS: Gulf SAFE will provide valuable insights into AF management and outcomes in the Gulf region of the Middle East.
