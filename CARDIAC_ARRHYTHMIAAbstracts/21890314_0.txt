The coexistence of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia is defined as metabolic syndrome. Studies show substantial cardiovascular risks among these patients. The risk of patients with metabolic syndrome undergoing total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is unknown. Patients with and without metabolic syndrome undergoing TJA during a 3-year period were analyzed for postoperative complications. Metabolic syndrome was defined by having 3 of the following 4 criteria: obesity (body mass index â‰¥30 kg/m(2)), dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes. Patients with metabolic syndrome had a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular complications compared with controls (P = .017). The risk of an adverse event increased by 29% and 32%, respectively, when there were 3 or 4 syndrome components. Patients with metabolic syndrome undergoing TJA have increased risk for cardiovascular complications. Our results show that metabolic syndrome may have a clustering effect and pose increased risk when individual risks factors are combined.
