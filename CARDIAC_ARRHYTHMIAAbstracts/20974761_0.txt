A case of idiopathic premature ventricular contractions successfully ablated from the epicardial right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) via the subxiphoid pericardial approach was described. The sites with earliest endocardial and epicardial ventricular activation were located adjacent to each other in the RVOT and at both sites, double potentials were recorded. Coronary angiography was helpful for identifying the ablation site.
