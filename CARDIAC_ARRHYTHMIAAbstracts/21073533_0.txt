 BACKGROUND: Maintenance of an open sternotomy (OS) after a complicated cardiac operation is an adjunct in the treatment of the severely impaired heart. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the incidence, survival, and predictors of poor outcome for open chest management (OCM) with delayed sternal closure (DSC) at our department. METHODS: Prolonged open chest (OC) was used in 179 of 5122 cardiac surgery patients between 2004 and 2008 (3.5%). We wanted to determine indications, mortality, postoperative complications, and predictors of outcome. RESULTS: The incidence of OS was 3.5%, with 1.3% for isolated CABG, 2.4% for isolated valve, and 6.4% for combined procedures. Indications for OS were: hemodynamic compromise (110), intractable bleeding (19), arrhythmia (14), and cardiac edema or tamponade (36). 127 of the 179 patients with DSC (71%) survived. 52 patients died: 20 before DSC and 32 after this procedure. Mortality could be related to the indication for OS: With the indication "low cardiac output syndrome" (LCOS) the mortality was 34.5%, for bleeding it was 26.3%, for arrhythmias, 21.4%, and for tamponade on closure it was 16.7%. After DSC, deep sternal wound infection occurred in nine patients (5%), superficial infection in 4.7% of patients. There were 16 patients with postoperative stroke (8.9%) and 24 patients with need for dialysis (13.4%). Predictors of mortality by univariate analysis were VAD insertion, new onset of hemodialysis, reoperation for bleeding, mean length of duration of OS (survivors 3.4 days, nonsurvivors 6.5 days), and longer duration of high-dose inotropic therapy. CONCLUSION: This study shows that OCM with DSC is a beneficial, therapeutic option in patients with postoperative LCOS, significant hemorrhage or intractable arrhythmias. However, patients with reoperation for bleeding, need for VAD, and particularly a prolonged delay before sternal closure continued to have a poor outcome.â€‚
