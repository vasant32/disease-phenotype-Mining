BACKGROUND: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) is associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Risk stratification of ARVC/D patients, however, remains an unresolved issue. In this study we investigated whether heart rate variability (HRV) can be helpful in identifying ARVC/D patients with increased risk of arrhythmic events. METHODS AND RESULts: We studied 30 consecutive patients (17 males; 45.4 ± 18 years) with ARVC/D, diagnosed according to guideline criteria; 15 patients (50%) had received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for primary SCD prevention. HRV was assessed on 24-h ECG Holter monitoring. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of major arrhythmic events (SCD, sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), ICD therapy for sustained VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF)). During the follow-up period (19 ± 7 months), no deaths occurred, but 5 patients (17%) experienced arrhythmic events (4 VTs and 1 VF, all in the ICD group). All HRV parameters were significantly lower in patients with, compared with those without, arrhythmic events. Low-frequency amplitude was the most significant HRV variable associated with arrhythmic events in univariate Cox regression analysis (P=0.017), and was the only significant predictor of arrhythmic events in multivariable regression analysis (hazard ratio 0.88, P=0.047), together with unexplained syncope (hazard ratio 16.1, P=0.039). CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that among ARVC/D patients HRV analysis might be helpful in identifying those with increased risk of major arrhythmic events.
