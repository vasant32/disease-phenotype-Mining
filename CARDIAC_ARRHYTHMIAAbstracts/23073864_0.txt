Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice. Its prevalence is rising due to an increasing elderly population and the improvement in management of life-threatening diseases such as myocardial infarction and heart failure. Over the past few years effective non-pharmacological treatments, new antiarrhythmics drugs, and anticoagulants have been introduced. Regardless of rate-control or rhythm control strategy, adequate stroke prevention still remains a cornerstone in the treatment of this arrhythmia. This review aims to illustrate the main practical issues in the management of atrial fibrillation, focusing on patients with recent-onset and hemodynamically stable atrial fibrillation.
