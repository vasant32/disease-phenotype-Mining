 OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF) with fragmented QRS complex (f-QRS) and J wave in resting electrocardiogram. METHODS: We reviewed data from 21 case subjects in our hospital who were resuscitated after cardiac arrest due to IVF and assessed the prevalence of f-QRS and J wave in resting electrocardiogram (ECG). All the case subjects were classified among three groups based on the electrocardiographic morphology: group I, both f-QRS and J wave were observed (n = 6), group II, only J wave was observed (n = 9), group III, neither f-QRS nor J wave was observed (n = 6). Population characteristics, history of syncope or sudden cardiac arrest, incidence of ventricular fibrillation (VF), and circumstance of VF were evaluated among the three groups. RESULTS: The incidence of index events (syncope, survived cardiac arrest and VF episodes recorded in implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or pacemakers) was 13.4 ± 5.6 per-year in group I, 10.8 ± 3.9 per-year in group II, and 9.8 ± 4.2 per-year in group III. There were significant differences in incidences among the three groups, the most frequent index events were observed in group I. The hazard ratio for incidence was 3.2 (95%CI, 1.1-7.9; P = 0.01). The history and circumstance of the index events were different among the groups. In group I, all the index events occurred during sleep in early morning. In group II, four subjects suffered VF during strenuous physical activities or agitation state, two during sleep in early morning, three in usual activity. In group III, one subject suffered VF during sleep in early morning, one in agitation state, four in usual activity. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the IVF patients with the combined appearance of f-QRS and J wave in the resting ECG suffer an increased risk of VF, this subgroup of IVF patients has a unique clinical feature.
