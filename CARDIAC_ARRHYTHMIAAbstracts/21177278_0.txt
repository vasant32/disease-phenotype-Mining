The vein of Marshall (VOM) and related cardiac ganglia have been clearly implicated in atrial fibrillation. Electrophysiological procedures have targeted these sites of autonomic innervation. However, targeting the exact sites has proven technically challenging. Identifying the VOM and infusing stem cells may ablate related ganglia autonomic function and offer an innovative treatment for atrial fibrillation.
