A syncope evaluation should start by identifying potentially life-threatening causes, including valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and arrhythmias. Most patients who present with syncope, however, have the more benign vasovagal (reflex) syncope. A busy syncope practice often also sees patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension presenting with syncope or severe recurrent presyncope. Recognition of these potential confounders of syncope might be difficult without adequate knowledge of their presentation, and this can adversely affect optimal management. This article reviews the presentation of the vasovagal syncope confounder and the putative pathophysiology of orthostatic hypotension, and suggests options for nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management.
