 BACKGROUND: We previously performed a trial of intravenous landiolol hydrochloride during and after cardiac surgery (the PASCAL trial) and demonstrated a preventive effect on postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF). In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of increasing the dose and administration period of landiolol for prevention of postoperative AF, as well as the effect of oral bisoprolol in the early postoperative period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 105 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting were randomized to 3 groups: a group receiving intravenous landiolol perioperatively at 5 Î¼g/kg/min for 3 days (group L), a group receiving oral bisoprolol postoperatively together with landiolol (group LB), and a control group without beta-blocker therapy (group C). The primary end point was the presence/absence of postoperative AF. Secondary end points were (1) the early clinical outcome, (2) hemodynamics, (3) cardiac enzymes (creatine kinase isoenzyme MB, troponin-I, and human heart fatty acid-binding protein), (4) high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and pentraxin-3, (5) asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), and (6) brain natriuretic peptide. RESULTS: Postoperative AF occurred in 14.5% of group L, 9.1% of group LB, and 35.3% of group C. A significant difference was observed between groups LB and C. Significantly higher levels of troponin-I, human heart fatty acid-binding protein, hs-CRP, pentraxin-3, and ADMA were noted in group C than in groups L and LB. CONCLUSIONS: Landiolol and bisoprolol prevented postoperative AF. The anti-ischemic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant effects of these beta-blockers presumably inhibited the onset of AF.
