 AIMS: Few data are available on cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) after coronary sinus (CS) lead extraction. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and mid-term outcome of transvenous CS lead reimplantation in a tertiary referral centre. METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled all patients who were referred to our hospital for CS lead removal from December 2000 through to May 2009 and were transvenously reimplanted with a CRT system before June 2009. One-year follow-up was performed to evaluate the incidence of infections, malfunctions, and mortality. We studied 113 consecutive patients undergoing successful CS lead extraction; 90 patients (75 male, mean age 69.2, range 35-84) underwent CS lead reimplantation (success rate: 95.6%; right-sided approach: 64.4%). In these patients, cardiac device infection was the usual indication for extraction (74.4%) and the subsequent reimplantation was performed after a median time of 3 days. The coronary sinus lead was usually positioned in the left ventricular (LV) postero-lateral region (62.2%); two procedures were required in two cases (2.2%). Balloon angioplasty was necessary for two patients (failure in one), whereas for the others we used a conventional implant technique. During follow-up, we observed four cases (4.4%) of local infection and six cases (6.7%) of system malfunction, requiring reintervention (two cases during the same hospitalization). One-year mortality was 5.5%. CONCLUSION: Left ventricular lead reimplantation is in our experience an effective and safe procedure, also in the case of right-sided approach. During follow-up, 1-year mortality was particularly low, whereas overall infection rate was higher than first implant procedures.
