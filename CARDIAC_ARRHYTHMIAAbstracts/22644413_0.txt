Cardiac fibromas are extremely rare in the general pediatric population and may present with a wide spectrum of clinical signs, including life-threatening arrhythmias and sudden death. We report a 14-month-old boy who presented with failure to thrive as the only symptom. Echocardiography showed a large cardiac fibroma in the right ventricle. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis. After complete surgical tumor resection, the boy showed normal catch-up growth. This case underlines the diversity of clinical features of cardiac tumors, which implies that they should be considered early in the differential diagnosis of infants with failure to thrive.
