We performed a survey on current atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation techniques used for catheter ablation of AF among the European Heart Rhythm Association Research Network. The focus of this questionnaire is on the ablation strategy, such as the use of different lesion sets or sites of ablation in the various forms of AF, and on the technical aspects of catheter ablation with respect to energy sources and imaging modalities.
