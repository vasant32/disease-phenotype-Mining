Interruption of inferior vena cava (IVC) with azygos continuation is a rare venous anomaly, and arrhythmogenic IVC is also rarely reported. Arrhythmogenicity of the hepatic segment of IVC in interruption of IVC has never been reported. We describe the case of a 37-year-old female with interrupted left IVC with azygos continuation to right superior vena cava and atrial tachycardia originating from the hepatic segment of IVC.
