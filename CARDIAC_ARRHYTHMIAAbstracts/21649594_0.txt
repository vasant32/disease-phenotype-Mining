Safe pharmacotherapy and prevention of arrhythmia is an urgent problem of modern cardiology. Essential micronutrients such as omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (-3 PUF-) significantly contribute to the metabolic processes in cardiomyocytes and cardiac conduction system. This article presents a systematic analysis of anti-arrhythmic effects of omega-3 PUFA and of standardized ethyl esters of omega-3 PUFA. The currently available data indicate two fundamentally different molecular mechanisms of anti-arrhythmic effects: "slow" and "fast" types. Formulation of fundamental prospects of bioinformatic studies of molecular effects of anti-arrhythmic action of omega-3 PUF-s is presented.
