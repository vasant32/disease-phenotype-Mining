 OBJECTIVES: To investigate incidence of perioperative cardiovascular events, to analyze related risk factors for the patients undergoing intraperitoneal surgery. METHODS: The data of 1079 patients who underwent intraperitoneal surgery (exclude laparoscope surgery) from July 2007 to June 2008 was reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS: For the patients undergoing intraperitoneal surgery, the incidence of major cardiovascular events was 3.99% (43/1079), all-cause mortality was 1.58% (17/1079). The independent risk factors of major cardiovascular events were age ≥ 60 years, history of coronary heart disease, cardiac insufficiency, arrhythmia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/(min·1.73 m(2)), emergency surgery and duration of surgery > 2.82 h (OR = 2.68 to 5.19, P = 0.001 to 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: The cardiac risk of intraperitoneal surgery is 3.99%. The risk of cardiac complications should be evaluated in elderly patients and those with ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal disease, more specifically, when emergent or long duration major surgeries are needed.
