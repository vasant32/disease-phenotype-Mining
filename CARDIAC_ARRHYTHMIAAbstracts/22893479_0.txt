The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system modulate cardiac rhythm and the probability of arrhythmia occurrence. Both increased sympathetic drive and hypoxia increase the likelihood for ventricular fibrillation (VF). Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can protect from fatal arrhythmias via cholinergic and nitrergic action. We sought to determine boundary conditions for VF and defibrillation by autonomic manipulations accompanied or not by hypoxic changes in urethane-anesthetized rats. VF was induced with (1) vagotomy, (2) systemic high-dose (>15 mg/kg) isoproterenol, and (3) hypoxemia. When VNS (50 Hz) produced cardiac standstill, it converted every VF episode (59/59). A nitric oxide synthase inhibitor did not reduce VNS efficacy (13/14 episodes converted), but addition of atropine reduced VNS efficacy (11/27 episodes converted). VF can be induced by autonomic derangements only under constrained conditions, including sympathetic over-activation, reduced parasympathetic input, and hypoxemia. VNS can provide an alternative method to defibrillate via its cholinergic action.
