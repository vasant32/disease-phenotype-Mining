Acute hepatotoxicity is a rare but potentially fatal complication of amiodarone use. Although oral long-term use of the drug is frequently complicated by an asymptomatic rise in serum aminotransferase concentrations, acute hepatotoxicity during intravenous loading is much less frequent and potentially fatal. We report a case of liver injury after intravenous administration in a patient with atrial fibrillation.
