Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia with an estimated clinical prevalence of approximately 1% in the general population and as high as 9% in individuals by the age of 80 years. The aetiology is multifactorial. Systemic disease, e.g., inflammatory processes, sarcoidosis, autoimmune disorders, has also been linked to the development of AF. Myocardial dysfunction observed in sepsis could contribute to arrhythmias and inflammation per se could induce or provoke AF. We describe the successful management of an acute AF in an elderly patient scheduled for emergency laparotomy and closure of hollow viscous perforation.
