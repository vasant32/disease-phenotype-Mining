Superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction is an uncommon, but serious, complication of transvenous device implantation. We present a case of a 52-year-old lady admitted for upgrade to a biventricular pacemaker with significant SVC stenosis. Percutaneous balloon venoplasty of the SVC followed by insertion of biventricular pacing leads was carried out as a single procedure with no complications.
