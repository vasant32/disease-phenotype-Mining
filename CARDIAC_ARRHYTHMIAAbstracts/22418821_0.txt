Chemexfoliation is an excellent method to reduce facial rhytids. For 25 years, we have used the traditional formula as described by T. J. Baker but with a moist healing technique rather than a tape mask. We have found the peel to be inexpensive and easy to perform, with results that are excellent and consistent, with minimal side effects.
