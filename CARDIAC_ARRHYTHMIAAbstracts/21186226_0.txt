 AIMS: To study anterograde atrioventricular (A-V) nodal electrophysiological properties through the right-atrial (Ri) and left-atrial inputs (Li) under the pharmacological autonomic blockade (AUB) in patients with slow-fast A-V nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and in controls. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients with slow-fast AVNRT and 15 control subjects were included. Programmed stimulation with single extrastimulus was performed from the right atrial appendage to test the Ri, and from the posterolateral coronary sinus to test the Li. The AUB was induced with intravenous atropine (0.04 mg/kg) and metoprolol (0.15 mg/kg). The A-V nodal conduction times, refractoriness, discontinuous conduction (â‰¥ 40 ms atrial-His interval 'jump'), and inducibility of AVNRT or reciprocating beats were compared. The A-V nodal conduction times were longer: (i) through the Ri than Li, (ii) in patients than controls, and (iii) in baseline than after AUB--at slow rates in both groups and at fast rates in patients through the right input only (P < 0.05-0.001). A significantly longer slow pathway effective refractory period was demonstrated through the Li than the Ri in patients in baseline (P < 0.05). The discontinuous conduction was demonstrated 94 times in 25 of 29 (83%) patients and 15 times in 6 of 15 (40%) controls (P < 0.01), and was most frequently encountered with the Ri testing. Likewise, inducibility was manifested most frequently with the Ri testing (P = 0.08), and decreased after AUB during this testing only (P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: The inherent magnitude of discordance of A-V nodal conduction velocity, refractoriness, and parasympathetic modulation between the Ri and Li to the A-V node may play a role in the aetiology of AVNRT.
