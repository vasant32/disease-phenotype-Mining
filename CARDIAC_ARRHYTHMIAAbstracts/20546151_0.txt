Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF) is defined as spontaneous VF in the absence of structural heart disease. No prior reports exist addressing the technical aspects of idiopathic VF ablation in a child. We present the case of a 10-year-old boy with idiopathic VF, who presented a unique management challenge, particularly as regards the technical aspects of the ablation procedure. Ablation of idiopathic VF is feasible in a 10-year-old boy and oral quinidine seems more effective than other antiarrhythmic drugs in this condition.
