We describe a case of diabetic ketoacidosis with concomitant hyperkalaemia that uncovered a typical Brugada syndrome electrocardiogram (ECG). Further provocation testing in the patient and his son confirmed familial Brugada syndrome. Diabetic ketoacidosis with hyperkalaemia may uncover an inheritable arrhythmia syndrome that may put the patient and his/her next of kin at risk for a sudden death, irrespective of diabetes mellitus.
