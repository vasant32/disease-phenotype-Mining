Sudden cardiac arrest in young healthy adults has concerned the medical and social communities due to its fatal effect. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) has been demonstrated to be an effective measure for prevention of sudden death in patients at risk of ventricular arrhythmia. Subcutaneous ICD has been developed to overcome some problems associated with transvenous leads in the conventional ICD. In this case report, we describe the use of completely subcutaneous ICD for a young patient with pectus excavatum following presentation with out-of-hospital VF arrest with no complication in device or lead positioning.
