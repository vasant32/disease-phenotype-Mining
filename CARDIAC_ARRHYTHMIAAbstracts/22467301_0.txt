Cardiac alternans is a recognized risk factor for cardiac arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. At the cellular level, Ca(2+) alternans appears as cytosolic Ca(2+) transients of alternating amplitude at regular beating frequency. Cardiac alternans is a multifactorial process but has been linked to disturbances in intracellular Ca(2+) regulation. In atrial myocytes, we tested the role of voltage-gated Ca(2+) current, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) load, and restitution properties of SR Ca(2+) release for the occurrence of pacing-induced Ca(2+) alternans. Voltage-clamp experiments revealed that peak Ca(2+) current was not affected during alternans, and alternans of end-diastolic SR Ca(2+) load, evaluated by application of caffeine or measured directly with an intra-SR fluorescent Ca(2+) indicator (fluo-5N), were not a requirement for cytosolic Ca(2+) alternans. Restitution properties and kinetics of refractoriness of Ca(2+) release after activation during alternans were evaluated by four different approaches: measurements of 1) the delay (latency) of occurrence of spontaneous global Ca(2+) releases and 2) Ca(2+) spark frequency, both during rest after a large and small alternans Ca(2+) transient; 3) the magnitude of premature action potential-induced Ca(2+) transients after a large and small beat; and 4) the efficacy of a photolytically induced Ca(2+) signal (Ca(2+) uncaging from DM-nitrophen) to trigger additional Ca(2+) release during alternans. The results showed that the latency of global spontaneous Ca(2+) release was prolonged and Ca(2+) spark frequency was decreased after the large Ca(2+) transient during alternans. Furthermore, the restitution curve of the Ca(2+) transient elicited by premature action potentials or by photolysis-induced Ca(2+) release from the SR lagged behind after a large-amplitude transient during alternans compared with the small-amplitude transient. The data demonstrate that beat-to-beat alternation of the time-dependent restitution properties and refractory kinetics of the SR Ca(2+) release mechanism represents a key mechanism underlying cardiac alternans.
