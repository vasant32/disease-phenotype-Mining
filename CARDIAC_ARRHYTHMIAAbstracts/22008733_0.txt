Ghrelin is a novel growth hormone-releasing peptide, which has been shown to exert beneficial effects on ventricular remodeling. In this study, we investigated whether ghrelin could decrease vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmias in rats with myocardial infarction and the possible mechanism. Twenty-four hours after ligation of the anterior descending artery, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to ghrelin (100 Î¼g/kg) and saline (control group) for 4 weeks. Sham animals underwent thoracotomy and pericardiotomy, but not LAD ligation. Myocardial endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels were significantly elevated in saline-treated rats at the border zone compared with sham-operated rats. Myocardial connexin43 (Cx43) expression at the border zone was significantly decreased in saline-treated infarcted rats compared with sham-operated rats. Ghrelin significantly decreased the inducibility of ventricular tachyarrhythmias compared with control group. Arrhythmias sores during programmed stimulation in saline-treated rats were significantly higher than scores in those treated with ghrelin. The electrophysiological improvement of fatal ventricular tachyarrhythmias was accompanied with increased immunofluorescence-stained Cx43, myocardial Cx43 protein and mRNA levels in ghrelin treated rats. We also shown that ghrelin significantly decreased tissue ET-1 levels at the infarcted border zone. Thus, ghrelin showed the protective effect on ventricular arrhythmias after myocardial infarction. Although the precise mechanism by which ghrelin modulates the dephosphorylation of Cx43 remains unknown, it is most likely that the ghrelin increased expression of Cx43 through the inhibition of ET-1.
