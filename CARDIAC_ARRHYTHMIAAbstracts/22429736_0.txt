 INTRODUCTION: We examined circadian periodicity of atrial tachyarrhythmias (AT/AF) in a large group of patients with implantable devices, which allow continuous collection of the event data over prolonged periods of time. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 16,130 AT/AF events were recorded in 236 patients (age: 63 ± 12 years, 27% female, 90% had a history of cardiovascular disease, 33% ischemic, LVEF: 49 ± 18%) over a period of 12 months. To exclude interactions with therapy, the patterns of arrhythmia occurrence were examined for all events and for those episodes that were preceded by at least 1, 6, and 24 hours of sinus rhythm. To prevent biasing toward patients with more frequent episodes, the patterns of AT/AF onset were analyzed both in absolute and patient-normalized (i.e., divided by the total number of events in each patient) units per hour per patient and then summarized for the entire group. In patients with <4 AT/AF events, the onset times were randomly distributed over 24-hour period. However, as the number of AT/AF events increased, a nocturnal pattern of occurrence (determined by the occurrence of a trough around noon) gradually emerged and became highly statistically significant (P < 10(-4) ). The magnitude of nocturnal peak of AT/AF events was well explained by a single-exponential function (R(2) = 0.97, P < 10(-2) ). CONCLUSION: Patients with more frequent atrial tachyarrhythmias are more likely to develop AT/AF at night. Knowledge of patient-specific circadian patterns of arrhythmia occurrence can be useful for personalized management of individuals with significant arrhythmia burden.
