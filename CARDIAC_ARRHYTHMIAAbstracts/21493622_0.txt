We tested the efficacy and feasibility of percutaneous subxiphoid video pericardial endoscopy in five dogs. After percutaneous subxiphoid puncture, steerable 9F endoscope and 7F irrigated-tip catheters were advanced into the epicardial space. Epicardial vessels were visualized, and basal fat was distinguishable. Lesions created by the irrigated-tip catheter could be also appreciated on the epicardial surface. The endoscopic pericardial procedure was successful and may increase the efficacy and safety of epicardial irrigated radiofrequency catheter ablation.
