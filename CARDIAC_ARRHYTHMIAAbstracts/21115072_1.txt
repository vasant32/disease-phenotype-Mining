The angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) blocker (ARB) Losartan has cardioprotective effects during ischemia-reperfusion injury and inhibits reperfusion arrhythmias -effects that go beyond the benefits of lowering blood pressure. The renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin systems are intricately connected and some of the cardioprotective effects of Losartan are abolished by blocking the bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R) signaling. In this study, we investigated the ability of six clinically available ARBs to specifically bind and activate the B2R. First, we investigated their ability to activate phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis in COS-7 cells transiently expressing the B2R. We found that only Losartan activated the B2R, working as a partial agonist compared to the endogenous ligand bradykinin. This effect was blocked by the B2R antagonist HOE 140. A competitive binding analysis revealed that Losartan does not significantly compete with bradykinin and does not change the binding affinity of bradykinin on the B2R. Furthermore, Losartan but not Candesartan mimicked the ability of bradykinin to increase the recovery of contractile force after metabolic stress in rat atrial tissue strips. In conclusion, Losartan is a partial agonist of the B2R through direct binding and activation, suggesting that B2R agonism could partly explain the beneficial effects of Losartan.
