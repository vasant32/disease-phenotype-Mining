The compound MG-1(R,S), (1-[2-hydroxy-3(4-phenyl-1-piperazinyl)propyl]-pyrrolidin-2-one, and its enantiomers were tested for electrocardiographic, antiarrhythmic and hypotensive activities. The racemic mixture (MG-1(R,S)) and its S-enantiomer significantly decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure and possessed antiarrhythmic activity. The S-enantiomer displayed the greatest effect. The R-enantiomer did not show antiarrhythmic or hypotensive activity. The results suggest that the antiarrhythmic and hypotensive effects of these compounds are related to their adrenolytic properties.
