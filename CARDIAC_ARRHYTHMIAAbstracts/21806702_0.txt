 INTRODUCTION: The close proximity between the interventionalist and patient during catheter-based interventions for cardiac arrhythmia exposes the interventionalist to harmful radiation. A prototype remote catheter navigation system (RCNS) has been developed to reduce occupational dose. The safety, feasibility of this RCNS and a comparison of remote and conventional navigation techniques is investigated in vivo. METHODS: Seven anatomical locations in the right side of the heart in porcine models were chosen as navigation targets. Using fluoroscopy and electrogram analysis, an experienced electrophysiology interventionalist manipulated a radiofrequency (RF) ablation catheter to each target using the RCNS and conventional navigation. Success rate, navigation time, exposure, exposure time and procedure time was recorded for all anatomical targets. Time to integrate the RCNS with the procedure suite was also measured. RESULTS: All targets were successfully reached with the RCNS and conventional navigation. No erratic catheter motion was observed with the RCNS whereas 1 operation failure occurred. The anatomical targets were found to have the largest effect on navigation time (P < 0.05), exposure (P < 0.05), and exposure time (P < 0.01), although the navigation method had little to no effect on the metrics. These results suggest that remote navigation procedures can be performed with navigation times comparable to conventional bedside navigation. CONCLUSION: Remote navigation with the RCNS may present a safe method of reducing occupational dose, while providing comparable navigation time with conventional bedside navigation.
