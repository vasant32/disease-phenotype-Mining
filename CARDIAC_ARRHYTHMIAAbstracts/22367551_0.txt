Conventional catheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias is associated with the potential adverse effects of low-dose ionizing radiation on both patients and laboratory personnel. Due to the greater radiation sensitivity and the longer life expectancy of children, reduction of radiation exposure for them is of particular importance. A novel technique for zero-fluoroscopy catheter ablation is described using real-time tissue-tip contact force measurements for a 10-year-old boy who had Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with a left-sided accessory pathway.
