 BACKGROUND: Use of programmed electrical stimulation (PES) for risk stratification of Brugada syndrome (BrS) is controversial. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the role of the number of extrastimuli during PES in patients with BrS. METHODS: Consecutive 108 patients with type 1 electrocardiogram (104 men, mean age 46 ± 12 years; 26 with ventricular fibrillation [VF], 40 with syncope, and 42 asymptomatic) underwent PES with a maximum of 3 extrastimuli from the right ventricular apex and the right ventricular outflow tract. Ventricular arrhythmia (VA) was defined as VF or nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia >15 beats. Patients with VA induced by a single extrastimulus or double extrastimuli were assigned to group SD (Single/Double), by triple extrastimuli to group T (Triple), and the remaining patients to group N. RESULTS: VA was induced in 81 patients (VF in 71 and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in 10), in 4 by a single extrastimulus, in 41 by double extrastimuli, and in 36 by triple extrastimuli. During 79 ± 48 months of follow-up, 24 patients had VF events. Although the overall inducibility of VA was not associated with an increased risk of VF (log-rank P = .78), group SD had worse prognosis than did group T (P = .004). Kaplan-Meier analysis in patients without prior VF also showed that group SD had poorer outcome than did group T and group N (P = .001). Positive and negative predictive values of VA induction with up to 2 extrastimuli were, respectively, 36% and 87%, better than those with up to 3 (23% and 81%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The number of extrastimuli that induced VA served as a prognostic indicator for patients with Brugada type 1 electrocardiogram. Single extrastimulus or double extrastimuli were adequate for PES of patients with BrS.
