Large blood transfusions are common in clinical practice. Though several complications have been described with this procedure, cardiac arrhythmias occur uncommonly in this setting. We describe a case of a previously healthy 17-year-old girl who developed wide-complex ventricular tachycardia rapidly culminating in a ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest several hours following an uneventful large-volume blood transfusion. Hypomagnesemia was detected on postcardiac arrest investigations. A review of this life-threatening complication and discussion on the ways to prevent it are presented.
