Inhalational anesthetic-induced preconditioning (APC) has been shown to reduce infarct size and attenuate contractile dysfunction caused by myocardial ischemia. Only a few studies have reported the effects of APC on arrhythmias during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, focusing exclusively on reperfusion. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to examine the influence of APC on ventricular arrhythmias evoked by regional no-flow ischemia. APC was induced in adult male Wistar rats by 12-min exposures to two different concentrations (0.5 and 1.0 MAC) of isoflurane followed by 30-min wash-out periods. Ventricular arrhythmias were assessed in the isolated perfused hearts during a 45-min regional ischemia and a subsequent 15-min reperfusion. Myocardial infarct size was determined after an additional 45 min of reperfusion. The incidence, severity and duration of ventricular arrhythmias during ischemia were markedly reduced by APC. The higher concentration of isoflurane had a larger effect on the incidence of ventricular fibrillation than the lower concentration. The incidence of ventricular tachycardia and reversible ventricular fibrillation during reperfusion was also significantly reduced by APC; the same was true for myocardial infarct size. In conclusion, we have shown that preconditioning with isoflurane confers profound protection against myocardial ischemia- and reperfusion-induced arrhythmias and lethal myocardial injury.
