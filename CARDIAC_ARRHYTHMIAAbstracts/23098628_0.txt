A 4-year-old male castrated Borzoi dog presented on referral for evaluation of pleural effusion, ventricular arrhythmias, and suspected dilated cardiomyopathy. Echocardiogram identified several masses along the chordae tendineae, as well as a long the annulus of the mitral valve. A blood culture was positive for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus lugdunensis. The dog was also positive for Bartonella DNA on PCR testing. Aggressive antibiotic therapy was instituted. However, the dog continued to have recurrent pleural effusion and progressive azotemia. The dog was euthanized 39 days after diagnosis. Necropsy confirmed the presence of intracardiac abscesses, thrombosis and endocarditis. S. lugdunensis is a recently identified rare cause of endocarditis in humans characterized by intracardiac abscess formation, highly destructive valvular lesions preferentially affecting the mitral valve and a high mortality rate. This is the first reported case of S. lugdunensis isolation in a dog with endocarditis.
