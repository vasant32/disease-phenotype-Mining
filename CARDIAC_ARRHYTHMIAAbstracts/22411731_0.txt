 AIMS: Cryoballoon (CB) ablation has proven very effective in achieving pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). The Achieve catheter (AC) is a novel inner lumen catheter designed to be used in conjunction with the CB, which serves the double purpose of a guidewire and a mapping catheter. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of CB ablation in conjunction with the novel AC, in terms of PVI and safety in a series of patients affected by drug resistant paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy patients (49 male) affected by paroxysmal AF were assigned to CB PVI using the AC as a mapping catheter. Patients underwent loop-Holter monitoring 1, 3 and 6 months after ablation. Isolation occurred in 98% of PVs with the CB-AC association without having switching to a regular guidewire. Pulmonary vein isolation could be documented by real-time (RT) recordings in 47% (132) of veins. Time to isolation was significantly longer in PVs exhibiting early left atrium-PV reconnection if compared with veins with sustained isolation (117 ± 25 s vs. 59 ± 25 s; P< 0,005). No serious complications occurred; four transient phrenic nerve palsies occurred all resolving completely before the end of the procedure. CONCLUSION: Cryoballoon ablation in conjunction with the novel AC is feasible, safe, and most importantly affords PVI in nearly all veins without having to switch to a regular guidewire. However, RT recordings could be documented in only 47% of pulmonary veins.
