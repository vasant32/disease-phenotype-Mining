Left-sided ventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy is rare and represents a rather different expression of the arrhythmogenic right ventricular (RV) cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Among sudden cardiac deaths, ARVC plays a significant role. ARVC is considered as a cardiomyopathy of unknown aetiology that primarily involves the right ventricle (RV) and is characterized by progressive replacement of myocytes by fibro-fatty tissue, complicating a spectrum of arrhythmias. Predominant ARVC with left ventricular (LV) involvement is also reported. The LV variant of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy with minimal or no RV involvement is rare. A 31-year-old previously healthy young man, without a significant family history, was found dead in bed. Autopsy revealed an enlarged heart and asymmetrical LV hypertrophy with widely patent coronary arteries. LV myocardium demonstrated evidence of prominent epicardial fibro-fatty tissue that is predominantly fatty in nature and infiltrates into the myocardium. Microscopy of the LV free wall showed fibro-fatty tissue infiltration into the epicardial aspect of the LV that extends well into the mid-myocardium. A moderate to marked degree of interstitial fibrous tissue deposition was noted about adipocytes and cardiomyocytes. There was no evidence of chronic ischaemic changes or of significant myofibre disarray. The RV showed minimal fibro-fatty infiltration with normal myocytes. This report highlights a rare case which confirms previous observations that the LV variant of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy could occur with minimal or no involvement of the RV. Further studies are required in this context to elicit the spectrum and the exact nature of this disease.
