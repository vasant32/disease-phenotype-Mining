The long QT syndrome (LQTS) is occasionally complicated by impaired atrioventricular (AV) conduction. This form of LQTS can manifest before birth or during neonatal life, and no previous report has demonstrated LQTS complicated by impaired AV conduction in elderly patient. This case report describes an elderly patient with an acquired form of LQTS who developed ventricular fibrillation that was successfully defibrillated during admission to the hospital. Electrophysiologic study demonstrated that HV interval was 38 milliseconds and QT interval was 635 milliseconds during sinus rhythm cycle length of 1167 milliseconds. 1:1 AV conduction was maintained to a pacing cycle length of 545 milliseconds with an AH interval of 144 milliseconds, HV interval of 44 milliseconds, and right ventricular monophasic action potential duration of 360 milliseconds. However, 2:1 HV block developed at a pacing cycle length of 500 milliseconds. Intravenous administration of mexiletine decreased the cycle length of developing HV block to 360 milliseconds.
