Intramural measurements of V(m) and Ca(i)(2+) are important in the studies of cardiac arrhythmias and defibrillation. We developed a new design of an "optrode" (bundle of optical fibers) for use in intramural cardiac mapping. The optrodes are made from seven optical fibers with the fiber ends polished at 45Â° angle and coated with mirror surfaces. The optrodes are enclosed in smooth epoxy resin cast, which protects mirror surfaces from damage and ensures constant optrode diameter along its length. The optrodes are strong enough to be easily inserted into heart muscle, can be reused multiple times, and they may reduce artifacts in the measurements of the effects of defibrillation shocks on V(m).
