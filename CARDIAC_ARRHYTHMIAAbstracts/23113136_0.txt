 BACKGROUND: The purpose of this research was to determine the relation between negative or positive qualitative troponin I test and the short term prognosis of patients presenting to emergency department with chest pain or angina equivalent symptoms. METHODS: we assessed the qualitative rapid troponin I in patients with chest pain or angina equivalent symptoms after at least 4 hours and then we followed the patients in 72 hours after presentation for adverse events such as death, CCU admission, fatal arrhythmias and heart failure. RESULTS: After comparing qualitative troponin I test results and adverse events, we concluded that the troponin I was significantly more positive in patients with adverse events (i.e. CCU admission, fatal arrhythmias and heart failure) (P=0.031). CONCLUSION: A single measurement of rapid qualitative troponin I test can be used as a prognostic factor in patients with chest pain or angina equivalent symptoms and also as a device for risk stratification of moderate and high risk patients.
