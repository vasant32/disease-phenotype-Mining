Short-QT Syndrome. A 28-year-old man was admitted after aborted sudden cardiac death while sleeping. QTc was 320 ms, suggesting short-QT syndrome (SQTS). The patient then presented with electrical storm with 8 successive episodes of ventricular fibrillation while on deep sedation and hypothermia. Isoproterenol infusion was introduced, leading to rapid cessation of any arrhythmic event. Isoproterenol can be effective in managing electrical storm in patients with SQTS.
