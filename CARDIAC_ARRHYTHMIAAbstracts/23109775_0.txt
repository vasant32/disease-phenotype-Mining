Paradoxical hemodynamic instability is defined as unexpected hemodynamic compromise that develops in a patient after pericardial fluid drainage. The overall incidence of the condition is about 5%, and it has a high in-hospital mortality rate. The condition has been reported to occur regardless of the approach that is used to drain the fluid or the underlying cause of the disease. The pathophysiology of paradoxical hemodynamic instability and the appropriate intervention are not very clear, and further studies are needed to identify appropriate preventive measures.We report a rare manifestation of paradoxical hemodynamic instability in a 65-year-old woman who had a history of stage IV lung cancer. She presented with a one-week history of pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath on exertion. Echocardiography revealed a large circumferential pericardial effusion with right atrial and ventricular collapse during diastole, suggesting a compressive effect of the pericardial fluid; however, left ventricular systolic function was well preserved. The patient underwent the scheduled creation of a subxiphoid pericardial window. Immediately after the pericardial fluid was evacuated, her heart began to beat more vigorously, but this was abruptly followed by an episode of asystole. Pacing and medical therapy were unsuccessful in preventing repeated episodes of asystole, and the patient died.To our knowledge, this is the 2nd report of unexpected asystole after the creation of a subxiphoid pericardial window, and it is the first report of a takotsubo-like contractile pattern associated with paradoxical hemodynamic instability.
