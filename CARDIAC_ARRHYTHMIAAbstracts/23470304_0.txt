Exercise related palpitations, vertigo, and syncope may be caused by benign etiologies but can also herald life-threatening arrhythmias. The precise diagnosis of these findings is therefore essential and potentially life saving but often is a challenge for sports physicians and cardiologists.Leadless, ambulatory heart rate monitors with chest strap transmitters have been designed to steer exercise intensity in athletes with a baseline sinus rhythm. However, they also can capture arrhythmias. Presented here are three cases of varying arrhythmias: atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, and ectopic atrial tachycardia that demonstrate the utility of heart rate monitors designed for athletic purposes in facilitating the diagnosis of arrhythmias and guiding appropriate treatment.
