We studied the electrophysiological characteristics of systolic (SP) and diastolic (DP) potentials recorded during sinus rhythm (SR) in the left interventricular septum of a 27 year-old woman presenting with verapamil-sensitive idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia (VT). During SR, and during VT, SP was activated from ventricular base-to-apex, and DP from apex-to-base. SP and DP were both detected at the site of successful ablation during SR, whereas during VT, DP was detected away from the earliest activation site. Thus, SP apparently reflected a critical component of the reentrant circuit, while DP reflected the activation of a bystander pathway.
