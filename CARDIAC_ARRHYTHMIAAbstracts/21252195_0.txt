 AIMS: Intracardiac electrograms (IEGMs) recorded by implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are essential for arrhythmia diagnosis and ICD therapy assessment. Short IEGM snapshots showing 3-10 s before arrhythmia detection were added to the Biotronik Home Monitoring system in 2005 as the first-generation IEGM Online. The RIONI study tested the primary hypothesis that experts' ratings regarding the appropriateness of ICD therapy based on IEGM Online and on standard 30 s IEGM differ in <10% of arrhythmia events. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 619 ICD patients were enrolled and followed for 1 year. According to a predefined procedure, 210 events recorded by the ICDs were selected for evaluation. Three expert board members rated the appropriateness of ICD therapy and classified the underlying arrhythmia using coded IEGM Online and standard IEGM to avoid bias. The average duration of IEGM Online was 4.4Â±1.5 s. According to standard IEGM, the underlying arrhythmia was ventricular in 135 episodes (64.3%), supraventricular in 53 episodes (25.2%), oversensing in 17 episodes (8.1%), and uncertain in 5 episodes (2.4%). The expert board's rating diverged between determinable IEGM Online tracings and standard IEGM in 4.6% of episodes regarding the appropriateness of ICD therapy (95% CI up to 8.0%) and in 6.6% of episodes regarding arrhythmia classification (95% CI up to 10.5%). CONCLUSION: By enabling accurate evaluation of the appropriateness of ICD therapy and the underlying arrhythmia, the first-generation IEGM Online provided a clinically effective basis for timely interventions and for optimized patient management schemes, which was comparable with current IEGM recordings.
