 BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, including atrial arrhythmias. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the gold standard treatment for OSA; its impact on atrial electrical remodelling has not been fully investigated. Signal-averaged p-wave (SAPW) duration is an accepted marker for atrial electrical remodelling. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine whether CPAP induces reverse atrial electrical remodelling in patients with severe OSA. METHODS: Consecutive patients attending the Sleep Disorder Clinic at Kingston General Hospital underwent full polysomnography. OSA-negative controls and severe OSA were defined as apnoea-hypopnea index (AHI) < 5 events/hour and AHI ≥ 30 events/hour, respectively. SAPW duration was determined at baseline and after 4-6 weeks of CPAP in severe OSA patients or without intervention controls. RESULTS: Nineteen severe OSA patients and 10 controls were included in the analysis. Mean AHI and minimum oxygen saturation were 41.4 ± 10.1 events/hour and 80.5 ± 6.5 % in severe OSA patients and 2.8 ± 1.2 events/hour and 91.4 ± 2.1 % in controls. At baseline, severe OSA patients had a greater SAPW duration than controls (131.9 ± 10.4 vs 122.8 ± 10.5 ms; p = 0.02). After CPAP, there was a significant reduction of SAPW duration in severe OSA patients (131.9 ± 10.4 to 126.2 ± 8.8 ms; p < 0.001), while SAPW duration did not change after 4-6 weeks in controls. CONCLUSION: CPAP induced reverse atrial electrical remodelling in patients with severe OSA as represented by a significant reduction in SAPW duration.
