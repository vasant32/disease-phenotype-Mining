Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) can lead to multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Electrocardiographic (ECG), cardiac enzyme, and serum magnesium abnormalities occur after SAP. Electrocardiographic and cardiac enzyme abnormalities are described as variables in SAP patients, which contribute to the effects of MODS. Hypomagnesium is also closely associated with ECG abnormalities; therefore, hypomagnesium was also considered to be a variable in this study. A consecutive series of 54 patients admitted within 72 hours after SAP occurred was studied. A standard 12-lead ECG, cardiac enzyme, and serum magnesium measurement were routinely performed at admission. Linear correlation was used to analyze the relationship between hypomagnesemia and sinus tachycardia. The nonparametic binomial test was used to analyze dichotomized dependent variables (premature beat, atrial fibrillation, ST-segment depression, abnormal T wave, and long QT interval). Hypomagnesemia was present in 15 patients (28%), who subsequently had sinus tachycardia. There was a significant negative relationship (-1 < r <0) between hypomagnesemia and sinus tachycardia (p < .05). There were 14 (17%) premature beat, 7 (8%) atrial fibrillation, 21 (25%) ST-segment depression, 18 (21%) abnormal T wave, and 17 (31%) long QT-interval events in 54 SAP patients. Hypomagnesemia is a reason for ECG abnormalities. Electrocardiographic and cardiac enzyme abnormalities are considered to be transitory variables that are present in patients with SAP.
