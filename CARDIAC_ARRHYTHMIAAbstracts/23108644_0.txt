 BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is a chronic and very common condition, and there has been lately a considerable increase in its prevalence and incidence. Diabetic patients have increased cardiovascular mortality, in which malignant ventricular arrhythmias seem to be implicated. OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of diabetes on ventricular repolarization parameters responsible for an increased susceptibility to malignant ventricular arrhythmias and/or sudden death. METHODS: We selected a group of 110 diabetic patients and a group of 110 controls with the same distribution of age, gender and race. We evaluated the following parameters of ventricular repolarization: QT(max), QT(mean), QT(min), QTc(max), QTc(mean), QTc(min), QT and QTc dispersions, T(peak)-T(end) and jT(peak)-jT(end) intervals (D(II), V(2) and V(5)), T(peak)-T(end) and jT(peak)-jT(end) dispersions. The electrocardiograms (ECG) were performed by the same operator and reviewed by the same observers. QT intervals were corrected according to Bazzet's formula. RESULTS: We found significantly higher values of QTc(max) (p < 0.001), QTc(mean) (p < 0.001), QT dispersion (p < 0.001), QTc dispersion (p < 0.001), T(peak)-T(end) dispersion ( p < 0.001), and jT(peak)-jT(end) dispersion (p < 0.001) in diabetic patients than in controls. In diabetic patients, we observed prolonged values of QTc interval (5.5%), QT dispersion (0.9%), QTc dispersion (0%), T(peak)-T(end) interval (7.3%), jT(peak)-jT(end) interval (6.4%), T(peak)-T(end) dispersion (16.4%), and jT(peak)-jT(end) dispersion (12.7%). In the controls there were no prolonged values of any of the parameters. CONCLUSION: We concluded that diabetes causes prolongation and spatial dispersion of repolarization, and it may contribute to a greater ventricular electrical instability, whose expected clinical expression may be malignant ventricular arrhythmias.
