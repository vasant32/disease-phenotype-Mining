Remote monitoring is useful for management of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) patients regarding detection of arrhythmias and probable device or lead failure. We report the case of a patient who died suddenly while being on remote monitoring. The ICD was not retrieved postmortem. Even though clinical circumstances were suspicious of an arrhythmic death, this was excluded due to a distinctive manufacturer feature of the system.
