 OBJECTIVES: Determinant risk factors for developing protein losing enteropathy (PLE), including haemodynamics, remain unclear in patients after the Fontan operation. METHODS: Our purpose was to characterize the serial PLE haemodynamics before and after the onset and to determine the risk factors based on the cardiac catheterization-based analysis. RESULTS: Of 354 Fontan survivors who had undergone postoperative cardiac catheterizations, we experienced 26 PLE patients during the follow-up. Non-left ventricular morphology systemic ventricle, functional one-lung pulmonary circulation and an early postoperative high central venous pressure (CVP) were associated with the PLE onset and the high CVP (odds ratio (OR) = 1.19 per 1 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.37, especially â‰¥12 mmHg, OR = 3.09, 95% CI 1.25-7.64, P < 0.05 for both) and one-lung pulmonary circulation (OR = 10.0-10.5, P < 0.001) independently predicted the onset. At the time of the PLE onset, a Fontan route stenosis/obstruction, arrhythmias, ventricular dysfunction/heart failure and pulmonary arterio-venous fistulae were demonstrated in 10 (38%), 8 (31%), 4 (15%) and 3 (12%) patients, respectively. When compared with 56 excellent Fontan survivors, the high CVP, ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and pulmonary artery resistance, and the low arterial oxygen saturation, systemic artery pressure, and ventricular ejection fraction characterized the pre-PLE Fontan haemodynamics (P < 0.05-0.0001). However, the following intensive treatments reduced the CVP, systemic artery pressure and cardiac output (P < 0.05-0.01), resulting in haemodynamics no different from those of the excellent survivors, except for the low systemic pressure (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The pre-PLE haemodynamics was characterized by several impaired haemodynamics, while those after PLE only by a low systemic pressure. A high early postoperative CVP was the only haemodynamic predictor for a new onset of PLE. Strict selective criteria for the operation and strategies to eliminate CVP-raising factors are mandatory to prevent a new onset of PLE.
