The purpose of the EP wire is to examine the clinical practice in the management of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), with special focus on diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Forty-five European centres, all members of the EHRA-EP Research network completed the questions of the survey. There was an equal distribution of centres with high, medium, and low volume of activity. The most common aetiologies were: post-myocardial infarction ischaemic heart disease (55%), followed by idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (18%), and idiopathic VT (11%) and others (12%). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed in more than 50% of patients in 24 centres (62.2%). Invasive electrophysiological study was performed in more than 70% of patients in 16 centres (35.6%), between 51 and 70% in 9 (20%), below 50% in 20 (44.5%). In 39 centres (86.7%), implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation was considered in all patients with structural heart disease and left ventricular ejection fraction <35%. In the setting of secondary prevention, early radiofrequency ablation of the VT was performed in more than 50% of the patients in only five centres (11.4%). Sequential endo-epicardial approach was reported in 52.2% of centres.
