Ventricular allorhythmia is an electrocardiogram feature leading to a pattern of "regularly irregular" arrhythmia mainly reported during non-life-threatening organized atrial tachycardia. We report the infrequent case of a patient presenting with ventricular allorhythmia during infarct-related ventricular tachycardia. The potential mechanisms of this tachycardia are discussed.
