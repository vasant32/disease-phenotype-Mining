The present longitudinal study examined relations between respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) development and social responsiveness characteristics associated with autism spectrum disorders. Group-based developmental trajectory modeling was used to characterize RSA development patterns in 106 typically developing children across 5, 10, 24, 36, and 48 months of age. A two-group model fit of RSA development was found: a "typically" and "atypically" developing group. The typical group gradually increased in RSA across 5-48 months of age. The atypical group, however, increased in RSA from 5 to 24 months and demonstrated a plateau or "delay" in RSA development from 24 to 48 months. The atypical RSA development group also demonstrated more difficulties in parent-reported social responsiveness at 48 months. The results support current literature that identifies RSA as a marker of social functioning level. Â© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Dev Psychobiol.
