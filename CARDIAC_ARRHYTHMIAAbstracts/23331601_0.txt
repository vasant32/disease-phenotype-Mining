Improved survival in children with complex congenital cardiac disease, such as conotruncal abnormalities, has created a sub-population of children and young adults who need comprehensive multi-disciplinary long-term follow-up. Routine surveillance with comprehensive screening for structural heart disease, functional heart disease, thromboembolic disease, arrhythmias, and associated end-organ dysfunction is important. Future research will better define the care plans for routine surveillance in patients with conotruncal abnormalities.
