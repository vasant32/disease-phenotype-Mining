Background: Overexpression of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs) attenuates ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury in cultured cardiomyocytes. However, it is not known whether UCPs play an essential role in cardioprotection in the intact heart. This study evaluated the cardioprotective efficacy of UCPs against IR injury and characterized the mechanism of UCP-mediated protection in addition the role of UCPs in ischemic preconditioning (IPC). Method and Results: Cardiac UCP3 knockout (UCP3(-/-)) and wild type (WT) mice heart were subjected to the in vitro and in vivo models of IR injury and IPC. Isolated UCP3(-/-) mouse hearts were retrogradely perfused found to have poorer recovery of left ventricular function compared to WT hearts under IR conditions. In vivo occlusion of the left coronary artery resulted in two-fold larger infarcts in UCP3(-/-) mice compared to WT mice. Moreover, the incidence of in vivo IR arrhythmias was higher in UCP3(-/-) mice. Myocardial energetics were significantly impaired with IR as reflected by a decreased ATP content and an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio. UCP3(-/-) hearts generated more reactive oxygen species (ROS) than WT hearts during IR. Pretreatment of UCP3(-/-) hearts with the pharmacologic uncoupling agent, FCCP, improved post-ischemic functional recovery. Also the protective efficacy of ischemic preconditioning (IPC) was abolished in UCP3(-/-) mice. Conclusions: UCP3 plays a critical role in cardioprotection against IR injury and the IPC phenomenon. There is increased myocardial vulnerability to IR injury in hearts lacking UCP3. The mechanisms of UCP3-mediated cardioprotection include regulation of myocardial energetics and ROS generation by UCP3 during IR.
