 BACKGROUND: Reports in the literature indicate that specialty clinics focusing on management of patients with specific chronic disorders have a significant positive impact on patient outcomes. Atrial fibrillation (AF), one of the most common forms of cardiac arrhythmia, affects millions of patients. Outcome data regarding the impact of managing patients with AF are limited. We established a specialty clinic focusing on management of patients with AF. The objective of our study was to evaluate the outcomes of treating AF patients in this clinic. METHODS: A team consisting of electrophysiologists and pharmacists designed a specific plan for managing and educating patients. This plan consisted of evaluation, implementation of an individualized treatment plan, patient education, medication management, and follow-up care. We reviewed the outcomes of patients who had clinic visits between November 2011 and March 2012. The primary outcome was the incidence of AF-related hospitalizations and stroke. RESULTS: Seventy one patients were included in the analysis. Out of 71 patients, we identified 17 (23.9%) patients who were hospitalized. Two of these 17 hospitalized patients had ischemic stroke events. CONCLUSION: When compared to published data in the existing literature, managing AF patients in specialty clinics reduces the incidence of AF-related hospitalizations and stroke.
