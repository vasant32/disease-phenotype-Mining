Arhytmology that is focused on diagnostics and therapy of heart rhythm disturbances and their complications has undergone dramatic development in last 2 decades. Widespread use of catheter ablation, introduction of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for prevention of sudden cardiac death and finally, development of cardiac resynchronization therapy have lead to decreased importance of drug treatment. Antiarhythmic drugs remain therapy of choice in management of atrial fibrillation and in some ventricular arrhythmias, especially in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator backup. Therefore, this review deals predominantly with a strategy of antiarythmic therapy in atrial fibrillation and discusses possible risks.
