 BACKGROUND: Total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) has not been studied in adults. We investigated early and midterm morbidity and mortality in adults undergoing TCPC and assessed risk factors for mortality. METHODS: Between June 1994 and October 2010, 30 adults (21.3 Â± 5.5 years) underwent TCPC (extracardiac conduit). Twenty-two patients who had palliated single ventricles underwent TCPC completions and 8 patients underwent TCPC conversions. Preoperative and perioperative data were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Six of 9 patients with preoperative atrial flutter or fibrillation or intraatrial reentry tachycardia were treated in the catheterization room. An aortic cross-clamp was necessary in 12 patients, and 16 TCPCs were fenestrated. Mean follow-up was 51 months (range, 4-198 months). Early mortality was 10%: 2 of 8 conversions and 1 of 22 completions. There was 1 late conversion death (at 56 months postoperatively). Postoperatively, 4 patients required pacemakers and 1 patient required long-term antiarrhythmic medication, but no heart transplantations were necessary. Risk factors for early mortality were arrhythmia (p = 0.02), aortic cross-clamp (p = 0.054), and extracorporeal circulation in hypothermia (p = 0.03). Risk factors for overall mortality were conversion (p = 0.047), absence of fenestration (p = 0.036), surgery before January 2006 (p = 0.036), aortic cross-clamp (p = 0.018), extracorporeal circulation in hypothermia (p = 0.008), and arrhythmia (p = 0.005). New York Heart Association functional class had improved at the last follow-up: preoperatively, 17 patients were in class II and 12 patients were in class III versus 18 patients in class I and 9 patients in class II postoperatively (p < 0.001). At the last clinical visit, systemic ventricular function was maintained, and no late supraventricular arrhythmia was found. CONCLUSIONS: Early and midterm TCPC results for adults are encouraging for completion but are disappointing for conversion. Identified risk factors for mortality should improve patient selection for TCPC.
