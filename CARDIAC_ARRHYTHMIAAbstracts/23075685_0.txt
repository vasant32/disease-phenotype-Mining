 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The number of patients with both lung cancer and coronary heart disease has increased for the last ten years. The aim of this study is to analyze the outcome of the combined treatment of radical surgery and off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCABG) for patients with both lung cancer and coronary heart disease. METHODS: The clinical data of 18 patients (16 males and 2 females, mean age of 66.11 years) with both lung cancer and coronary heart disease who went through combined surgical interventions between 2003 and 2012 were summarized and analyzed. The lung cancer in these patients was predominantly at stages I and II (TNM). All patients' cardio-pulmonary function was favorable. RESULTS: All the patients survived the operation, without any recorded death and new myocardial infarction occurrence during the perioperative period. Squamous carcinoma and adenocarcinoma were found in 10 and 8 patients, respectively. Pathological lung cancer stage was Ia in 2 cases, Ib in 8 cases, IIa in 3 cases, II b in 3 cases, and IIIa in 2 cases. The most frequently observed complications were cardiac arrhythmias, atelectasis, and pulmonary infections. The mean values of operating room time, postoperative drainage, drainage tube time, and blood transfusion were significantly different between video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) groups and thoractomy groups. No significant differences in survival rate were found (P=0.187). CONCLUSIONS: The combined method of OPCABG and pulmonary resection is a safe and effective treatment for patients with both lung cancer and coronary heart disease. VATS lobectomy is beneficial for lung cancer patients because it reduces lesions.
