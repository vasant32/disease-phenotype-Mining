The Fontan procedure has provided excellent surgical palliation for patients with various types of univentricular hearts, and it has evolved over time. Among many modifications, the lateral tunnel Fontan connection (LTF) and the extracardiac Fontan connection (ECF) are currently the most popular techniques for completing the total cavopulmonary connection. The advantages and disadvantages of both techniques are reviewed here. The advantages of the ECF includes adaptability to all types of univentricular hearts, ease of construction without aortic cross clamping and fewer atrial suture lines. The advantages of the LTF include the ability to complete Fontan circulation in young, very small patients with potential for growth. This review also compares post-operative arrhythmias and fluid dynamics associated with both techniques.
