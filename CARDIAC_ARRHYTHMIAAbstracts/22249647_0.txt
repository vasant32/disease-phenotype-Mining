 AIM: Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common postoperative arrhythmias following cardiac surgery. Despite many clinical studies, there is still no consensus on the most appropriate prevention strategy for atrial arrhythmia. A randomized prospective trial was conducted to determine the efficacy of intravenous landiolol administration in the early period after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) followed by treatment with carvedilol for prevention of atrial fibrillation. METHODS: Seventy consecutive patients were enrolled in the study prospectively. Patients in the treated group received landiolol intravenously (5 μg/kg/min) in the ICU immediately after surgery. Heart rate was maintained at 60-80 bpm and intravenous landiolol was continued at 0-10 μg/kg/min until oral drug administration was possible. All patients received oral carvedilol (2.5-5 mg/day) after extubation and this was continued postoperatively. The primary endpoint was the overall development of postoperative atrial fibrillation. RESULTS: Postoperative atrial fibrillation occurred in 4 (11.1%) of the 36 patients in the landiolol group, compared with 11 (32.3%) of the 34 patients in the control group, indicating that development of atrial fibrillation was significantly inhibited by landiolol (P=0.042). No major postoperative complications occurred in the landiolol group. CONCLUSION: Postoperative intravenous landiolol therapy followed by oral carvedilol may be more effective than oral carvedilol alone for prevention of atrial fibrillation after off-pump CABG. We also found that intravenous landiolol is well tolerated after cardiac surgery.
