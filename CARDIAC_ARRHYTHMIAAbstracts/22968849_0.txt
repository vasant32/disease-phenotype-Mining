 AIMS: We sought to characterise driving habits of contemporary implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a multicentre prospective observational study of consecutive ICD recipients. Non-commercial drivers with a valid licence were eligible. Patient and ICD data were recorded. All patients completed an anonymous questionnaire regarding their driving habits. Among 275 patients, 25 (9.1%) stopped driving permanently after ICD implantation. During a mean follow-up of 26.5 ± 4.5 months, 25.3% of patients received an ICD shock (52.5% appropriate). The median time to first shock was 7.0 (2.5, 17.5) months and was not significantly different between primary and secondary ICD patients. However, shocks (36.5 vs. 21.3%, P = 0.027) and recurrent shock episodes (17.5 vs. 6.2%, P = 0.011) were more common in secondary ICD patients. Physician-recommended driving restrictions were not recalled by 37.9% and not followed by 23.0% of patients. Overall, the mean duration of driving abstinence was 2.2 ± 2.9 and 3.6 ± 5.3 months for primary and secondary patients, respectively. Notably, 36.5% of secondary patients drove within 1 month. Eight patients (3.3%) received a shock while driving, five of which resulted in road traffic accidents. The annual risk of a shock while driving was 1.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Patient driving behaviour following ICD implantation is variable, with over one-third not remembering and almost one-quarter not adhering to physician-directed driving restrictions. Over one-third of secondary ICD patients drive within 1 month despite physician recommendations. Further studies are required to establish the optimal duration of driving restriction in ICD recipients.
