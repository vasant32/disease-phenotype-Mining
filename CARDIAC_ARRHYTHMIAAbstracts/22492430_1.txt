 BACKGROUND: Prior studies evaluating the efficacy of catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) among patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) have reported varied outcomes. More recently, studies have suggested that an epicardial ablation is necessary for improved outcomes after catheter ablation of VT. The overall objective of the present study was to assess the efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA) of VT in ARVD/C, with particular focus on newer ablation strategies, including epicardial catheter ablation. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study population included 87 patients with ARVD/C who underwent a total of 175 RFA procedures between 1992 and 2011 at 80 different electrophysiology centers. Recurrence of VT following RFA and effect of RFA on the burden of VT were assessed. The mean age of the cohort was 38±13 years. Over a mean follow-up of 88.3±66 months, the overall freedom from VT of the 175 procedures was 47%, 21%, and 15%, at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The cumulative freedom from VT following epicardial RFA was 64% and 45% at 1 and 5 years, respectively, which was significantly longer than endocardial RFA (P=0.021). Survival free of VT among procedures with 3D electroanatomic mapping was significantly longer compared to those without (P=0.016). Burden of VT was reduced irrespective of the ablation strategy (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although VT recurrences are common, RFA results in a significant reduction in the burden of VT in patients with ARVD/C. Further, although the use of 3D electroanatomic mapping systems and epicardial ablation strategies are associated with longer survival free of VT, recurrence rates remain considerable.
