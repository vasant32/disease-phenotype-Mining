 OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and clinical outcomes up to 1 year in patients undergoing combined simultaneous thoracoscopic surgical and transvenous catheter atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. BACKGROUND: The combination of the transvenous endocardial approach with the thoracoscopic epicardial approach in a single AF ablation procedure overcomes the limitations of both techniques and should result in better outcomes. METHODS: A cohort of 26 consecutive patients with AF who underwent hybrid thoracoscopic surgical and transvenous catheter ablation were followed, with follow-up of up to 1 year. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients (42% with persistent AF) underwent successful hybrid procedures. There were no complications. The mean follow-up period was 470 Â± 154 days. In 23% of the patients, the epicardial lesions were not transmural, and endocardial touch-up was necessary. One-year success, defined according to the Heart Rhythm Society, European Heart Rhythm Association, and European Cardiac Arrhythmia Society consensus statement for the catheter and surgical ablation of AF, was 93% for patients with paroxysmal AF and 90% for patients with persistent AF. Two patients underwent catheter ablation for recurrent AF or left atrial flutter after the hybrid procedure. CONCLUSIONS: A combined transvenous endocardial and thoracoscopic epicardial ablation procedure for AF is feasible and safe, with a single-procedure success rate of 83% at 1 year.
