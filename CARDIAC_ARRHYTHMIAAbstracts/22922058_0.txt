Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in clinical practice, but its pathogenesis is incompletely understood. Current evidences have highlighted the progression of atrial fibrosis and electrophysiological remodeling in AF development. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), the simplest phospholipid, is associated with fibrotic disease and promotes proliferation of a wide variety of fibroblast. It was demonstrated that LPA stimulation in many cell types such as human endothelial cells, human renal fibroblasts, and myoblasts, significantly upregulates connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression, which acts as a downstream signaling effector for transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) to drive fibrosis. We hypothesized that LPA could also evoke growth factor-like responses to atrial fibroblast, and subsequently induce atrial fibrosis to trigger AF. LPA is also verified to involve in numerous electrophysiological activities in non-myocardiocytes. So LPA is a possible cause of AF by initiating fibrosis response and altering electrophysiological properties in atrium. If the hypothesis is confirmed, LPA will act as a new target for AF treatment and administration of LPA receptor blockers may be applied in the prophylaxis of AF.
