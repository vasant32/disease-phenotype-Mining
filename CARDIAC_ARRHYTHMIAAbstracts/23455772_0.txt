PURPOSE: Appropriate adjustment of cardiac preload is essential to maintain cardiac output (CO), especially in patients after cardiac surgery. This study was intended to determine whether index of right ventricular end-diastolic volume (RVEDVI), corrected RVEDVI using ejection fraction (cRVEDVI), index of initial distribution volume of glucose (IDVGI), or cardiac filling pressures are correlated with cardiac index (CI) following cardiac surgery in the presence or absence of arrhythmias. METHODS: Eighty-six consecutive cardiac surgical patients were studied. Patients were divided into two groups: the non-arrhythmia (NA) group (n = 72) and the arrhythmia (A) group (n = 14). Three sets of measurements were performed: on admission to the ICU and daily on the first 2 postoperative days. The relationship between each cardiac preload variable and cardiac index (CI) was evaluated. A p value less than 0.05 indicated statistically significant differences. RESULTS: Each studied variable was not different between the two groups immediately after admission to the ICU. cRVEDVI had a linear correlation with CI in both group (NA group: r = 0.67, n = 216, p < 0.001; A group: r = 0.77, n = 42, p < 0.001), but RVEDVI had a poor correlation with CI (NA group: r = 0.27, n = 216, p < 0.001; A group: r = 0.19, n = 42, p = 0.036). IDVGI had a linear correlation with CI (NA group: r = 0.49, n = 216, p < 0.001; A group: r = 0.61, n = 42, p < 0.001), Cardiac filling pressures had no correlation with CI. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that cRVEDVI and IDVGI were correlated with CI in the presence or absence of arrhythmias. cRVEDVI and IDVGI have potential as indirect cardiac preload markers following cardiac surgery.
