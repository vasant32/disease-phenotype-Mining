A previously fit and well 40-year-old man presented to the emergency department with palpitations after suffering an 11 000 volt electrical shock from overhead power cables through a mobile crane which he was operating. His ECG demonstrated the presence of new atrial fibrillation at a rate of 80 beats per min. He was haemodynamically stable, and had otherwise only sustained a small exit burn to his left great toe. Routine blood tests including creatine kinase and troponin T were normal. A bolus of intravenous flecainide failed to restore sinus rhythm, but an amiodarone infusion was successful. An electrical shock is a rare cause of atrial fibrillation. There is no consensus over optimal medical management. Numerous treatment plans have been previously employed with varying degrees of success.
