We present a case of digoxin toxicity in the context of dehydration, renal dysfunction and concomitant use of the macrolide antibiotic, clarithromycin, which is known to inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux mechanisms of digoxin. A focused review of the literature is presented. Health care providers need to be vigilant of this mechanism of drug-drug interaction, which is also relevant to other commonly used cardiovascular drugs.
