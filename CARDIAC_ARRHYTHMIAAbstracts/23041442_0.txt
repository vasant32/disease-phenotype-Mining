Sleepwalking (somnambulism) is a sleep disorder classified as a parasomnia. Sleepwalkers develop motor activities that may be simple or complex: they can get out of bed, walk, urinate and even leave the house while remaining unconscious and unable to communicate. It is difficult to wake a sleepwalker, but it is not dangerous - as many people think. Sleepwalking cases have been caused by jet lag, the consumption of narcotics, sedatives and alcohol, cardiac problems such as arrhythmias, and other medical conditions, including epilepsy, asthma and apnoea. In a quick search of the literature, only one case due to hypoglycaemia has been reported, describing a patient with type 1 diabetes whose sleepwalking was triggered by nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Our present case was similar, and our report also describes how it occurred and how the condition was remedied.
