 OBJECTIVES: A very high percentage of patients submitted to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) develop symptomatic aortic disease requiring surgery upon ageing. The surgical risk of the redo procedure is controversial. We describe our recent experience with patients submitted to this surgery under such conditions. METHODS: From July 1999 to July 2010, 51 patients (mean age, 70.3 ± 7.0 years, 86.3% male) submitted to CABG previously required aortic valve surgery (AVS). The mean interval between the surgeries was 7.1 ± 3.9 years. Twenty-one patients (41.2%) had also undergone AVS during the first surgery [12 patients (57.7%) had valve replacement and 9 patients (42.8%) had valvuloplasty]. At presentation, 51.0% were in New York Heart Association Class III/IV and the standard and logistic EuroSCOREs were 10.1 ± 2.5 and 20.9 ± 16.5%, respectively. RESULTS: Aortic valve replacement was performed in 48 patients (94.1%). Two patients had undergone a surgery for the closure of a peri-prosthetic leak and one patient a valvuloplasty. Thirteen patients (25.5%) needed to undergo additional cardiac procedures, including root enlargement (three patients, 5.9%). Valve surgery was performed with non-dissection of the internal thoracic artery graft, when patented, and antegrade cardioplegic arrest of other territories. Hospital and 30-day mortality rate was 2% (n = 1). The mean duration of hospital stay was 13.0 ± 11.1 days. The most frequent complication was arrhythmias - in 25.5% of the patients, and mostly due to atrial fibrillation (19.6%). Permanent pacemaker for A-V block was required in 5.9% of the cases, stroke was documented in two cases (3.9%) and early re-intervention was observed in two cases. CONCLUSIONS: Redo AVS performed in patients submitted to CABG previously results in mortality and morbidity rates that are much lower than what is expected, bringing clear benefits to the patients.
