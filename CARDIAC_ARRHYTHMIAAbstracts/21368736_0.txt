Antiarrhythmic drug therapy will continue to play an important role in the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). Pharmacological therapy is focused on AF symptom relief and on prevention of tachycardiomyopathy. The choice between the various anti-arrhythmic drugs available, either for rate or rhythm control, mainly depends on the underlying cardiac disease, type of AF and possible side-effects. New anti-arrhythmic drugs in the guidelines vernakalant and dronedarone are promising, but further research is required to explore their role in treatment of patients with AF. In this review, we will discuss the role of antiarrhythmic drugs in management of patients with AF according to the new AF guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology.
