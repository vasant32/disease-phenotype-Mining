 INTRODUCTION: Serum concentrations of potassium (K) and calcium (Ca) influence ionic currents and play an important role in the duration of ventricular action potential. Further, the influence of alkalosis in reducing ionized calcium has been well known for a long time. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of different dialysate electrolytes and bicarbonate concentrations on changes of QTc interval in patients on chronic hemodialysis. METHODS: The study hemodialysis sessions were performed in 22 patients, with different electrolyte and bicarbonate concentrations in dialysate. Tested dialysate concentrations were K of 2 and 3 mmol/L; Ca 1.25, 1.5 and 1.75 mmol/L; and bicarbonate 30 and 34 mmol/L. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded 1 hour before, at the end and every hour for 4 hours after each study dialysis session. QTc interval was measured from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of a T wave on a 12-lead ECG. Blood was collected and K, total Ca, ionic Ca and pH evaluated. RESULTS: At the end of the study hemodialysis session with dialysate containing low K (2 mmol/L), low Ca (1.25 mmol/L) and high bicarbonate concentration (34 mmol), mean QTc interval was significantly prolonged compared with that recorded with dialysate containing high K (3 mmol/L), high Ca (1.75 mmol/L) and bicarbonate (30 mmol) (40 ± 10 milliseconds vs. 2 ± 2 milliseconds; p<0.01). Dialysate with low concentration of low Ca, K and high concentration of bicarbonate was an independent predictor of QTc; the combination of low Ca and K and high bicarbonate strongly increased the risk of prolonged QTc interval. CONCLUSION: The present pilot study shows that changes in QTc interval during hemodialysis depend on both electrolyte and bicarbonate concentrations in dialysate.
