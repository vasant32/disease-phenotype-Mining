 OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the entirely subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD). BACKGROUND: A new entirely S-ICD has been introduced, that does not require lead placement in or on the heart. The authors report the largest multicenter experience to date with the S-ICD with a minimum of 1-year follow-up in the first 118 Dutch patients who were implanted with this device. METHODS: Patients were selected if they had a class I or IIa indication for primary or secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death. All consecutive patients from 4 high-volume centers in the Netherlands with an S-ICD implanted between December 2008 and April 2011 were included. RESULTS: A total of 118 patients (75% males, mean age 50 years) received the S-ICD. After 18 months of follow-up, 8 patients experienced 45 successful appropriate shocks (98% first shock conversion efficacy). No sudden deaths occurred. Fifteen patients (13%) received inappropriate shocks, mainly due to T-wave oversensing, which was mostly solved by a software upgrade and changing the sensing vector of the S-ICD. Sixteen patients (14%) experienced complications. Adverse events were more frequent in the first 15 implantations per center compared with subsequent implantations (inappropriate shocks 19% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.03; complications 17% vs. 10%, p = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the S-ICD is effective in terminating ventricular arrhythmias. There is, however, a considerable percentage of ICD related adverse events, which decreases as the therapy evolves and experience increases.
