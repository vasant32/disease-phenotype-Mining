We present the case of a 21 year-old woman with unremarkable medical history except for tachycardia episodes. The ECG showed a delta wave pre-excitation by a left lateral pathway. One radiofrequency pulse temporarily terminated the accessory pathway conduction, revealing a nodal conduction with complete left bundle branch block.
