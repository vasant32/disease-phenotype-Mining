INTRODUCTION: Many patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) receive amiodarone. Amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism (AIH) may develop as a complication. We hypothesized that pulmonary vein (PV) isolation in patients with paroxysmal AF and history of AIH may yield a lower success rate. METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 704 patients who underwent AF ablation in our center between 2007 and 2010, we identified 20 patients (mean age 58.3 Â± 5.0 years; 11 males) with paroxysmal AF and overt AIH in the past. The control group consisted of 40 patients with amiodarone-refractory AF and no thyroid dysfunction. All patients underwent circumferential PV isolation. During redo procedures all tachycardias were targeted for ablation. During a 12-month follow-up, in the AIH group 6 (30%) patients were arrhythmia free after a single procedure, in comparison to 25 (62.5%) controls (P = 0.01). Atrial tachycardia (AT) was registered in 7 (35%) AIH patients and in 1 (2.5%) control patient (P = 0.001). AF recurred in 10 (50%) AIH versus 15 (37.5%) control patients (P = 0.2). Redo ablation was performed in 7 (35%) AIH patients and in 3 (7.5%) non-AIH patients (P = 0.01). During a redo procedure a PV-unrelated tachycardia was diagnosed in 5 (25%) AIH patients (vs 0 in the controls, P = 0.003). After the last performed ablation, 12 (60%) AIH patients and 28 (70%) controls had no recurrence, P = 0.56. AIH was an independent predictor of ATs. CONCLUSION: PV isolation alone has a lower efficacy for preventing recurrence in paroxysmal AF in AIH patients. After repeat ablations, overall freedom from tachyarrhythmias is similar to patients with no history of thyroid dysfunction.
