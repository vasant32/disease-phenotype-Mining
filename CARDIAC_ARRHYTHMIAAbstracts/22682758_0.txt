Our aim was to investigate the reliability of ultra-short HRV in patients with DM. A good correlation was found between the 1 minute and 5 minute parameters for maximal-RR, minimal-RR, average-RR, SDNN, RMSSD, pNN50, and total power. Also, a good correlation between 10 second and 5 minute parameters was found for maximal-RR, minimal-RR, average-RR, and RMSSD. We suggest that certain ultra-short HRV parameters can be used efficiently in DM patients for autonomic evaluation.
