 BACKGROUND: Renin and aldosterone are involved in an organ perfusion pathway that may be an estimate of disease severity. The primary objective was to explore the relationship between outcome and aldosterone and renin levels at medical intensive care unit (MICU) admissions in comparison to SAPS II scores. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted on patients admitted to the adult MICU during 12 months. Exclusion: subjects with creatinine >176 mmol/l, chronic arrhythmia and ACE-inhibitor therapy. Admission aldosterone and renin plasma levels were measured and SAPS II scores were calculated. RESULS: Eighty-two patients were included. Only the plasma renin median concentration difference between survivors and non-survivors was significant (P=0.0168). The area under the ROC curve for mortality and plasma renin concentration was similar to that of SAPS II. The correlation between mortality and renin >84 pg/mL showed an odds ratio of 5.78Â±3.45, P=0.003. CONCLUSION: Renin was correlated to outcome in critically ill medical patients.
