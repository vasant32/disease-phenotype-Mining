 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Among patients with Brugada syndrome (BS) and aborted cardiac arrest, syncope, or inducible ventricular fibrillation at electrophysiologic study (EPS), the only currently recommended therapy is an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), but these are not without complications. We assessed the total number of shocks (appropriate and inappropriate) and complications related to ICD in patients with BS. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-five patients implanted with ICD for BS in 6 Gulf centers between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2010, were reviewed. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator indication was based on aborted cardiac arrest (24%), syncope (56%), or in asymptomatic patients with positive EPS (20%). During a follow-up of 41.2 Â± 17.6 months, 3 patients (all with prior cardiac arrest) had appropriate device therapy. Four patients developed complications; 3 of them had inappropriate shocks. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, appropriate device therapy was limited to cardiac arrest survivors, whereas none of those with syncope and/or positive EPS had arrhythmias. Overall complication rate was relatively high, including inappropriate ICD shocks.
