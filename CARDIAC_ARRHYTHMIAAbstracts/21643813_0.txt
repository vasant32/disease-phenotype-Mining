With the development of interventional techniques and devices, transcatheter closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defect has been widely performed. However, there has been a lack of long-term follow-up results about postoperative ECG changes of PmVSD patients. We report our experience of early and late arrhythmias after transcatheter closure of PmVSD with a modified double-disk occluder (MDVO). We performed a retrospective review of 79 patients (47 males, 32 females) between September 2002 and May 2007 who underwent transcatheter closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defect. Symmetric and asymmetric PmVSD occluders were used. The diameter of the evaluated defects ranged from 3 to 12 mm, as measured by TTE and 3 to 15 mm by left ventriculography. Most cases of PmVSD were treated successfully with a single procedure, resulting in a successful closure rate of 97% (77/79 patients). There was no death in any of the patients. After the operation, 79 patients were followed-up for a range of 10-76 months (35.3 ± 17.4 months). In this series, 11 cases of incomplete right bundle branch block and five cases of complete right bundle branch block occurred during the early period after operation. During long-term follow-up, these issues declined in prevalence to five and four cases, respectively. Moreover, reversible third-degree AVB occurred during closure or after the procedure, and two of the three patients with reversible AVB received a temporary heart pacemaker implantation. These patients recovered 1 h, 6 days, and 9 days later, respectively. During 10-76 months of follow-up, no complications occurred in any of the patients, including residual shunt, severe aortic valve, or tricuspid valve regurgitation. Device closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defects with a modified double-disk occluder (MDVO) resulted in excellent closure rates and acceptably low arrhythmia rates.
