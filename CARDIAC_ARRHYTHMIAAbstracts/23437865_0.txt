INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical presentation and outcomes of pediatric patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT) originating from left heart structures. METHODS AND RESULTS: This international multicenter retrospective study including 152 patients (age 10.0 Â± 5.1 years, 62% male), divided into those with fascicular VT (85%, 129/152) and nonfascicular LV VT (15%, 23/152). All patients had a normal heart structure or only a minor cardiac abnormality. Adenosine was largely ineffective in both groups (tachycardia termination in 4/74 of fascicular VT and 0/5 of nonfascicular LV VT). In fascicular VT, calcium channel blockers were effective in 80% (74/92); however, when administered orally, there was a 21% (13/62) recurrence rate. In nonfascicular LV VT, a variety of antiarrhythmic therapies were used with no one predominating. Ablation procedures were successful in 71% (72/102) of fascicular VT and 67% (12/18) of nonfascicular LV VT on an intention to treat analysis. Major complications occurred in 5 patients with fascicular VT and 1 patient with nonfascicular LV VT. After a follow-up period of 2 years (1 day to 15 years), 72% of all patients with fascicular VT were off medications with no tachycardia recurrence. One patient died of noncardiac causes. In nonfascicular LV VT, follow-up was 3.5 years (0.5-15 years), P = 0.38. A total of 65% of these patients were free from arrhythmias. Two patients died suddenly (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The clinical course and outcomes of pediatric patients with fascicular VT and nonfascicular LV VT are varied. Catheter ablation procedures can be curative.
