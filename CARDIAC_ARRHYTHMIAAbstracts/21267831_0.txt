 BACKGROUND: Chaotic or multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) is a rare tachyarrhythmia in children, accounting for less than 1% of supraventricular tachycardia seen in childhood. The majority of children with MAT are healthy; a few may exhibit mild to life threatening cardiorespiratory disease. AIM: To report a new case of MAT revealed by a severe respiratory distress and cardiogenic shock. CASE REPORT: We report a rare case of MAT revealed by a severe respiratory distress and cardiogenic shock in a 12-day-old newborn. The echocardiogram demonstrated an isolated secundum-type atrial septal defect with a decreased left ventricular function. He was successfully treated with intravenous amiodarone. A relay by oral amiodarone and digoxine was made. Four months later, he had no recurrence of arrhythmia and left ventricular function returned to normal. CONCLUSION: Our case is original by its association to an isolated ostium secondum-type atrial septal defect and by the occurrence of a congestive heart failure revealing the arrhythmia and the structural heart disease during the neonatal period.
