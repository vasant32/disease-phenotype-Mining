MicroRNA cluster miR-17-92 has been implicated in cardiovascular development and function, yet its precise mechanisms of action in these contexts are uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the role of miR-17-92 in morphogenesis and function of cardiac and smooth muscle tissues. To do so, a mouse model of conditional overexpression of miR-17-92 in cardiac and smooth muscle tissues was generated. Extensive cardiac functional studies identified a dose-dependent induction of dilated, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmia inducibility in transgenic animals, which correlated with premature mortality (98.3Â±42.5 d, P<0.0001). Expression analyses revealed the abundance of Pten transcript, a known miR-17-92 target, to be inversely correlated with miR-17-92 expression levels and heart size. In addition, we demonstrated through 3'-UTR luciferase assays and expression analyses that Connexin43 (Cx43) is a novel direct target of miR-19a/b and its expression is suppressed in transgenic hearts. Taken together, these data demonstrate that dysregulated expression of miR-17-92 during cardiovascular morphogenesis results in a lethal cardiomyopathy, possibly in part through direct repression of Pten and Cx43. This study highlights the importance of miR-17-92 in both normal and pathological functions of the heart, and provides a model that may serve as a useful platform to test novel antiarrhythmic therapeutics.-Danielson, L.
