 INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) alone has been thought to be insufficient in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (PersAF). We hypothesized that preablation treatment of PersAF with a potent antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) would facilitate reverse atrial remodeling and result in high procedural efficacy after PVI alone. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy-one consecutive patients (59.4 ± 9.8 years) with PersAF and prior AAD failure were treated with oral dofetilide (768 ± 291 mcg/day) for a median of 85 days pre-PVI. P-wave duration (Pdur) on ECG was used to assess reverse atrial remodeling. Thirty-five patients with paroxysmal (P) AF not treated with an AAD served as controls. All patients underwent PVI alone; dofetilide was discontinued 1-3 mos postablation. In the PersAF patients, the Pdur decreased from 136.3 ± 21.7 ms (assessed postcardioversion on dofetilide) to 118.6 ± 20.4 ms (assessed immediately prior to PVI) (P < 0.001). In contrast, no change in Pdur (122.6 ± 11.5 ms vs. 121.3 ± 13.7 ms, P = NS) was observed in PAF patients. The 6 and 12 mos AAD-free response to ablation was 76% and 70%, respectively, in PersAF patients, similar to the 80% and 75%, response in PAF patients (P = NS). A decline in Pdur in response to dofetilide was the only predictor of long-term clinical response to PVI in patients with PersAF. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-treatment with AAD resulted in a decrease in Pdur suggesting reverse atrial electrical remodeling in PersAF patients. This may explain the excellent clinical outcomes using PVI alone, and may suggest an alternative ablation strategy for PersAF.
