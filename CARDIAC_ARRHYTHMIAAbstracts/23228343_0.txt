INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: An experimental model is used to analyze the characteristics of ventricular fibrillation in situations of variable complexity, establishing relationships among the data produced by different methods for analyzing the arrhythmia. METHODS: In 27 isolated rabbit heart preparations studied under the action of drugs (propranolol and KB-R7943) or physical procedures (stretching) that produce different degrees of change in the complexity of myocardial activation during ventricular fibrillation, use was made of spectral, morphological, and mapping techniques to process the recordings obtained with epicardial multielectrodes. RESULTS: The complexity of ventricular fibrillation assessed by mapping techniques was related to the dominant frequency, normalized spectral energy, signal regularity index, and their corresponding coefficients of variation, as well as the area of the regions of interest identified on the basis of these parameters. In the multivariate analysis, we used as independent variables the area of the regions of interest related to the spectral energy and the coefficient of variation of the energy (complexity index=-0.005×area of the spectral energy regions -2.234×coefficient of variation of the energy+1.578; P=.0001; r=0.68). CONCLUSIONS: The spectral and morphological indicators and, independently, those derived from the analysis of normalized energy regions of interest provide a reliable approach to the evaluation of the complexity of ventricular fibrillation as an alternative to complex mapping techniques.
