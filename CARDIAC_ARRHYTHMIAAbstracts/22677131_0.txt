 AIM: To assess the clinical and echocardiographic outcomes in patients referred for device closure of atrial septal defects in a tertiary referral hospital in Australia. METHODS: A prospective follow-up study was performed on all patients who had device closure of a secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) from June 1999 to December 2007. Clinical and echocardiographic data at the time of implantation and follow-up is presented. RESULTS: 176 patients were referred for shunt closure of ASD. All patients had a significant shunt defined as a shunt with right heart dilatation and/or a shunt ratio of at least 1.5:1. The majority were female (67%) and the average age was 36.5 ± 22.7 years; age range 3-84. The average hospital admission time was 2.5 ± 1.7 days. The average follow-up occurred at 3.7 ± 3.6 months for the first follow-up and 26.3 ± 18.2 months (range 3 months-7.8 years) for the long-term follow-up. Baseline echocardiogram findings showed the majority had a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (99%); average LVEF=63.2 ± 7.2% while the right ventricle was dilated in 61% of patients. Procedure information: The average procedure time was 94.8 ± 36.4 min. Procedural imaging was performed using Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) in 107 cases (61%); Intracardiac Echocardiography (ICE) in 69 (39%). Device use was as follows: Amplatzer=156 cases, Helex=18, and Starflex=2. Postprocedure shunt assessment by transthoracic echocardiography showed successful closure (no shunt or trivial shunt) in 99% cases. Two patients were referred for inpatient surgery due to a significant residual shunt in one case and an unstable device in another. One patient who had an unstable device had their device repositioned successfully. Atrial arrhythmia was the most common complication occurring in the peri-implantation period in 12 cases (6%) with four further cases at final up. The high prevalence of right ventricular dilatation in 65% patients at baseline had improved significantly at the first and long term follow-up to 2% (p=0.0001). CONCLUSION: Device closure of secundum atrial septal defects in this large Australian cohort demonstrates a high procedural success rate with a low incidence of complications in the short and long term.
