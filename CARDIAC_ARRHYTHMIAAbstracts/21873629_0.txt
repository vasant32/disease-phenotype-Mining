We describe a case of subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implant in a patient with an existing epicardial defibrillation patch. Potential issues with shock vector shielding were overcome by a modification of the generator implant site and poor sensing were successfully managed by programming a sensing vector which excluded the generator.
