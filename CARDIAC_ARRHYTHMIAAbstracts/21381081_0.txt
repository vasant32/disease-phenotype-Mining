Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice. Systemic inflammatory state, oxidative stress injury, and atrial fibrosis are identified as the main mechanisms for AF. Considering the multifactorial mechanisms of AF, a novel therapeutic agent with multi-bioactivities should be presented. Regular consumption of green tea has been associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease and against a large number of pathologic conditions. Recent results indicate that green tea extract, especially (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, could effectively decrease inflammatory factors secretion, antagonize oxidation, and inhibit matrix metalloproteinase activities. Inhibition of inflammation, modulation of oxidative stress, and targeting tissue fibrosis represent new approaches in tackling AF; therefore, green tea may be an innovative therapeutic candidate to prevent the occurrence, maintenance, and recurrence of AF.
