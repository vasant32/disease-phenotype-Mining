 OBJECTIVE: Atrial fibrillation (AF) surveillance using a wireless handheld monitor capable of 12-lead electrocardiogram reconstruction was performed, and arrhythmia detection rate was compared with serial Holter monitoring. METHODS: Twenty-five patients were monitored after an AF ablation procedure using the hand-held monitor for 2 months immediately after and then for 1 month approximately 6 months postablation. All patients underwent 12-lead 24-hour Holter monitoring at 1, 2, and 6 months postablation. RESULTS: During months 1-2, 425 of 2942 hand-held monitor transmissions from 21 of 25 patients showed AF/atrial flutter (Afl). The frequency of detected arrhythmias decreased by month 6 to 85/1128 (P < .01) in 15 of 23 patients. Holter monitoring diagnosed AF/Afl in 8 of 25 and 7 of 23 patients at months 1-2 and month 6, respectively (P < .01 compared with wireless hand-held monitor). Af/Afl diagnosis by wireless monitoring preceded Holter detection by an average of 24 days. CONCLUSIONS: Wireless monitoring with 12-lead electrocardiogram reconstruction demonstrated reliable AF/Afl detection that was more sensitive than serial 12-lead 24-hour Holter monitoring.
