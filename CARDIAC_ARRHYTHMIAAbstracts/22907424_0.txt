OPINION STATEMENT: Arrhythmias are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Despite recent technological advances in treatment, pharmacologic therapy remains the most common treatment modality for pediatric arrhythmias. The choice of antiarrhythmic agent, the duration of therapy, and the dosing schedule depend on multiple factors including the recurrence risk and the arrhythmia burden (the latter being determined by the hemodynamic effect of the arrhythmia), and the frequency and duration of episodes. As with all pediatric medications, consideration must be given to the drug formulation, palatability, adverse effects and adherence issues. There are very few randomized trials available to guide the choice of therapy for pediatric arrhythmias, and thus treatment options often reflect physician or institutional preferences. Although various classification schemes exist, we classify antiarrhythmic agents based on their primary site of action: atrial muscle/accessory pathway (class IA, IC, and III agents); the atrioventricular node (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, and class III agents); or ventricular muscle (class I and III agents). This type of categorization assists in the approach to treatment required for each type of arrhythmia encountered.
