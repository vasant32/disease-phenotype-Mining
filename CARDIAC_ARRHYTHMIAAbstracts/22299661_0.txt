 BACKGROUND: Electrolyte changes during dialysis affect corrected QT (QTc) and QTc dispersion (QTcd), a surrogate marker of arrhythmogenicity. The impact of magnesium on QTcd is not clear. METHODS: Twenty-two stable patients on maintenance hemodialysis were enrolled in this study. Each underwent two consecutive hemodialysis sessions at least 2 days apart, the first against normal magnesium dialysate (with magnesium at 1.8 mg/dL) followed by a low magnesium dialysate (with magnesium at 0.6 mg/dL). Pre- and post-dialysis weights, blood pressure, electrolytes, and 12-lead surface EKG were recorded. The QT interval and the QTcd were calculated before and after dialysis in both sessions. RESULTS: Of 22 patients, 16 were female. The mean age ± SD was 53.7 ± 18.0 years. The mean change of QTcd (pre- vs. post-dialysis) was 9.5 ms (p = 0.120) and 9.3 ms (p = 0.145) in low and normal magnesium groups, respectively. Using univariate analysis, there was a statistically significant decrease in the mean blood pressure, weight, potassium, magnesium, and QTc interval post-dialysis (compared to pre-dialysis) in both groups (p ≤ 0.049). Post-dialysis concentrations of sodium and calcium were unchanged (compared to pre-dialysis) but bicarbonate increased with both dialysate groups (p < 0.001). The mean change of QTcd was not significant pre- versus post-dialysis by univariate analysis in either group. Multiple linear regression analysis adjusting for pertinent factors did not change the results in either of the two groups. CONCLUSION: Using a low magnesium dialysate bath in hemodynamically stable hemodialysis patients without preexisting advanced cardiac disease does not significantly impact QTcd.
