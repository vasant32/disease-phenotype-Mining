 BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic non-cancer pain not only show reduced quality of life, but also chronic morbidity and increased mortality. However, little is known about prevalence and type of abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings in these individuals. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 100 consecutive patients (≥ 18 years) with chronic (≥ 3 months) non-cancer pain were examined prospectively using ECG recordings and a questionnaire [German Pain Society (DGSS); further questions]. Data were collected at the first and next two follow-up outpatients' clinic appointments. RESULTS: Participation rate was 98%. Of all patients, 26% had an abnormal ECG, while 5% of these patients had an abnormal ECG first at the follow-up when consuming a different analgesic regimen. Findings were QTc prolongation (16%), ventricular block (7%), artrioventricular block (6%), and atrial fibrillation (4%). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of abnormal ECG recordings should be considered in the pain management of these patients. General ECG screening in this population should be discussed. Future studies should examine a larger population to identify potential risk factors (e.g., medication).
