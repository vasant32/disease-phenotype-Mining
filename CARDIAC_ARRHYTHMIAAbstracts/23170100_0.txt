Left ventricular hypertrabeculation/noncompaction (LVHT) is an uncommon type of genetic cardiomyopathy characterized by trabeculations and recesses within the ventricular myocardium. LVHT is associated with diastolic or systolic dysfunction, thromboembolic complications, and arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias, atrioventricular block and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Herein, we describe a patient who presented with heart failure and wide-complex tachycardia. Echocardiography showed LVHT accompanied with severe mitral regurgitation. The electrophysiologic study revealed a fasciculo-ventricular accessory pathway and atrial flutter (AFL). The AFL was successfully treated with catheter ablation.
