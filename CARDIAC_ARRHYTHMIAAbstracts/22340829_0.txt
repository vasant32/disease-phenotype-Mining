Post-infarction arrhythmias are most often confined to scar tissue. Scar can be detected by delayed-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of pre-procedural scar identification and intraprocedural real-time image registration with an electroanatomical map in 23 patients with previous infarction and ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). Registration accuracy and cardiac magnetic resonance/electroanatomical map correlations were assessed, and critical areas for VA were correlated with the presence of scar. With a positional registration error of 3.8 Â± 0.8 mm, 86% of low-voltage points of the electroanatomical map projected onto the registered scar. The delayed-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance-defined scar correlated with the area of low voltage (R = 0.82, p < 0.001). All sites critical to VAs projected on the registered scar. Selective identification and extraction of delayed-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance defined scar followed by registration into a real-time mapping system are feasible and help to identify and display the arrhythmogenic substrate in post-infarction patients with VAs.
