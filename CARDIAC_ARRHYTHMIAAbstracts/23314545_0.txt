Although vitamin B6 and its metabolite, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), have been shown to exert beneficial effects in ischemic heart disease, the mechanisms of their action are not fully understood. Some studies have shown that ventricular arrhythmias and mortality upon the occlusion of coronary artery were attenuated by pretreatment of animals with PLP. Furthermore, ischemia-reperfusion-induced abnormalities in cardiac performance and defects in sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+-transport activities were decreased by PLP. The increase in cardiac contractile activity of isolated heart by ATP was reduced by PLP, unlike propranolol, whereas that by isoproterenol was not depressed by PLP. ATP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i, unlike KCl-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in cardiomyocytes was depressed by PLP. Both high- and low-affinity sites for ATP binding in sarcolemmal membranes were also decreased by PLP. These observations support the view that PLP may produce cardioprotective effects in ischemic heart disease by attenuating the occurrence of intracellular Ca2+ overload due to the blockade of purinergic receptors.
