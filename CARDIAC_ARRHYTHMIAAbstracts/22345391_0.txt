 BACKGROUND: The anatomic features of left atrial diverticula (LAD) are still unclear in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and morphological characteristics of LAD in patients referred for radiofrequency transcatheter ablation of AF with dual-source computed tomography. METHODS AND RESULTS: Dual-source computed tomography images were obtained in 214 patients referred for AF catheter ablation and 214 sex- and age-matched control subjects. Images were analyzed to determine the prevalence and morphological characteristics of LAD and their relationship with adjacent pulmonary veins and left atrial appendage. In AF patients 77 (36.0%) (95% confidence interval, 29.6-42.4%) had 90 LAD, whereas in control subjects 70 (32.7%) (95% confidence interval, 26.4-39.0%) had 81 LAD (P=0.551). In patients with AF, LAD locations were right anterosuperior (47.8%), left anterosuperior (8.9%), left lateral (32.2%), interatrial septum (4.4%), right inferior (5.6%), and posterosuperior (1.1%) walls, respectively. The mean size of LAD was 5.3±2.9×5.6±3.3 mm. The wall of the LAD was much thinner than that of adjacent left atrium (0.89±0.46 versus 2.39±0.83 mm). Most LAD were located close to a pulmonary vein or atrial appendage ostium, with a mean distance of 8.7-13.1 mm. CONCLUSIONS: LAD are common, with a prevalence of 36.0% in patients with AF, which is not statistically greater than that in patients without AF. Thin-walled LAD are more commonly located on the superior anterior wall of left atrium and close to common ablation sites.
