Postoperative tetralogy of Fallot patients, since the first corrective surgical correction in the 1960s, have borne a burden of postoperation arrhythmias and sudden death. This is confirmed to be secondary to supraventricular arrhythmias and predominantly ventricular arrhythmias. It is rare to have both types of arrhythmias in the same patient, which the index case developed. Attempts to stratify patients in groups to predict which patients are susceptible to sudden death and arrhythmias have not been unanimous, despite multiple retrospective and prospective analysis of this group of patients.
