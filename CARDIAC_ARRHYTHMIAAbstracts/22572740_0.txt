 BACKGROUND: Scar signal quantification using late gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance (LGE-CMR) identifies patients at higher risk of future events, both in ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, the ability of scar signal burden to predict events in such patient groups at the time of referral for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) has not been well explored. This study evaluates the predictive use of multiple scar quantification measures in ICM and DCM patients being referred for ICD. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred twenty-four consecutive patients referred for ICD therapy (59 with ICM and 65 with DCM) underwent a standardized LGE-CMR protocol with blinded, multithreshold scar signal quantification and, for those with ICM, peri-infarct signal quantification. Patients were followed prospectively for the primary combined outcome of appropriate ICD therapy, survived cardiac arrest, or sudden cardiac death. At a mean follow-up of 632 Â± 262 days, 18 patients (15%) had suffered the primary outcome. Total scar was significantly higher among those suffering a primary outcome, a relationship maintained within each cardiomyopathy cohort (P<0.01 for all comparisons). Total scar was the strongest independent predictor of the primary outcome and demonstrated a negative predictive value of 86%. In the ICM subcohort, peri-infarct signal showed only a nonsignificant trend toward elevation among those having a primary end point. CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial scar quantification by LGE-CMR predicts arrhythmic events in patients being evaluated for ICD eligibility irrespective of cardiomyopathy etiology.
