The Finnish national cardiopulmonary resuscitation guideline has been published as part of the Current Care, evidence-based guidelines series. This article gives a short overview of the main recommendations. Throughout, the guideline emphasises the quality of chest compressions. Intubation should be attempted only by a health care provider with adequate training and experience. Adrenaline and amiodarone are the only drugs used in cases of cardiac arrest. Patients at risk of cardiac arrest should be identified and preventative action taken. In health care facilities, do-not-attempt-resuscitation (DNAR) decisions should be done in advance for patients who would not survive from cardiac arrest.
