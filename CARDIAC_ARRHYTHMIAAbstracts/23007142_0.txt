 BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare cardiopulmonary responses, exercise adherence, tolerance, and safety of optimized high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) compared with moderate-intensity continuous exercise (MICE) in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFREF). METHODS: Twenty patients with HFREF (aged 61 ± 9.9 years) were randomly assigned to HIIE corresponding to 2 × 8 minutes of 30-second intervals at 100% of peak power output and 30-second passive recovery intervals and to a 22-minute MICE corresponding to 60% of peak power output. Gas exchange, electrocardiogram, and blood pressure were measured continuously. Cardiac troponin T (cTnT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were measured before, 20 minutes after, and 24 hours after HIIE and MICE. RESULTS: Cardiopulmonary responses did not differ between MICE and HIIE. Higher exercise adherence and efficiency were observed on HIIE with a similar perceived exertion and time spent above 90% of peak oxygen consumption compared with MICE. Neither HIIE nor MICE caused any significant arrhythmias or increased CRP, BNP, or cTnT. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with MICE, HIIE demonstrated a higher exercise adherence and was well tolerated in patients with HFREF, while still providing a high-level physiological stimulus and leaving indices of inflammation (CRP), myocardial dysfunction (BNP), and myocardial necrosis (cTnT) unaffected.
