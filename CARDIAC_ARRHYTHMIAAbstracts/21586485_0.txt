Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction is not uncommon in multiple sclerosis (MS) and is related to the involvement of the vegetative areas of cardiac innervations in the medulla oblongata. It has been suggested that this may contribute to the occurrence of sudden death in MS. In this case report, we present a patient with active relapsing-remitting MS who died unexpectedly due to the sudden onset of cardiac arrythmias. Post-mortem examination showed the presence of active demyelinating lesions in the medulla oblongata. As far as we know, this is the first case report clearly linking sudden cardiac death to active MS on the histopathological level.
