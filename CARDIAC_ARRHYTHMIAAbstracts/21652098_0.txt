 BACKGROUND: Left ventricular noncompaction is associated with arrhythmias. The indication for implantation of devices for primary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death in noncompaction is controversial, especially for patients without severe systolic dysfunction. The use of implantable loop-recorders to detect arrhythmias has not been reported so far. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of indications and results of implantation of loop-recorders in patients with left ventricular noncompaction. RESULTS: Loop-recorders were implanted in 3 patients with noncompaction and moderately or preserved left ventricular systolic function. The recorders revealed pauses N3 s, leading to pacemaker implantation in one patient, and tachycardia leading to radiofrequency ablation in another patient. In the third patient, no arrhythmias have so far been detected. CONCLUSION: From our limited experience we consider monitoring by a loop-recorder as a useful tool to detect arrhythmias in noncompaction-patients.
