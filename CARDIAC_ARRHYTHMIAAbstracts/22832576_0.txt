 AIMS: The purpose of this EP wire is to examine clinical practice in the field of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) management, with special focus on in-hospital diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-three European centres, all members of the EHRA-EP Research network, completed the questions of the survey. A dedicated strategy for OHCA management is active in 85% of the centres. Shockable tachyarrhythmias such as initial OHCA rhythm are reported in >70% of the patients in 64% of the centres. In-hospital therapeutic hypothermia was applied in >50% of the patients in 53% of the centres and in <50% in 47% of the centres. In the year 2011 90% of the centres performed >10 primary percutaneous coronary angioplasties (PCI) in OHCA patients. The survival rate, when the initial documented rhythm was shockable, was >30% in 42% of the centres, and conversely, was significantly lower when asystole or pulseless electrical activity was the initial rhythm. A favourable neurological recovery was reported in >50% of the patients in 13 (26%) centres and in 21-50% of the patients in 21 (44%). CONCLUSIONS: This EP wire survey demonstrates a favourable implementation in OHCA of an invasive management strategy, including coronary angiography/PCI and implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy, while therapeutic hypothermia appears to be underused.
