Automatic classification of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is an important subject for clinical diagnosis of heart disease. This study investigates the design of a high-efficient system to classify five types of ECG beat namely normal beats and four manifestations of heart arrhythmia, in twofold. First, we propose a system that includes two main modules: a feature extraction module and a classification module. Feature extraction module extracts a suitable combination of the ECG's morphological characteristics and timing interval features. Discrete wavelet transform is used to extract the morphological features. In the classification module, a multi-class support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier is employed. The parameters of this system are determined based on a trial and error method and its performance is evaluated for the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Extensive experiments on the parameters of this system such as classifier kernels and various types of features are conducted. These experiments show that in SVM training, the kernels, kernel parameters, and feature selection have very important roles for SVM classification accuracy. Therefore, most appropriates of these parameters should be used for SVM training. Then at the second fold, a novel hybrid intelligent system (HIS) is proposed that consists of three main modules. In the HIS, further to the two mentioned modules, an optimization module is added. In this module, a genetic algorithm is used for optimization of the relevant parameters of system. These parameters are: wavelet filter type for feature extraction, wavelet decomposition level, and classifier's parameters. Experimental results show that optimization improves the recognition system, efficiently, and HIS is more superior to the system, which as constant parameters.
