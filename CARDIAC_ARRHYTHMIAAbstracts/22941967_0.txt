 AIMS: Encircling ipsilateral pulmonary veins (PVs) isolation (EIPVsI) with the double-Lasso technique has proven to be effective to cure atrial fibrillation (AF). However, in this technique, PV mapping with circular catheters may miss a non-isolation of the PV carina. The purpose of this study was to reveal the incidence and clinical significance of a non-isolation of the PV carina after EIPVsI. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 81 consecutive paroxysmal AF patients (age 61 ± 12 years, 56 men), in whom EIPVsI was successfully performed in one encircling line with the endpoint of the demonstration of bidirectional conduction block between the PVs and left atrium (LA) with the double-Lasso technique. After a successful EIPVsI, pacing from the PV carina was performed and it captured the LA in 17 (21.0%) patients. During a mean follow-up period of 19 ± 13 months, AF recurred in 13 (16.0%) patients. A multivariate Cox proportional analysis revealed that a non-isolation of the PV carina after the EIPVsI was a significant predictor (hazard ratio = 3.91, 95% confidence interval = 1.13-14.16, P = 0.03) of AF recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary vein mapping with the double-Lasso technique did miss the non-isolation of the PV carina after a successful EIPVsI, which was an independent predictor of AF recurrence after the EIPVsI. Pacing from the PV carina may be required to confirm the electrical isolation of the PV carina after EIPVsI with the double-Lasso technique.
