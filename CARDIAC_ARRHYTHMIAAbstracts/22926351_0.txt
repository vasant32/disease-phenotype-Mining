 AIM: To analyze the importance of previously un-investigated (or not completely investigated) potential risk factors for new-onset intra-operative arrhythmias in general surgery patients, operated under general anesthesia. METHODS: In this case-control study the population consisted of all patients who underwent elective non-cardiovascular, non-thoracic surgery under general inhalation anesthesia during the period of 12 months in a secondary care hospital in Foƒça, Republic of Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and were classified according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification to class I or II. Cases (n=57) included patients with at least one episode of ECG-recorded arrhythmia during general anesthesia, and controls (n=90) were sex and age matched. RESULTS: Significant association was found between intra-operative arrhythmias and history of cardiac arrhythmias in the last five years (adjusted OR 43.5; CI 2.3, 820.1; p = 0.012). Synergistic effects on intra-operative arrhythmias were found for history of cardiac arrhythmias and history of abnormal ECG, as well as for history of cardiac arrhythmias and use of propofol for induction of anesthesia. CONCLUSION: The non-cardiovascular, non-thoracic surgery patients with history of arrhythmias and ECG abnormalities deserve special attention, correction of electrolyte disturbances and avoidance of propofol for induction of general anesthesia.
