The study included 58 patients with CHD and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation divided into 2 groups depending on thyroid hormone and thyrotropin levels. Group 1 was comprised of 24 patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, group 2 of 18 ones with subclinical hyperthyroidism. Control group consisted of l6 patients with CHD, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and normal thvroid function. It was shown that patients with CHD, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and subclinical thyrotoxicosis had T3 and T4 levels 92.6 and 72.5% higher than those with subclinical hypothyroidism. Subclinical thyroid dysfunction was shown to influence hemodynamic isoelectric parameters of the heart. Therapy of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in CHD patients with subclinical hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism with simultaneous correction of thyroid function increases the efficacy of anti-arrhythmic therapy up to 50 and 45.9% respectively.
