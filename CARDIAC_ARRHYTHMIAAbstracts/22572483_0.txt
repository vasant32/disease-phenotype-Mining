 AIMS/OBJECTIVES: Patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) often receive an adjunctive anti-arrhythmic therapy. We propose that an addition of spironolactone will reduce the number of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias and ICD-related therapies. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a multicentre retrospective study, 64 patients with ischaemic and non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy whose left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was <35% and with ICD were selected. Amongst these patients, 28 patients were on spironolactone and 36 were not taking spironolactone. The ICD interrogation data were analysed for a maximum of 12 months. Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to compare the study and control groups. The outcomes were: (1) the number of shocks/anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) episodes and (2) the number of episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) requiring ATP, non-sustained VT (NSVT), and ventricular fibrillation (VF) over the study period. The spironolactone group had fewer monthly, VTs (P=0.027) (requiring ATP). The two groups did not differ in the number of NSVT or VF per month. CONCLUSION: Addition of spironolactone as an adjunct to ICD therapy in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) reduces VT requiring ATP, but does not affect NSVT or VF per month.
