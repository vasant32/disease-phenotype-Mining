Syncope is a common complaint in clinical medical care. The etiology and mechanism can be complex. We report two cases experienced recurrent syncope to our emergency room without concomitant symptom. The image studies of both cases revealed apical neoplasms compress left common carotid artery with mediastinal lymphadenopathy and without cardiac/main artery trunk involved. After brain lesion, cardiac arrhythmia, and orthostatic hypotension were excluded, syncope related to vagus nerve involved was suspected.
