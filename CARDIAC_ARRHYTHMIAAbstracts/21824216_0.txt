Patients with congenital Long QT are known to have normal QT interval in symptom-free period and in the early years of life. Precipitating factors like surgical stress, interactions with anesthetic agents prolonging QT interval, and electrolyte imbalances can manifest with life threatening arrhythmias in congenital or acquired Long QT syndrome. We report a case of concealed LQTS manifesting under anesthesia and its subsequent perioperative course.
