AIMS: The association between premature ovarian failure (POF) and cardiovascular diseases has been investigated in a few studies, but none have looked at ventricular repolarization abnormalities in these patients. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the ventricular repolarization by QT dynamicity in patients with POF.METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 26 female patients (mean age 37.5 ± 10.1 years) with primary POF and 31 healthy female subjects (mean age 37.5 ± 9.0 years). The linear regression slopes of the QT interval measured to the apex and to the end of the T-wave plotted against RR intervals (QTapex/RR and QTend/RR slopes, respectively) were calculated from 24 h Holter recordings using a standard algorithm. QTapex/RR and QTend/RR slopes were more steeper in the POF patients in contrary to healthy control subjects (QTapex/RR = 0.184 ± 0.022 vs. 0.131 ± 0.019, P < 0.001; QTend/RR = 0.164 ± 0.021 vs. 0.128 ± 0.018, P < 0.001). Pearson's correlation analyses revealed a stronger negative correlation between oestradiol (E2) and QTapex/RR (r = -0.715, P < 0.001). There was also a moderate negative correlation between E2 and QTend/RR (r = -0.537, P < 0.001). Serum follicle-stimulating hormone level was positively correlated with QTapex/RR (r = 0.681, P < 0.001) and QTend/RR (r = 0.531, P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Our study results suggest that QT dynamicity is impaired in patients with POF despite the absence of overt cardiovascular involvement. Further studies are needed to elucidate the prognostic significance and clinical implications of impaired ventricular repolarization in patients with POF.
