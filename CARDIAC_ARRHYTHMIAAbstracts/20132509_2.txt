A 63-year-old man with frequent unexplained syncope was implanted with a second generation remotely monitored implantable loop recorder for continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. He had a subsequent syncopal episode and despite accidental destruction of his patient activator, vital ECG data from the event were transmitted wirelessly, enabling a cardiac arrhythmia to be excluded. This case highlights the benefit of remote monitoring in syncope assessment, as well as a transmission system that ensures prompt analysis of the ECG data and therefore rapid optimal patient management.
