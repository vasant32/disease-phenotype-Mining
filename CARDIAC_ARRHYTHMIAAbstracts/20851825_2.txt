We identified a heterozygous p.Arg2401His mutation of RYR2 by sequencing the DNA of a 7-year-old girl who was referred for catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). Using high-resolution melting assay, we have demonstrated a mosaicism for this mutation in her asymptomatic mother which illustrates the benefit of extensive genetic analysis in CPVT, in particular regarding genetic counselling.
