Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia associated with an increased morbidity and mortality, and much of the AF-associated morbidity is secondary to a five-fold to six-fold increased risk of stroke and thromboembolism(1). The stroke risk in AF patients is not homogeneous, but depends on the presence of other underlying clinical conditions(2). To aid decision-making for thromboprophylaxis, several clinical risk stratification schemes have been developed using various risk factors and clinical characteristics.
