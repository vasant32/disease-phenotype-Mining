This case report illustrates the case of a patient who developed recurrent strokes after a pace maker lead was inserted into his left ventricle. It was removed successfully by the cardiothoracic surgeons but he remained very dependent functionally. This case highlights the importance of always reviewing the electrocardiogram and chest radiograph after the insertion of a pacemaker as late diagnosis of this complication can leave the patient with significant morbidity.
