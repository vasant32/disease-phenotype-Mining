 AIM: To study the systemic levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) -7, -8 and -9 and their inhibitor TIMP-1 in cardiac arrest patients and the association with mild therapeutic hypothermia treatment on the serum concentration of these enzymes. METHODS: MMP-7, -8 and -9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) were analysed in blood samples obtained from 51 patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest. The samples were taken at 24 and 48 h from restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The biomarker levels were compared between patients (N=51) and healthy controls (N=10) and between patients who did (N=30) and patients who did not (N=21) receive mild therapeutic hypothermia. RESULTS: MMP-7 (median 0.47 ng/ml), MMP-8 (median 31.16 ng/ml) and MMP-9 (median 253.00 ng/ml) levels were elevated and TIMP-1 levels suppressed (median 78.50 ng/ml) in cardiac arrest patients as compared with healthy controls at 24h from ROSC. Hypothermia treatment associated with attenuated elevation of MMP-9 (p=0.001) but not MMP-8 (p=0.02) or MMP-7 (p=0.69). Concentrations of MMPs -7, -8 and -9 correlated with the leukocyte count but not with C-reactive protein (CRP) or neurone-specific enolase (NSE) levels. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that the systemic levels of MMP-7, -8 and -9 but not TIMP-1 are elevated in cardiac arrest patients in the 48 h post-resuscitation period relative to the healthy controls. Patients who received therapeutic hypothermia had lower MMP-9 levels compared to non-hypothermia treated patients, which generates hypothesis about attenuation of inflammatory response by hypothermia treatment.
