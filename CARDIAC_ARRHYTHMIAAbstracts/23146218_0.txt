INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Distension of the ischemic region has been related to an increased incidence of spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias following coronary occlusion. This study analyzed whether regional ischemic distension predicts increased ventricular fibrillation inducibility after coronary occlusion in swine. METHODS: In 18 anesthetized, open-chest pigs, the left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated for 60min. Myocardial segment length in the ischemic region was monitored by means of ultrasonic crystals. Programmed stimulation was applied at baseline and then continuously between 10 and 60min after coronary occlusion. RESULTS: Coronary occlusion induced a rapid increase in end-diastolic length in the ischemic region, which reached 109.4% (0,9%) of baseline values 10min after occlusion (P<.001). On average, 6.6 (0,5) stimulation protocols were completed and 5.4 (0,6) ventricular fibrillation episodes induced between 10 and 60min of coronary occlusion. Neither baseline serum potassium levels nor the size of the ischemic region were significantly related to ventricular fibrillation inducibility. In contrast, the increase in end-diastolic length 10min after coronary occlusion was associated directly (r=0,67; P=.002) with the number of induced ventricular fibrillation episodes and inversely (r=-0,55; P=.018) with the number of extrastimuli needed for ventricular fibrillation induction. CONCLUSIONS: Regional ischemic expansion predicts increased ventricular fibrillation inducibility following coronary occlusion. These results highlight the potential influence of mechanical factors, acting not only on the triggers but also on the substrate, in the genesis of malignant ventricular arrhythmias during acute ischemia.
