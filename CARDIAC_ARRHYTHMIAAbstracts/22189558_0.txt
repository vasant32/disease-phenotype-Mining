An increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) augments late sodium current (I(Na.L)) in cardiomyocytes. This study tests the hypothesis that both Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and protein kinase C (PKC) mediate the effect of increased [Ca(2+)](i) to increase I(Na.L). Whole cell and open cell-attached patch clamp techniques were used to record I(Na.L) in rabbit ventricular myocytes dialyzed with solutions containing various concentrations of [Ca(2+)](i). Dialysis of cells with [Ca(2+)](i) from 0.1 to 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 μM increased I(Na.L) in a concentration-dependent manner from 0.221 ± 0.038 to 0.554 ± 0.045 pA/pF (n = 10, P < 0.01) and was associated with an increase in mean Na(+) channel open probability and prolongation of channel mean open-time (n = 7, P < 0.01). In the presence of 0.6 μM [Ca(2+)](i), KN-93 (10 μM) and bisindolylmaleimide (BIM, 2 μM) decreased I(Na.L) by 45.2 and 54.8%, respectively. The effects of KN-93 and autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide II (2 μM) were not different. A combination of KN-93 and BIM completely reversed the increase in I(Na.L) as well as the Ca(2+)-induced changes in Na(+) channel mean open probability and mean open-time induced by 0.6 μM [Ca(2+)](i). Phorbol myristoyl acetate increased I(Na.L) in myocytes dialyzed with 0.1 μM [Ca(2+)](i); the effect was abolished by Gö-6976. In summary, both CaMKII and PKC are involved in [Ca(2+)](i)-mediated augmentation of I(Na.L) in ventricular myocytes. Inhibition of CaMKII and/or PKC pathways may be a therapeutic target to reduce myocardial dysfunction and cardiac arrhythmias caused by calcium overload.
