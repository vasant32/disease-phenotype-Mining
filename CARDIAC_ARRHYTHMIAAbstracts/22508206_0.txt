The present case report highlights that a tense mega-sized aortic root and ascending aorta can mechanically resist the passage of fully inflated (1.5 ml air) balloon to wedge-trace position in the pulmonary artery. Any attempt to push the catheter rather predisposed its recoiling and rebutting into the right ventricle and the cardiac arrhythmia. Inflating continuous cardiac output catheter balloon with lesser volume of air (1 ml) is suggested to overcome this problem.
