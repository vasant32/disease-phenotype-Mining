Hypothermia is one of the most common environmental emergencies encountered by physicians that can be associated with a variety of electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities. The classic and well-known ECG manifestations of hypothermia include the presence of J (Osborne) waves, interval (PR, QRS, QT) prolongation, varied T-wave abnormalities, and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. There are less well-defined and known ECG signs of hypothermia that, in fact, may simulate findings of acute coronary ischemia. We describe a case of hypothermia with associated ECG findings mimicking pericarditis. Especially interesting was the challenging presentation and several associated important learning points. Herewith, we also discuss some important ECG and clinical factors that may be used in differentiating the genesis of ST elevations.
