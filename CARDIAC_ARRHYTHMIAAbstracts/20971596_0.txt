Mexiletine is a class IB antiarrhythmic agent. Although it is primarily used in treating ventricular arrhythmias, recent indications for use of mexiletine include chronic and neuropathic pains. At high doses, mexiletine causes drowsiness, confusion, nausea, hypotension, sinus bradycardia, paresthesia, seizures, bundle branch block, atrioventricular heart block, ventricular arrhythmias, asystole, cardiovascular collapse, and coma. A 23-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with intentional ingestion of high-dose mexiletine. Despite decontamination and supportive treatment, his vitals deteriorated during the observation period; and he developed stupor and dysarthria. Patient then underwent hemodialysis. His vital signs and overall condition improved rapidly following hemodialysis treatment. In this case report, we aimed to emphasize hemodialysis as a useful alternative therapy for severe mexiletine intoxications.
