Sevoflurane postconditioning has been proven to protect the hearts against ischemia/reperfusion injury, manifested mainly by improved cardiac function, reduced myocardial specific biomarker release, and decreased infarct size. This study is to observe the effects of sevoflurane postconditioning on reperfusion-induced ventricular arrhythmias and reactive oxygen species generation in Langendorff perfused rat hearts. Compared with the unprotected hearts subjected to 25 min of global ischemia followed by 30 min of reperfusion, exposure of 3% sevoflurane during the first 15 min of reperfusion significantly improved cardiac function, reduced cardiac troponin I release, decreased infarct size and attenuated reperfusion-induced ventricular arrhythmia. Further analysis on arrhythmia during the 30 min of reperfusion showed that, sevoflurane postconditioning decreased both the duration and incidence of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. In the meantime, intracellular malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species levels were also reduced. These above results demonstrate that sevoflurane postconditioning protects the hearts against ischemia/reperfusion injury and attenuates reperfusion-induced arrhythmia, which may be associated with the regulation of lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species generation.
