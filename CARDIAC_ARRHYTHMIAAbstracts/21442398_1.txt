The purpose of this study was to report the feasibility and procedural technique of minimal or no fluoroscopy in the ablation of ventricular arrhythmias in the pediatric population. A retrospective review was performed of all patients <21 years old who underwent ablation of ventricular arrhythmias using three-dimensional (3D) mapping with no or minimal fluoroscopy at a single institution. Five patients underwent electrophysiology studies for ventricular tachycardia or frequent premature ventricular complexes. Three patients had right-sided arrhythmias, and two patients had left-sided arrhythmias. Electro-anatomic mapping with the 3D EnSite NavX system and radiofrequency ablation was used in all patients. No fluoroscopy was used in the patients with right-sided arrhythmias. The two patients with left-sided arrhythmias had 1.0 and 1.9 min of fluoroscopy, respectively. The mean procedure time was 168 min (range 95 to 270). There has been no recurrence at mean follow-up of >1 year. Three-dimensional mapping systems have allowed pediatric electrophysiologic procedures to be performed with minimal to no fluoroscopy in patients with challenging arrhythmias, including ventricular arrhythmias. The decrease in radiation exposure decreases the risk of long-term adverse sequelae resulting from radiation exposure, which is especially important in children.
