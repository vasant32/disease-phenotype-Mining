An 82-year-old female patient undergoing cardiogenic shock caused by atrioventricular junctional rhythm immediately after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is described. Pharmacotherapy was invalid, and subsequent application of atrial pacing reversed the cardiogenic shock. PCI-related injury of sinuatrial nodal artery leading to acute atrial contractility loss, accompanied by atrioventricular junctional arrhythmia, was diagnosed. We recommend that preoperative risk evaluation be required for multi-risk patients. Likewise, emergent measures should to be established in advance. This case reminds us that atrial pacing can be an optimal management technique once cardiogenic shock has occurred.
