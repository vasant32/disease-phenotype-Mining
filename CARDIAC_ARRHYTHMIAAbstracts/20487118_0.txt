Successful Induction With Progesterone and Radiofrequency Ablation. Verapamil-sensitive idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia in pregnancy is a rare diagnosis. We report a case of a primigravida female with new onset fascicular ventricular tachycardia that was managed with oral verapamil. Post pregnancy, the tachycardia was not inducible in the electrophysioplogy lab. Progesterone, a hormone associated with pregnant state, was used to successfully induce the tachycardia, which was ablated. This is the first reported case of an idiopathic ventricular tachycardia associated with pregnancy that could be induced later by recreating the hormonal milieu associated with pregnant state.
