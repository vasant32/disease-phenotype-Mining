The purpose of the survey was to evaluate physician's and authorities policies and clinical practices when using occupational X-ray during ablation procedures and device implantation. This survey shows infrequent use of lead gloves, radiation absorbing pads, and lead glass cabins, but increasing use of three-dimensional mapping systems to decrease X-ray radiation hazards. Digital fluoroscopy with decreased frame rate is not used by approximately one-third of responding centres.
