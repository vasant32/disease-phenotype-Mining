Ablation of atrial flutter (AFL) requires linear radiofrequency application; these procedures are usually performed via a femoral approach from the inferior vena cava (IVC). Congenital anomalies of this venous system may limit catheter ablation. This report presents ablation of an AFL through the azygous continuation and also reviews the prevalence of congenital IVC interruption among patients referred for AFL ablation.
