Ca(2+) waves were probably first observed in the early 1940s. Since then Ca(2+) waves have captured the attention of an eclectic mixture of mathematicians, neuroscientists, muscle physiologists, developmental biologists, and clinical cardiologists. This review discusses the current state of mathematical models of Ca(2+) waves, the normal physiological functions Ca(2+) waves might serve in cardiac cells, as well as how the spatial arrangement of Ca(2+) release channels shape Ca(2+) waves, and we introduce the idea of Ca(2+) phase waves that might provide a useful framework for understanding triggered arrhythmias. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled "Calcium Signaling in Heart".
