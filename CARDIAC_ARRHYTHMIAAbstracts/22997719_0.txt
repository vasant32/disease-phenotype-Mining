We estimated the risk of arrhythmic complications after the use of cardiovascular medications in a prospective study including 123 patients with arterial hypertension and recurrent atrial fibrillation. Dispersion characteristics of P wave and QT interval were studied in patients with left ventricular concentric remodeling, concentric hypertrophy, and eccentric hypertrophy. The role of therapy with beta-blockers. ACE inhibitors, and preductal in the reduction of the risk of atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmia was evaluated.
