We herein describe a case of a myocardial infarction, in which Lambda-like J waves were documented. The patient was referred to our hospital due to ventricular fibrillation. The twelve-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission showed prominent J waves in the lateral and precordial leads. Coronary angiography revealed 99% stenosis with a delay in the left anterior descending artery, 75% stenosis in the left main trunk, and possible ischemia in the conus branch. Our report addresses the possibility that ischemic J waves can be used as an important marker for lethal arrhythmias in patients with acute myocardial infarction.
