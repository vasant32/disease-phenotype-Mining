 OBJECTIVE: Eating disorders, in particular anorexia nervosa (AN), are associated with cardiovascular complications and risk of arrhythmias. In a recent published study, it was found that patients with eating disorders, especially those affected by bulimia nervosa (BN) and a history of AN have abnormal late ventricular potentials (LPs). LPs are electrocardiographic markers used in detecting abnormal depolarization and increased risk of arrhythmias. Given the paucity of knowledge regarding the affects of eating disorders on cardiac depolarization, our aim was to further explore LPs in patients with eating disorders. METHOD: The study group included 30 hospitalized patients with eating disorders (14 with AN, 10 with BN with no history of AN, and 6 with BN and history of AN). Signal averaged electrocardiography was conducted on all patients using the Frank corrected orthogonal lead system. RESULTS: No patient with either eating disorder tested positive for LPs. DISCUSSION: Hospitalized patients with eating disorders, medically monitored and treated for several weeks, had normal serum electrolytes, started to normalize their weight, and did not appear to be prone to arrhythmias associated with abnormal depolarization. The prognostic significance of LPs in risk stratification of patients with eating disorders should be further evaluated by large cohort studies and longer follow-up studies.
