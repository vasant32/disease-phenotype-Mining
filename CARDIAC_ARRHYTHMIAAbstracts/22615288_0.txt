Cardiac toxicity may be associated with drugs used for malaria. Torsades de pointes (TdP) is a well-known adverse effect of quinidine when used for atrial fibrillation. Intravenous quinidine doses for resistant malaria are 2 to 3 times higher than those used for arrhythmias. Among 6 patients receiving quinidine for malaria or babesiosis, 4 developed QT interval prolongation and 2 experienced TdP. Clinicians should be aware that recommended doses of quinidine for malaria carry a high TdP risk.
