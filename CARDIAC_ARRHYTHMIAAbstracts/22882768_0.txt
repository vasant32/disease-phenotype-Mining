 INTRODUCTION: The utility of inducibility test of atrial tachycardia (AT) in patients with longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation (AF; LPAF) is unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the significance of induced AT and the impact of their ablation on the clinical outcome. METHODS: In 194 patients with LPAF (>1 year) who underwent catheter ablation (pulmonary vein isolation with substrate ablation), an inducibility test was performed after AF termination. RESULTS: AT was induced in 108 (56%) patients (induced AT group); neither AT nor AF was inducible in 37 (19%, noninduction group). During 39 ± 21 months, AT recurred in 30 patients (28%), AF in 19 (17%), and no arrhythmia in 56 (52%) among induced AT group, although there was a recurrence of AT in 9 (24%, P = 0.68), AF in 6 (16%, P = 0.85), and no arrhythmia in 22 (60%, P = 0.42) among noninduction group (P = NS). Note that 10 patients with repeated ablation in induced AT group revealed 8 different and 2 similar recurrent ATs compared to the induced ATs at first session. The mean cycle length of induced AT that terminated by ablation (271 ± 64 ms) was longer than that without (249 ± 58 ms, P < 0.05). In induced AT group, AT recurrence rate in patients who achieved AT termination by ablation was lower than those without termination (5% vs 36%, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: ATs that are inducible after LPAF termination do not necessarily become clinical AT. However, patients who achieved noninducibility of AT by ablating slower cycle length of AT had better outcomes.
