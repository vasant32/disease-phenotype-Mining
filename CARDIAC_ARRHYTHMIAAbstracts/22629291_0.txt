Spontaneous spinal haematoma is a rare cause of sciatica. We present a case of a 73 year old patient, who was admitted to our department and suffered from spontaneous sciatica over 24 hours. During the examination, the patient presented undulating symptoms of paraplegia, varying from incomplete loss of power in the left lower limb to complete plegia. The patient presented multiple diseases like biological aortic valve replacement, diabetes, hypertonia in her medical history, etc. Due to an additional absolute arrhythmia she ingested a cumarine medication. The tomographic imaging revealed a spontaneous lumbar and cranial subarachnoidal haematoma.
