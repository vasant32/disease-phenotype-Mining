 AIMS: In patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) the pattern of atrial fibrillation (AF) episodes and the total AF burden, may be related to the efficacy of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). We evaluated (pre)-procedural factors explaining the long-term outcome after PVI, using a ring-shaped multielectrode ablation catheter [pulmonary vein ablation catheter (PVAC)]. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 120 consecutive patients with PAF were treated with the PVAC. The patients' histories were obtained by a questionnaire and the clinical charts. Follow-up was performed at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months with serial electrocardiogram, and multiple day Holter at 6, 12, and 24 months, as well as event recording in case of unexplained palpitations. At 1 year, 66 of 120 (55%, 95% confidence interval (CI) [46-63%]) patients were free of any left atrial (LA) arrhythmia without class I or III anti-arrhythmics after a single procedure. At 2 years, freedom from LA arrhythmia slightly declined further to 58 of 119 (49%, 95% CI [40-58%]). The only pre-procedural predictor of long-term success was a shorter duration of the longest episode of AF (hazard ratio (HR) 0.77 95% CI [0.64-0.92]). The only procedural predictor of long-term success was no need for direct current cardioversion (DCCV) for AF (HR 0.36 95% CI [0.21-0.61]). Since other characteristics in these PAF patients were very homogeneous, no further clinical predictors were observed. CONCLUSION: Freedom from LA arrhythmia after PVI for PAF with PVAC is 49% after 2-year follow-up, with little decline between year 1 and 2. Predictors of long-term failure were a longer duration of the longest episode of AF in the pre-procedural questionnaire, and a procedural DCCV for AF.
