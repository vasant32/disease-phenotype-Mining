 AIMS: Device implantation may be challenging in patients with venous abnormalities. The most common congenital variation--frequently associated with other congenital abnormalities--is described as persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC). METHODS AND RESULTS: The present case series demonstrates successful implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) lead implantation in the most common anatomic variations of PLSVC. All types of current ICD models (single and dual chamber, VDD, and cardiac resynchronization therapy devices) were used. Angiographic findings and implantation techniques (e.g. guiding and diagnostic catheters, wires, occlusion balloons, and rotation sequences) are presented in images and movie sequences. CONCLUSION: Device implantation in patients with PLSVC may be complex but a successful transvenous approach is possible in most of the cases. Careful imaging prior to implantation procedure is essential for understanding the individual anatomy and in order to choose adequate material and implantation strategy.
