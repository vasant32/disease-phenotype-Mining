 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pulmonary arterial stenosis is a relatively common complication after corrective operation of congenital heart disease. Unilateral stenosis of pulmonary arteries could result in decrease perfusion of affected lung, pulmonary regurgitation, or elevation of right ventricular pressure. Eventually there are increasing risks of right ventricular failure, arrhythmia, or sudden death. However we have limited data of pulmonary arterial stent in paediatric population as the treatment of branch pulmonary stenosis. This study aimed at validating the effectiveness and investigating complications of pulmonary arterial stent implantation in a single institution during mid-term follow up period. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 42 patients (50 stents) were implanted for treating branch pulmonary arterial stenosis. We used cardiac catheterization for comparing diameter after stent implantation directly and lung perfusion scan indirectly. We also investigated any adverse effect relating the procedure. RESULTS: Percent stenosis of stenotic lesions were decreased from 54.1±10.7% to 22.8±12.5% (p<0.001) and degree of decrement in affected lung perfusion was declined from 22.7±8.0% to 10.3±9.0% (p<0.001) immediately and lasts during mid-term follow up period. Complication rate relating the procedure was 12% (6 out of 12) and there was no mortality case. CONCLUSION: This series showed immediate and short term effectiveness of pulmonary arterial stent in congenital heart defects. We concluded that percutaneous transcatheter implantation of pulmonary arterial stent was safe and effective during short and mid-term follow up period.
