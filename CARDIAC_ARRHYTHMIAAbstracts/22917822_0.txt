Landiolol hydrochloride, an ultrashort-acting β1-selective blocker, is a highly regulated drug. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of this drug for cases of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with left ventricular dysfunction. Between September 2006 and August 2009, 32 patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of <40% underwent CABG. Two groups of patients, a group administered landiolol hydrochloride and a control group not administered this drug, were compared. The administration of landiolol hydrochloride was initiated at 1 μg/kg per minute (γ) after cardiopulmonary bypass in on-pump cases and after completion of all the distal anastomoses in off-pump cases. We observed no significant differences between the groups with respect to preoperative patient background or incidences of complications, except for postoperative atrial fibrillation. The heart rate decreased significantly 30 minutes after landiolol hydrochloride administration, but no change was observed in arterial pressure. No change was observed in other parameters; the hemodynamics were stable. The occurrence of atrial fibrillation during the intensive care unit stay (during landiolol hydrochloride administration) was significantly lower in the administration group. The difference remained significant after multiple logistic regression analysis; landiolol hydrochloride was the sole inhibitory factor.
