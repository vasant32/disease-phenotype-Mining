Very few cases of the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in pregnant women have been reported to date. We report the first case of the use of ECMO for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia with cardiogenic shock in a pregnant woman. A 28-year-old pregnant woman at 26 weeks of gestation presented with supraventricular tachycardia complicated with cardiogenic shock and fetal distress that was refractory to medication and electrical cardioversion. ECMO was applied, and it facilitated successful radiofrequency ablation.
