 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect and potential mechanism of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and antiarrhythmic peptide (AAP10) on rabbit ventricular arrhythmia. METHODS: Twenty-four rabbits were randomly divided into three groups (n = 8 each): control group, LPA group and AAP10 + LPA group. Using arterially perfused rabbit ventricular wedge preparations, transmural ECG and action potentials from both endocardium and epicardium were simultaneously recorded in the whole process of all experiments with two separate floating microeletrodes. The incidence of ventricular arrhythmia post S1S2 stimulation was recorded. Protein levels of nonphosphorylated Cx43 and total Cx43 were evaluated by Western blot. The distribution of nonphosphorylated Cx43 was observed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the QT interval, endocardial action potential duration, transmural repolarization dispersion (TDR) and incidence of ventricular arrhythmia were significantly increased and nonphosphorylated Cx43 expression was significantly upregulated in the LPA group. Compared with the LPA group, cotreatment with AAP10 can reduce the QT interval, endocardial action potential duration, TDR and incidence of ventricular arrhythmia (25.0% vs 62.5%, P < 0.01) and downregulate nonphosphorylated Cx43. CONCLUSIONS: LPA could promote the arrhythmia possibly by upregulating nonphosphorylated Cx43 and subsequent gap junction transmission inhibition. Gap junction enhancer AAP10 could attenuate the pro-arrhythmic effect of LPA probably by downregulating myocardial nonphosphorylated Cx43 expression.
