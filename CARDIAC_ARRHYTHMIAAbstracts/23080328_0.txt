Recently, a new technology for nonfluoroscopic 4-D catheter tracking has been introduced (MediGuide). This system allows precise catheter visualization on prerecorded conventional fluoroscopy loops. We report about the first experience in atrial flutter ablation using a MediGuide-supported ablation catheter. For successful ablation besides the 6 s for loop acquisition, no further fluoroscopy was used.
