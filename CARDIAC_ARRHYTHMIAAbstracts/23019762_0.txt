Ictal asystole may be a potent marker for epilepsy patients at high risk for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The use of inpatient long-term video-electroencephalographic (VEEG) monitoring coupled with simultaneous continuous cardiac telemetry is an important tool to detect ictal asystole as well as other significant ictal cardiac arrhythmias. In this paper a case of ictal asystole detected during VEEG is presented. Routine 12-lead EKG was normal upon admission. After antiepileptic medication was tapered, the patient had a typical complex partial seizure with oral automatisms at onset followed by secondary generalization. Ictal onset was noted in left temporal lobe with subsequent spread to the right temporal region. A 20 second period of asystole began just prior to the secondary generalization. During this admission the patient underwent a potentially life-saving pacemaker implantation. The use of cardiac telemetry and baseline EKG are suggested for patients admitted into epilepsy monitoring units as part of the standard epilepsy monitoring protocol.
