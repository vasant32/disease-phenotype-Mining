Elevated heart rate induces an increase in myocardial oxygen consumption as well as a decrease in oxygen delivery. Myocardial ischemia is double in patients with resting heart rate above 80 bpm, compared to those with heart rate below 60 bpm. In addition, angina during effort increases the risk of mortality, directly depending on the degree of angina. Thus, in patients with myocardial angina, reducing heart rate could decrease symptoms and improve cardiovascular prognosis. A recent retrospective analysis of the results from the BEAUTIFUL study provides new evidence on this topic and is discussed in this article.
