There has been recent interest in this Journal concerning the occurrence of profound bradycardia with impaired consciousness during insertion of intrauterine contraceptive devices or systems. Questions have been raised regarding the requirement for medication for reversal of the condition, the role of the nurse practitioner in the light of this, and the effects upon sexual and reproductive health care service delivery. We present three cases where this condition affected patients under our care and suggest that although very infrequent, it is important. Medication for treatment and staff trained to administer it should always be available.
