Background: Patients with congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) are at increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia, particularly during labour and the puerperium. Case: A 28-year-old primigravida with known LQTS underwent induction of labour at 41 weeks' gestation using a Foley catheter balloon and IV oxytocin. Vaginal delivery with passive second stage and outlet forceps was undertaken with early epidural analgesia to prevent tachycardia and psychological stress. The patient gave birth to a healthy female, and had an uncomplicated postpartum period under continuous electrocardiogram monitoring. Conclusion: Vaginal delivery with use of oxytocin for the induction of labour can be safely undertaken in patients with LQTS.
