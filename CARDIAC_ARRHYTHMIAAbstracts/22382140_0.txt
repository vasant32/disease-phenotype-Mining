Atrial fibrillation represents the most common form of clinical arrhythmia in daily routine. However, current therapeutic options are still limited and a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms is expected to contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies. The scientific field of microRNA research has received a lot of attention in recent years, especially regarding cardiovascular research. This article gives a brief overview of the most recent developments in microRNA research in the field of atrial fibrillation and atrial remodelling processes. Furthermore, the clinical perspective of microRNAs as new therapeutic targets and as potential biomarkers is discussed.
