Statins have been hypothesized to decrease ventricular arrhythmias through a direct antiarrhythmic effect. Clinical studies have demonstrated a clear reduction only in populations with underlying ischemic heart disease. This study was designed to compare the effect of statins on appropriate shocks between ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Patients with an ejection fraction 35% or less who received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and had follow-up for at least 1 month were included. The ischemic and nonischemic groups were divided into statin treatment and control subgroups and the occurrence of appropriate shocks was compared. The frequency of shocks was analyzed using negative binomial models to account for overdispersion of the "count" data (number of appropriate shocks) and an adjusted intensity rate ratio was calculated for statin use. A total of 676 patients were included, of which statins were used by 65% (329 of 506) of the ischemic and 42% (72 of 170) of the nonischemic groups. Occurrence of appropriate shocks was significantly reduced with statins in ischemic (13.4% vs 20.9%; relative risk 0.64, P = 0.028), but not in the patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Similarly, although use of statins lowered the intensity rate of appropriate shocks in ischemic patients (intensity rate ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.12-0.47), no such benefit was noted in the nonischemic group (intensity rate ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-4.40). In conclusion, statins reduced the occurrence and frequency of appropriate shocks for ventricular arrhythmias in ischemic but not in nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Larger, randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.
