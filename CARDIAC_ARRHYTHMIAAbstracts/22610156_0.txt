Primary cardiac lymphoma (PCL) is a rare malignancy that is sometimes diagnosed at later stages because it is not associated with specific symptoms. Although chemotherapy is the standard for treating PCL, the value of surgical resection is controversial. We describe two patients who were treated by surgical resection and chemotherapy. Case 1 is a 37-year-old man with a history of acute lymphocytic leukemia and shortness of breath, and Case 2 is a 70-year-old woman with general fatigue. Both of them were presented at hospital. In Case 2, arrhythmic syncope occurred and direct current cardioversion was performed. Echocardiography showed a massive tumor in the right atrium and disturbed hemodynamics in both cases. The restricted venous return was alleviated by emergency surgery. The pathology report indicated primary cardiac lymphoma that was regressed by post-operative chemotherapy. A massive PCL should be surgically resected to prevent sudden death.
