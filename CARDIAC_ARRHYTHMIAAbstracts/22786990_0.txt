Knowledge of the anatomy of the coronary sinus (CS) and cardiac venous drainage is important because of its relevance in electrophysiologic procedures and cardiac surgeries. Several procedures make use of the CS, such as left ventricular pacing, mapping and ablation of arrhythmias, retrograde cardioplegia, targeted drug delivery, and stem cell therapy. As a result, it is more important for physicians interpreting the results of computed tomographic (CT) examinations dedicated to the heart or including the heart to be able to identify normal variants and congenital anomalies and to understand their clinical importance. Abnormalities of the CS range from anatomic morphologic variations to hemodynamically significant anomalies such as an unroofed CS, anomalous pulmonary venous connection to the CS, and coronary artery-CS fistula. It can be important to identify some anatomic variations, even though they are clinically occult, to ensure appropriate preprocedural planning. Both CT and magnetic resonance imaging provide excellent noninvasive depiction of the anatomy and anomalies of the CS.
