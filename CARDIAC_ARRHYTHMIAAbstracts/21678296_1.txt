 BACKGROUND: Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is the main cause of death in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Implantation of an automatic cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) significantly reduces mortality of these patients. T-wave alternans (TWA) analysis is a relatively new method of SCD risk stratification. However, it's prognostic role in patients with ICD has not yet been fully established. AIM: To assess the predictive value of TWA in patients with previously implanted ICD. METHODS: The study included 67 patients with properly functioning ICD (54 men and 13 women, aged 62.2 ± 8.4 years). All patients underwent TWA analysis on the treadmill using the Cambridge Heart 2000 system. Results were considered as positive, negative or indeterminate. Each patient had at least 1 clinical control visit with ICD interrogation during the 12 ± ± 6 months of follow-up. The recurrence of sustained ventricular arrhythmias: ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) was analysed. RESULTS: No significant relationship was found between previous infarction (p = 0.810), aetiology (p = 0.768), LVEF (p = 0.413) or age (p = 0.562) and the incidence of arrhythmia during follow-up. The results of TWA were not significantly different between patients with or without VT or VF. The TWA analysis identified patients with arrhythmia recurrences with a sensitivity of 62%, specificity of 49%, negative predictive value of 81%, and positive predictive value of 28%. The TWA performance was better in patients with non-ischaemic than ischaemic cardiomyopathy (negative predictive value: 100%, positive predictive value: 75%). CONCLUSIONS: The TWA alternans was moderately effective for identification of patients with ICD and ventricular arrhythmia recurrences. The test was most useful for identification of patients with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy who are of low arrhythmic risk.
