 AIMS: Atrial Preference Pacing (APP) is a pacemaker (PM) algorithm that supports a continuous atrial stimulation instead of a spontaneous atrial rhythm to prevent supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. The role of the APP in the prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF) is still controversial. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of preventive atrial pacing on AF incidence in myotonic dystrophy type I patients during a 12-month follow-up period. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 40 patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (MD1) who underwent dual-chamber PM implantation for first- and second-degree atrioventricular block. After a 1-month stabilization period, they were randomized to APP algorithm programmed OFF or ON for 6 months each, using a cross-over design. The number of AF episodes during active treatment (APP ON phases) was lower than those registered during no treatment (APP OFF phases). No statistically significant difference was found in AF episodes duration between the two phases. During the APP OFF phases and APP ON phases, the atrial pacing percentage was 0 and 98%, respectively, while the ventricular pacing percentage did not show statistically significant difference (10 vs. 8%, P =0.2). Atrial premature beats count was significantly greater during APP OFF phases than during APP ON phases. Lead parameters remained stable over time and there were no lead-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these 12-month follow-up data, it is concluded that APP is an efficacy algorithm for preventing paroxysmal AF in MD1 patients who underwent dual-chamber PM implantation for atrioventricular conduction disorders.
