The research of biological activity of peptide geroprotector Slavinorm on the basis of calf aorta extract was conducted in experimental models of hypertension and chloride-calcium arrhythmia. The research results showed that in experimental model of arrhythmia in rats induced by pituitrin administration, intraventricular and intramuscular introduction of Slavinorm in therapeutical dose had caused to leveling of hypertension symptoms. That was expressed in normalization of blood pressure characteristics, body weight, heart and kidney weight. In the experimental model of chloride-calcium arrhythmia in rats inrtaventricular and intramuscular introduction of Slavinorm showed the ability to predict the arrhythmia development caused by the Calcium Chloride administration. The research results testify to availability of the medication research in the capacity of the medication for treatment of age related pathology conditioned by vessels impaired function.
