 BACKGROUND: Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD), despite an unequivocal clinical benefit, are known to have a complex psychosocial impact on the patients. ICD shocks and the resultant psychobiological changes are known to contribute to increased levels of anxiety, depression, and post-shock stress symptoms in these patients. Phantom shock is a patient-reported perception of an ICD shock in the absence of any actual shock; however, its pathophysiological understanding is poor. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of the University hospital ICD patients' database from June 2006 to April 2010 was conducted. A total of 38 patients with documented phantom shocks as cases and 76 age- and sex-matched patients with no phantom shocks as controls were selected from the database. Patient characteristics were analyzed for their potential association with the occurrence of phantom shocks. RESULTS: Phantom shock patients had higher prevalence of documented depression (31.6%), anxiety (23.7%), and cocaine use (42.1%). Additionally, patients who had previous ICD shock storms were more likely to have phantom shocks (39.5%; p = 0.001). More importantly, no phantom shocks were reported in patients who did not receive defibrillation threshold testing or past ICD shock storms. CONCLUSIONS: Phantom shocks are primarily observed in ICD patients who had prior exposure to traumatic device shocks and are more common in patients with a history of depression, anxiety, or substance abuse. A pathophysiological mechanism is proposed as a guide to potential prevention.
