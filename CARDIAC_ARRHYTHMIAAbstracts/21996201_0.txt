 BACKGROUND: The mechanisms of sudden cardiac death are difficult to recognize, but repolarization disturbances have been shown to be the cause. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the polymorphism of nitric oxide synthase 1 adaptor protein (NOS1AP) was related to the risk of occurrence of corrected QTc-interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias recorded on electrocardiography (ECG) Holter monitoring in kidney transplant recipients. STUDY DESIGN: The 75 adult first kidney transplant patients included 43 men with an overall mean age of 45Â±12 years (range, 20-68). Additional patient monitoring during the procedure and in the postoperative period consisted of a continuous ECG tracing recording and investigation of the rs10918594 NOS1AP polymorphism. RESULTS: We observed Transient QTc-interval prolongation during the perioperative period. NOS1AP genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. For further statistical analysis, we combined GG homozygotes and CG heterozygotes because of the small numbers available; therefore, only a dominant mode of inheritance was investigated. There were no gender differences in QTc-interval patterns. Analysis of variance with repeated measures revealed no interaction between NOS1AP and QTc-interval values taken at various times among the kidney recipients. CONCLUSIONS: The transplantation procedure may lead to dynamic repolarization disturbances, which may produce an increased risk of severe arrhythmias despite optimization of patient status. The NOS1AP rs203462 polymorphisms did not correlate with an increased risk of QT interval prolongation among kidney recipients.
