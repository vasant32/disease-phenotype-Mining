We describe the case of a 52-year-old male patient with a recently diagnosed hereditary haemochromatosis who was referred to our electrophysiology laboratory due to presyncopal spells during physical exertion. The electrophysiological study unexpectedly revealed a sinus node dysfunction as well as a Brugada syndrome--both diagnosed on the grounds of an ajmaline test.
