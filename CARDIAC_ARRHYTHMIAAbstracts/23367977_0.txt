Spiral wave meander is a typical feature observed in cardiac tissue and in excitable media in general. Here, we show for a simple model of excitable cardiac tissue that a transition to alternans--a beat-to-beat temporal alternation in the duration of cardiac excitation--can also induce a transition in the spiral core motion that is related to the presence of synchronization defect lines (SDLs) or nodal lines. While this is similar to what has been predicted and indeed observed for complex-oscillatory media close to onset, we find important qualitative differences. For example, single straight SDLs rotate and induce an additional nonresonant frequency characterizing the core motion of the attached spiral. We analyze this behavior quantitatively as a function of the steepness of the restitution curve and show that the velocity and the directionality of the core motion vary monotonically with the control parameter. Our findings agree with recent observations in rat heart tissue cultures indicating that the described behavior is of rather general nature. In particular, it could play an important role in the context of potentially life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias such as fibrillation for which alternans and spiral waves are known precursors.
