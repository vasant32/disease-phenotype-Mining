Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic used in the prophylaxis and treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive resistant bacteria. In recent years, several cases of vancomycin-associated immune thrombocytopenia have been presented as case reports, but the real incidence of this side effect is still unknown. In this report, we would like to present a case during which we confronted with a great dilemma: urgent removal of whole defibrillator system due to highly suspected infective endocarditis or leaving the defibrillator in place and simply switching vancomycin to another antibiotic agent and wait.
