The most frequent cardiac pathologies caused by electric shock are arrhythmias with a wide clinical picture ranging from sinus tachycardia to asystole. Cardiac mechanical complications secondary to electric shock have rarely been reported. Despite the use of electrocardiography and cardiac monitorization in evaluating dysrhythmias and in the patients' follow-up, there is still no consensus on how to assess patients against probable mechanical complications and how to follow up these patients. In this study, we have presented the rupture in the secondary chordae of the mitral anterior leaflet caused by low-voltage electrical trauma. To our knowledge, this is the first cardiac mechanical complication reported as a consequence of low-tension electrical trauma.
