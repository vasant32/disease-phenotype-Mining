Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia is the most frequent arrhythmia among young pregnant women. In case of failure of vagal manoeuvres, their management is preferentially intravenous infusion of adenosine. The in vitro contracturant effect of adenosine on myometrial fibres is known, but very few data are available about the in vivo effect during pregnancy. We report here the case of a 30-week gestational age pregnant woman treated successfully by adenosine for a junctional tachycardia. Adenosine administration was immediately followed by a preterm labour managed by calcium channels blockers tocolysis. Even if causal relationship remains uncertain, this observation is consistent with physiopathological data and should catch physician's attention when initiating this treatment.
