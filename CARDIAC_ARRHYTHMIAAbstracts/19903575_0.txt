We present the case of a 20-year old male that underwent a surgical ventricular septal myectomy at 8 months of age for symptomatic and drug-refractory obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Though he has remained asymptomatic since the operation, he now demonstrates findings of cardiac arrhythmia and left ventricular dysfunction. His case is of particular interest as it represents a detailed and lengthy follow-up from early childhood to adulthood. Recognizing the post-myectomy state as a potentially separate entity from non-operated HCM can promote an individualized approach to long-term medical management.
