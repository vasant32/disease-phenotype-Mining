We present a case of significant QTc prolongation with torsade de pointes in a female patient with a DDD pacemaker, who had been treated with an established dose of sotalol for two years. The most probable trigger factor of this adverse event was a strong emotional stress. The discontinuation of treatment with sotalol resulted in clinical recovery and QTc normalisation.
