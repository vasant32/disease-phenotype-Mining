 OBJECTIVE: Early readmission in patients hospitalized for medical congestive heart failure is common, expensive, and associated with a worse late survival. Our objective was to compare late survival in patients' readmission for congestive heart failure with readmission for other causes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS: Of 3654 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery at a single institution between April 2004 and June 2010, 3492 (96%) were discharged from the hospital before 30 days and analyzed. Survival curves by readmission reason were compared using the log-rank test. Multivariable analyses adjusted for patient demographics, known preoperative cardiac risk factors, and surgical characteristics. RESULTS: The readmission rate at 30 days was 13% (465/3492): 23% for arrhythmias/heart block, 12% for congestive heart failure, 40% for surgery related causes, 14% for infection, and 11% for noncardiac causes. Independent risk factors for readmission include age, gender, congestive heart failure, and cardiopulmonary bypass time. Eight percent (268/3492) of discharged patients died within the 6-year study: 14% in the readmission group versus 7% in the nonreadmission group (P < .01). Patients who had been readmitted for congestive heart failure had worse late survivals compared with all patients who had been readmitted for causes related to their surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Readmission within 30 days after cardiac surgery for congestive heart failure predicts late mortality. Targeted postoperative management may be warranted in patients with surgical congestive heart failure.
