 INTRODUCTION: Conduction block in the posterior right atrium (RA) plays an important role in perpetuating atrial flutter (AFL). Although conduction blocks have functional properties, it is not clear how the block line changes with the pacing rate, pacing site, and administration of antiarrhythmic drugs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty patients with typical AFL were enrolled. Pacing (110, 170, 230 ppm) from the coronary sinus ostium (CSo) and low lateral RA was performed. After 1 mg/kg pilsicainide (pure sodium channel blockade) administration, the pacing protocol was repeated. Conduction block was assessed based on a color-coded isopotential map and 20 points of virtual unipolar electrograms in the posterior RA using noncontact mapping. Block line proportion was defined as the percentage of length of the block line between the superior and inferior vena cava. The pacing rate-dependent extension of the block proportion was significant during pacing from both sides (pacing from the CSo: 59 ± 17% at 110 ppm, 69 ± 16% at 230 ppm, P < 0.05; pacing from the low lateral RA: 43 ± 19% at 110 ppm, 55 ± 22% at 230 ppm, P < 0.05). The block line was significantly longer during CSo pacing than during low lateral RA pacing at each rate (all P < 0.05). After pilsicainide administration, the block line extended further. CONCLUSION: In addition to pacing rate-dependent and site-dependent changes in the block line, pilsicainide further extended the block line length. This phenomenon explains the clinical observation that counterclockwise AFL occurs more frequently than clockwise AFL, and the mechanism of class IC AFL.
