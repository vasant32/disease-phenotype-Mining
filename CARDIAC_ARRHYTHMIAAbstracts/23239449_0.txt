A wide range of evidence implicates the brain as playing a significant role in ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. The mechanism is thought to involve the intermediary of the autonomic nervous system. Here we briefly consider possible mechanisms by which central neural processing may modulate the myocardial electrophysiology and hence the arrhythmia substrate.
