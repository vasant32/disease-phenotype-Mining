Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii is a recognized cause of endocarditis in dogs and human patients and has been associated with cardiac arrhythmias, myocarditis, granulomatous lymphadenitis, polyarthritis, and granulomatous rhinitis in dogs. Little is known regarding the mode of transmission or cellular localization of this bacteria following infection of a canine host. The aim of the current study was to determine whether erythrocytes may serve as a site of infection by B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii. In the study, we successfully demonstrate the invasion of canine erythrocytes by a B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii genotype III strain using an in vitro model system. Dog erythrocytes were incubated with B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii after which tubes were treated with gentamicin at 12, 24, and 48 h post-inoculation. After gentamicin elimination of extracellular bacteria, there was a gradual increase in intra-erythrocytic bacteria, as assessed by colony forming units per ml, at each collection time point. The largest recovery of intracellular bacteria occurred at 48 h post-infection. These results suggest that canine erythrocytes may serve in the maintenance of bacteremia due to B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii within an infected host.
