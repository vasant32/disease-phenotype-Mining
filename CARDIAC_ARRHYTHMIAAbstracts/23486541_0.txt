Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a primary heart muscle disease characterized by progressive myocardial loss, with fibro-fatty replacement, and high frequency of ventricular arrhythmias that can lead to sudden cardiac death. ARVC is a genetically determined disorder, usually caused by point mutations in components of the cardiac desmosome. Conventional mutation screening of ARVC genes fails to detect causative mutations in about 50% of index cases, suggesting a further genetic heterogeneity. We performed a genome-wide linkage study and a copy number variations (CNVs) analysis, using high-density SNP arrays, in an ARVC family showing no mutations in any of the desmosomal genes. The CNVs analysis identified a heterozygous deletion of about 122â€‰kb on chromosome 12p11.21, including the entire plakophilin-2 gene and shared by all affected family members. It was not listed on any of available public CNVs databases and was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. This is the first SNP array-based genome-wide study leading to the identification of a CNV segregating with the disease phenotype in an ARVC family. This result underscores the importance of performing additional analysis for possible genomic deletions/duplications in ARVC patients without point mutations in known disease genes.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 13 March 2013; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2013.39.
