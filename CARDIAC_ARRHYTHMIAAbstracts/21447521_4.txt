This survey assesses the current practices of testing defibrillation function at the time of the first implanted cardioverter defibrillator placement. Responses have been collected from 57 European heart rhythm management centres. The results of the survey show an extraordinary inconsistency in the approaches to defibrillation testing (19.3% of responders report no testing at the time of implantation). A policy statement on this topic would help to improve patient care and unify the procedure according to evidence based data.
