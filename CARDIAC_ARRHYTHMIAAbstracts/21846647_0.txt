Pulmonary vein isolation in a dual-chamber pacemaker patient using the pulmonary vein ablation catheter (PVAC) system resulted in perpetual induction of ventricular tachycardia (VT) during radio frequency energy application. Induction of VT was abolished by programming the PVAC-system to a pure bipolar ablation mode. Patients with implanted devices should be closely monitored when using the PVAC system in unipolar modes.
