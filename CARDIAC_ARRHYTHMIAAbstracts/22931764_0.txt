 OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of long-term exposure to carbon disulfide (SC(2)) on cardiovascular system of workers. METHODS: The concentrations of CS(2) were detected in the representative workshops with different exposure levels. The indicators related to cardiovascular system were tested in 633 workers occupationally exposed to CS(2), which included blood pressure, electrocardiogram, blood routine (blood RT), cholesterol (TCHO), triglyceride (TG) and so on. The data were analyzed by chi-square test and multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The exposure concentration of CS(2) for 389 workers was less than or equal to 5 mg/m(3), which for other 244 workers was higher than 5 mg/m(3). The maximum exposure concentration of CS(2) was 15.73 mg/m(3). There were no significant effects of CS(2) on the electrocardiogram, red blood cells, white blood cells, blood platelet, TCHO and TG of workers. However, the positive effects of CS(2) on blood pressure and negative effects of CS(2) on hemoglobin were found. The rates of high TCHO, TG and hypertension in male workers were significantly higher than those in female workers (P < 0.05). The rates of high TCHO, hypertension and sinus arrhythmia in older workers (â‰¤ 30 years old) were significantly higher than those in young workers (> 30 years old) (P < 0.05). The rate of sinus arrhythmia in workers with 1 - 10 working years was significantly higher than that in workers with more than 10 working years (P < 0.05). The rate of hypertension in workers with 1 - 10 working years was significantly lower than that in workers with more than 10 working years (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: There were no significant effects of CS(2) exposure on the indexes of cardiovascular system of workers.
