This EP Wire surveyed clinical practice with regard to the use of antithrombotic therapy in relation to device implantation (pacemakers, ICT, resynchronization therapy) and atrial fibrillation ablation in 71 centres-members of the European Heart Rhythm Association research network. The results of this survey show variation in clinical practice, but reassuringly some consistency with guidelines and consensus recommendations on the management of periprocedure (devices, ablation) antithrombotic therapy.
