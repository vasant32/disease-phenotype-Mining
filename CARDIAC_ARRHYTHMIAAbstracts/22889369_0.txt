Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a cardiac disease that affects the right side of the heart and causes ventricular arrhythmias. It is considered as the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults. However, risk and optimal management of ARVC during pregnancy and delivery remain unclear due to the small number of reported cases. Here we report a case of successful management of pregnancy and delivery in a patient with ARVC, who had a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia from her previous pregnancy.
