Background: Doubly committed Subarterial ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a specific anatomic type of VSD located just beneath the aortic valve. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of using minimal invasive perventricular device closure in managing this type of VSD. Methods: During Dec 2008 and Aug 2010, 34 Pediatric patients with doubly committed subarterial VSD who met the inclusion criteria for device closure were enrolled in this study. Perventricular closure was attempted using a unique design eccentric device under the guidance of real-time transesophageal echocardiography. Complications such as residual shunt, valve regurgitation, arrhythmias were all recorded in postoperative period and during follow-up. Result: Perventricular device closure was successfully done in 28 patients (82%). 6 patients converted to open surgical repair due to residual shunt >3mm (1 patient), more than mild degree aortic regurgitation (3 patients) and device mal-position (2 patients). Complete closure rate was achieved in 93% at discharge and 100% during 20 months follow-up. No severe complications such as device embolism, significant arrhythmias and noticeable valve regurgitation were noted during follow-up. Procedure induced trivial grade aortic valve regurgitation was noted in five (18%) patients after procedure while only one (4%) persisted during midterm follow-up. Conclusion: Perventricular closure of doubly committed subarterial VSDs appears to be a safe and effective minimally invasive technique with good mid-term outcomes. Â© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
