 OBJECTIVE: Describe how antihypertensive drugs are prescribed in France in 2009 and 2010 and assess the effect of the presence of cardiovascular disease on the characteristics of the treatment. METHODS: The French League Against Hypertension Surveys (FLAHS) are conducted among a representative sample of individuals aged 35 years and older living in France. For the 2009 and 2010 surveys, a sample of 2292 subjects who declared to take one or more antihypertensive drug has been studied. In addition to the details of antihypertensive medications taken the day of the survey, the personal history for cardiovascular diseases was compiled. RESULTS: Of the 2292 prescriptions with at least one antihypertensive prescription frequencies are: ARB (43%), diuretics (43%), beta-blockers (34%), CCB (26%), ACEI (26%), spironolactone (8%), central and alpha (7%), DRI (1%). The prescription is performed as monotherapy (42%), bitherapy (37%), triple therapy (16%) and quadruple or more (5%). When triple therapy is prescribed, there is an association ACEI or ARB or DRI+Diu+BB in 46%, and an association ACEI or ARB or DRI+Diu+AC in 30%. Cardiovascular disease is present or past reported by 24% of hypertensive patients: coronary artery disease (13%), heart failure (6%), arrhythmias (5%), stroke (4%), PAD (4%). The use of BB is more common in hypertensive patients who have coronary artery disease, heart failure and arrhythmia. ACE inhibitors are more common in hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease, heart failure or stroke. CCB are more frequent in cases of coronary artery disease or PAD. The ARB are less frequent in patients with coronary artery disease. CONCLUSION: The ARB, diuretics and beta-blockers are the most prescribed antihypertensives in France in 2009 to 2010. Cardiovascular diseases declared in 24% of hypertensives led to a preferential prescription of an ACE inhibitor or BB.
