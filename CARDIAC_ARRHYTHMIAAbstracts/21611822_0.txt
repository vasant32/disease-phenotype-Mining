We present the case of a 17-year-old competitive athlete with an asymptomatic left ventricular aneurysm (LVA). Echocardiography demonstrated hypoplasia of the septum and a large apical LVA. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected a very thin and fibrotic wall of the LVA. Due to the potential risk of rupture the LVA was surgically resected and the apex of the left ventricle was covered with a patch plasty. The patient had an event-free postoperative course. Because of the potential risk of arrhythmia, the patient was recommended not to participate further in competitive sport.
