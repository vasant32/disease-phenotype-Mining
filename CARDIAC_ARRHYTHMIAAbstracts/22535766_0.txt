Ghrelin is a GH-releasing peptide mainly excreted from the stomach. Ghrelin administration has been shown to inhibit cardiac sympathetic nerve activity (CSNA), reduce malignant arrhythmia, and improve prognosis after acute myocardial infarction (MI). We therefore investigated the effects and potential mechanisms of the action of endogenous ghrelin on survival rate and CSNA after MI by using ghrelin-knockout (KO) mice. MI was induced by left coronary artery ligation in 46 KO mice and 41 wild-type mice. On the first day, malignant arrhythmia-induced mortality was observed within 30 min of the ligation and had an incidence of 2.4% in wild-type and 17.4% in KO mice (P < 0.05). We next evaluated CSNA by spectral analysis of heart rate variability. CSNA, represented by the low frequency/high frequency ratio, was higher in KO mice at baseline (2.18 ± 0.43 vs. 0.98 ± 0.09; P < 0.05), and especially after MI (25.5 ± 11.8 vs. 1.4 ± 0.3; P < 0.05), than in wild-type mice. Ghrelin (150 μg/kg, s.c.) 15 min before ligation suppressed the activation of CSNA and reduced mortality in KO mice. Further, this effect of ghrelin was inhibited by methylatropine bromide (1 mg/kg, i.p.) or by perineural treatment of both cervical vagal trunks with capsaicin (a specific afferent neurotoxin). Our data demonstrated that both exogenous and endogenous ghrelin suppressed CSNA, prevented the incidence of malignant arrhythmia, and improved the prognosis after acute MI. These effects are likely to be via the vagal afferent nerves.
