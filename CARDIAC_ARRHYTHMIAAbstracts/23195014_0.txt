 BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality is extremely high among kidney transplant recipients (KTRs), particularly in the first months after transplantation. Few data are available comparing the cardiovascular profile between KTRs from living versus deceased donors. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of CVD in the first 2 months following transplantation, among 120 KTRs of living versus deceased donor organs. RESULTS: Left ventricular hypertrophy was observed in 65% of patients, coronary artery calcification in 30%, and cardiac arrhythmias in 46%. CVD was more prevalent among KTRs from deceased versus living donors: ventricular hypertrophy 87% versus 59% (P = .008); coronary artery calcification 42% versus 24% (P = .04); and cardiac arrhythmias 59% versus 39% (P = .06). Multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and dialysis vintage, showed graft donor to not be associated with the prevalence of any CVD (Î² coefficient 0.912, 95% confidence interval 0.276-3.012, P = .88). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the present study demonstrated an elevated prevalence of CVD among KTRs. Patient characteristics, mainly longer length on dialysis seemed to contribute to a greater prevalence of cardiovascular complications among KTRs from deceased compared with living donors on univariate but not multivariate analysis.
