Calcium recording from whole heart is an important technique to investigate role of calcium in cardiac arrhythmias. Intracellular calcium can be recorded from multiple locations using imaging devices and organic dyes or genetic probe (Tallini et al. PNAS 103(12):4753-4758, 2006) from whole heart. Here, we describe the optical apparatus and the method to record intracellular calcium transients.
