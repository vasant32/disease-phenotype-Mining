Ultra-fast-track anesthesia for cardiac surgery introduces risks to the patient that may be mitigated by transferring the patient to the intensive care unit with a secure airway. These risks include poorly controlled pain leading to catecholamine surges that result in arrhythmias, strain on fresh suture lines, and potentially myocardial ischemia. On the converse side, the patients frequently require titration of potent narcotic pain medicine that can lead to hypoxemia and hypercarbia in the immediate postoperative stage causing myocardial dysfunction. Finally, the economic benefit of ultra-fast-track anesthesia is questionable and until there is a complete cost analysis that includes operating room time, cost of ultra-fast-track medications, and compares the cost of reintubation and delayed surgical operation, it is difficult to weigh in on the cost benefit advocated in the literature.
