 BACKGROUND: Aspiration is a feared complication of anesthesia and is accompanied by increased morbidity and mortality. Rapid sequence induction (RSI) describes the preferred procedure to perform endotracheal placement of the tubus in emergency cases of patients with an increased risk of aspiration of gastric contents. For more than 50 years RSI has consisted of the application of suxamethonium for neuromuscular blockade because of its fast onset and ultra short duration. Due to the serious side effects of suxamethonium attempts were made to find better alternative neuromuscular blocking drugs, e.g. rocuronium, to perform RSI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this small clinical series RSI was performed for general anesthesia of ten pregnant women for Caesarean sections using 1.0 mg/kgBW rocuronium for induction and maintaining deep relaxation until the end of surgery. For rapid reversal of the neuromuscular blockade to a train-of-four (TOF) ratio of 0.9, the Âµ-cyclodextrin sugammadex was administered at the end of surgery. Major and minor side effects, such as cardiac dysrhythmia, anaphylactic reactions, hoarseness and postoperative nausea and vomiting were documented. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of rocuronium and sugammadex for RSI combines rapid onset and rapid reversal of neuromuscular blockades with avoidance of serious side effects and very comfortable conditions for intubation in all cases. Minor side effects such as hoarseness, throat discomfort (in up to 30%) and myalgia (10%) for up to 48 h were documented.
