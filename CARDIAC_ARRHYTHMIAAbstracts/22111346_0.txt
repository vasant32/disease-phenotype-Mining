Among 73 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy [ejection fraction (EF) < 40%, left ventricular end systolic volume index (LVESVI) > 60 ml/m2], 65 patients with large scar underwent left ventricular reconstruction (LVR) including scarred endocardiectomy against arrhythmia and 13 with 3 + mitral regurgitation (MR) mitral valve surgery [mitral annular plasty (MAP): n = 9, mitral valve replacement (MVR): n = 4]. Eight-year survival including 1 perioperative death (1.4%) was 773% without death due to arrhythmia. 69 survivors revealed significant improvement in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, and lefe ventricular (LV) function in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and EF. LV volume significantly reduced from 103.6 to 57.5 ml/m2 in LVESVI (44% volume reduction) [p < 0.0001]. Postoperative LV shape became significantly spherical [eccentricity index (EI) closer to 0], however, MR grade was significantly reduced from 2.0 to 1.6 (p < 0.0003). Freedom from all deaths including hospitalization for cardiac causes was 71.1% at 8 years. One patient required implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for spontaneous ventricular tachycardia (VT). Multivariate Cox's regression model showed that preoperative large left ventricular end diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) [hazard ratio (HR) 1.02], postoperative large LVESVI (HR 1.03) and preoperative high NYHA class (HR 3.05) were significant risk factors affecting all deaths including hospitalization for cardiac causes. Of 24 patients with 2.5 + MR, mitral valve surgery (MAP, MVR or MAP + LVR) demonstrated significant improvement of MR (3.6 to 1.3 in MAP/MVR and 3.5 to 1.0 in MAP + LVR) compared with isolated LVR (2.6 to 2.2), although, there was no significant change in LV volume reduction. Our surgical approach to ischemic cardiomyopathy revealed excellent long-term results without death due to arrhythmia. Risk factor analysis recommended earlier and more aggressive surgical approach to achieve both LV volume reduction, MR and arrhythmia control.
