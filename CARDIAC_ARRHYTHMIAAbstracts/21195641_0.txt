 INTRODUCTION: Cardiac arrhythmias are a major cause for morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing non-cardiac vascular surgery. REPORT: An implantable loop recorder (Reveal(®) XT) was used for continuous heart rhythm monitoring to detect perioperative arrhythmias in a 69-year-old man undergoing major vascular surgery for an infected aortobifemoral prosthesis. The Reveal(®) detected several episodes of asymptomatic new-onset atrial fibrillation postoperatively, associated with elevated serum levels of troponin-T and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide NT-proBNP). DISCUSSION: Continuous heart rhythm monitoring with assessment of serum cardiac biomarkers may allow early identification and treatment of patients at high risk of perioperative cardiovascular complications, in particular, cardiac arrhythmias.
