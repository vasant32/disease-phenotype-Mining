Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia worldwide, increasing in incidence with the aging population. Substantial morbidity and mortality accompany its diagnosis. Management should focus on rate and rhythm management, on reducing thromboembolic risk, and also potentially on targeting the mechanisms responsible for its perpetuation. Current antiarrhythmic therapy has only modest efficacy and substantial side effects, and anticoagulation regimes are cumbersome and require regular monitoring. Novel anticoagulants and antiarrhythmics hold the promise of improved efficacy and safety. This review covers current therapy for AF, major advances in pharmacological management and future directions for therapy.
