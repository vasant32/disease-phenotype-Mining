 AIM: We evaluated ambulatory patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy from the cardiovascular standpoint and studied the correlation between the results of electrocardiographic (ECG) findings, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), troponin T and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels and patients' North Star Ambulatory Assessment scores. METHODS: Fifty patients of ages 6-12 (8.9 ± 2.8) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Cardiac evaluation included electrocardiography, echocardiography and cardiac enzyme tests. RESULTS: North Star scores ranged from 6/34 to 34/34. Twenty-eight patients (56%) had ECG changes. The most frequently seen ECG abnormalities were short PR interval (14%, n= 7), right ventricular hypertrophy (16%, n= 8), prolonged QTc interval (10%, n= 5), prominent Q wave (10%, n= 5) and T wave inversion (44%, n= 22). In 10 patients (20%), LVEF was below 55%, troponin T and NT-proBNP levels were significantly elevated (P= 0.003 and P < 0.001, respectively). When North Star scores were compared to patients' age, enzyme levels, ECG and echocardiographic results, we discovered negative correlation with age (P < 0.001) and troponin T levels (P= 0.02) and positive correlation with LVEF (P= 0.02). CONCLUSION: Patients with North Star scores of ≤16 are more at risk of developing cardiomyopathies. Troponin T is a cardiac index that can be used for evaluating myopathic patients and it seems to be correlated with the proBNP levels and LVEF values.
