 PURPOSE: This study aims to determine the impact of preprocedural imaging using computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with 3-D reconstruction on procedural efficiency, efficacy, complications and clinical outcome in patients who undergo radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA) to eliminate atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS: In this registry, a CT (n = 161) or MRI (n = 37) was obtained prior to RFA in 198 of 333 consecutive patients (age 61 ± 10 years) with paroxysmal (172) or persistent (161) AF. Antral pulmonary vein isolation was performed in all patients using an open-irrigation-tip catheter with a 3-D electroanatomical navigation system. Procedural and clinical outcomes were compared among patients who underwent RFA with and without preprocedural imaging. RESULTS: The mean duration of the procedure (246 ± 47 vs. 242 ± 40 min, P = 0.55), fluoroscopy (47 ± 13 vs. 50 ± 10 min, P = 0.16), and total RF application (83 ± 27 vs. 78 ± 23 min, P = 0.17) were similar among patients who did and did not have preprocedural imaging. The likelihood of a complication also was similar (5/198 [3%] vs. 4/135 [3%], P = 1.0). A repeat ablation was performed in 95/198 (48%) and 61/135 (45%) of the patients who did and did not have imaging study, respectively (P = 0.62). At 22 ± 9 months, after a mean of 2 ± 1 procedures, 140/198 (71%) and 101/135 (75%) of the patients who did and did not have preprocedural imaging were in sinus rhythm (P = 0.4). CONCLUSIONS: Preprocedural awareness of pulmonary venous and left atrial anatomy does not appear to have an effect on procedural efficiency or clinical outcomes in patients who undergo catheter ablation for AF.
