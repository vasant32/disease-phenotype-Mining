 INTRODUCTION: The Hansen Robotic system has been utilized in ablation procedures for atrial fibrillation (AF). However, because of the lack of tactile feedback and the rigidity of the robotic sheath, this approach could result in higher risk of complications. This worldwide survey reports a multicenter experience on the methodology, efficacy, and safety of the Hansen system in AF ablations. METHODS AND RESULTS: A questionnaire addressing questions on patient's demographics, procedural parameters, ablation success rate and safety information was sent to all centers where more than 50 robotic AF ablation cases have been performed. From June 2007 to December 2009, 1,728 procedures were performed at 12 centers utilizing the Hansen robotic navigation technology. The overall complication rate was 4.7% and the success rate was 67.1% after 18 Â± 4 months of follow-up. In 5 low volume centers there appeared to be a learning curve of about 50 cases (complication rate 11.2% for the first 50 cases vs 3.7% for the 51-100 cases; P = 0.044) and a trend showing a decrease of complication rate with increasing case volume. However, in the remaining 7 centers no learning curve was present and the complication rate was stable over time (3.7% for the first 50 cases vs 3.6% for the 51st case thereafter; P = 0.942). CONCLUSION: The Hansen robotic system can be used for AF ablation safely. In low volume centers, there appeared to be a learning curve of the first 50 cases after which the complication rate decreased. With a higher case volume, the success rate increased.
