 INTRODUCTION: Effectiveness of antral pulmonary vein isolation (PVAI) and ablation of non-PV triggers (non-PVTA) in controlling longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) has not been reported. We sought to describe clinical outcomes with this ablation strategy in patients (pts) followed for at least 1 year. METHODS: Two hundred pts underwent PVAI for longstanding persistent AF and were followed for recurrence. Thirty-three pts with <1-year follow-up and 37 pts with additional RF atrial ablation were excluded, leaving 130 pts for analysis. RESULTS: All 130 pts (108 men, mean LA 4.7 ± 0.6 cm, mean AF duration of 38 ± 44 months) underwent PVAI with entrance/exit block. In addition, 24 pts (15 pts during the initial procedure and 9 additional pts at repeat ablations) had 40 non-PVTA, including 3 with AVNRT. During follow-up, atrial flutter (AFL) was noted in 7 (5%) pts. The AF-free survival after single procedure without antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) was 38%. Repeat AF or AFL ablation was performed in 37 pts (28%) with PV reconnection uniformly identified (3.7 ± 0.5 veins/pt). During mean follow-up of 41.1 ± 23.8 months (range 12-103 months), 85/130 pts (65%) were in sinus rhythm with 65 pts (50%) off AAD, 20 pts (15%) on AAD. Additionally, 9 pts (7%) have had rare episodes of AF such that 72% of pts have had good long-term clinical outcome. Of the 36 pts with recurrent AF, 20 pts have not had a repeat procedure. CONCLUSIONS: PVAI with non-PVTA for longstanding persistent AF provides good long-term AF control in over 70% of patients with infrequent (5%) AFL. AAD therapy and repeat PVAI may be required for this optimal outcome.
