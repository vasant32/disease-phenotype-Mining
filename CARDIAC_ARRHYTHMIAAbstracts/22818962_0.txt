 BACKGROUND: We aimed to reveal late clinical features of patients with pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA/IVS) or critical pulmonary stenosis (cPS) after biventricular repair (BVR) based on preoperative right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic volume (RVEDV) findings. METHODS: Since 1985, 23 of 73 patients with PA/IVS (n=22) or cPS (n=1) with a tripartite RV and without major sinusoidal communication underwent BVR with a hybrid approach. The mean age and weight at BVR were 1.4±2.1 years and 6.9±5.9 kg, respectively. Mean follow-up was 10.1±6.4 years (range, 1.1 to 24.6 years). RESULTS: Overall survival, reintervention-free, and arrhythmia-free rates at 20 years were 90.6%, 75.4%, and 50.4%, respectively. In 19 patients with preoperative RVEDV of 60% to 120% of normal, echocardiography at 10 years after BVR showed well-maintained RV systolic function. However, RV volume was quantitatively dilated in 16 (88.9%) due to moderate or greater tricuspid regurgitation in 8 (44.4%), pulmonary regurgitation in 12 (66.7%), or both, which caused arrhythmia in 3 patients more than 10 years after BVR. Two patients with preoperative RVEDV of greater than 120% of normal required tricuspid valve replacement after BVR, after which refractory atrial tachyarrhythmia developed in both patients. Furthermore, 2 patients with preoperative RVEDV of less than 60% of normal showed a cardiac index value within 2.5 L/min/m2 at 1 year after BVR, which did not improve. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PA/IVS or cPS and adequately sized RV showed good late clinical features after BVR. However, long-term follow-up examinations are necessary for RV dilatation and late-onset arrhythmia.
