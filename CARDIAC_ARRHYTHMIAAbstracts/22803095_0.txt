The development of heart activity and its relationship with respiratory and motor activities were studied in rat fetuses with preserved placental circulation on gestation days 15-20 (E15-20) and in newborn rats (P0). During the studied period, the heart rate in fetuses increased from 175.93±6.10 bpm (E15) to 271.82±5.93 bpm (E20). After birth, the heart rate decreased to 220.94±8.73 bpm. Heart rate variability in the decasecond and near-minute ranges was detected. At E16 stage it is presented by slow regular oscillations lasting for 20-35 sec with an amplitude of 10-45 msec. Comparison of functional activities of the cardiac and somatic motor systems showed that at E16, fluctuations in heart rate are independent of the bouts of motor excitation. During growing, the degree of synchronization of heart rate variability with physical activity increased. E17-18 stage is characterized by short-term episodes of heart rate deceleration associated with motor activity; their duration and amplitude did not depend much on the force of movement. At E19-20, decelerations typical of early gestation terms were replaced by acceleration-type reactions typical for mature organism, which is related to maturation of coordination function of the nervous system. In the heart rhythm, respiratory arrhythmia appears during episodes of rhythmic breathing. Newborn rats demonstrated acceleration episodes; their parameters depend on the force of motor bouts; respiratory arrhythmia was not observed.
