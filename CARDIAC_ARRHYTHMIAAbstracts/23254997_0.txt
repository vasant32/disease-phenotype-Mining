Cardiac fibrosis is an important pathological feature of structural remodeling which contributes to ventricular stiffness, diastolic dysfunction and arrhythmia (Creemers and Pinto, 2011; Weber, 1997). It is also a hallmark feature of left ventricular hypertrophy induced by pressure overload. The molecular and cellular basis for fibrosis is an uncontrolled accumulation of collagens and other ECM components include matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), fibronectin (Fn), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), etc., in the interstitium and in perivascular regions of the heart (Espira and Czubryt, 2009; Iwamoto et al., 2010; Krenning et al., 2010; Leask, 2010; Muro et al., 2008; Spinale et al., 2000).
