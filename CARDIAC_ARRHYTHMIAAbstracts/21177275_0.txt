A 61-year-old male patient underwent an electrophysiological study and ablation for symptomatic atypical atrial flutter which was most likely related to previous intraoperative cryoablation for treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation during open heart surgery. During the procedure, a tachycardia was induced in the electrically isolated left inferior pulmonary vein (PV). With the routine induction protocol, perimitral flutter was induced, whereas, independently, the PV tachycardia was still maintained. After ablation of the mitral isthmus, no tachycardias were inducible anymore.
