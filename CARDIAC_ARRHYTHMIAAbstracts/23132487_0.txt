Dermatomyositis is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy with involvement of muscle, skin and other organs. Valvular heart disease increases the risk of perioperative adverse cardiac events. Only a little information is available about the anaesthetic management of a patient with dermatomyositis and valvular heart disease. Here we considered combined spinal-epidural technique for total abdominal hysterectomy, minimizing the risk of delayed recovery from muscle relaxants, aspiration pneumonitis, arrhythmias and cardiac failure.
