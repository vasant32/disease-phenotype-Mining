 OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the effect of 6% hydroxyl ethyl starch solution with 4% gelatin and Ringer's solutions on the haemodynamic stability of patients after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and immediately after discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). METHODS: This was a randomised, double-blind clinical trial of 92 patients who were candidates for on-pump CABG. After discontinuation of CPB, all patients were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and divided randomly into three groups. The first group received Ringer's solution, the second group 4% gelatin, and the third 6% hydroxyl ethyl starch (HES) solution (Voluven). Haemodynamic parameters such as heart rate, mean arterial pressure, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, central venous pressure, cardiac output and the presence of arrhythmias were documented. RESULTS: The volume needed for maintaining normal blood pressure and central venous pressure in the range of 10-14 mmHg was less in the HES group than in the other groups. The volume was similar however in the gelatin and Ringer's groups in the first 24 hours after surgery. Urinary output in the first four and 24 hours after surgery were significantly higher in the HES group than in the other two groups. Mean creatinine levels were significantly lower in the HES group. CONCLUSION: HES (6%) had a better volume-expanding effect than gelatin (4%) and Ringer's solutions, and its short-term effects on renal function were also better than gelatin and Ringer's solutions.
