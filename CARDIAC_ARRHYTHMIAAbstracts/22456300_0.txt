 OBJECTIVE: This thorough QT/ QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) study was designed to assess the potential of semagacestat, a functional gamma-secretase inhibitor, to delay cardiac repolarization. METHODS: In this Phase I, single-dose, randomized, 4-period crossover study, semagacestat was compared with placebo in 54 healthy male and female subjects between the ages of 19 and 63 years, inclusive. Each study period included single oral-dose administrations of semagacestat 140 mg, semagacestat 280 mg, moxifloxacin 400 mg, or placebo. Study subjects and the investigator were blinded to the identity of semagacestat and placebo; however, moxifloxacin was administered as open-label. Moxifloxacin was compared with placebo for assay sensitivity analysis. Pharmacokinetic parameters were also assessed. RESULTS: For each QTc, the upper bound of the 2-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the least squares mean difference between semagacestat (at both the 140- and 280-mg dose levels) and placebo was < 10 msec at all time points, and thus, within the limits set for clinical relevance in regulatory guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that single doses of 140 and 280 mg semagacestat did not prolong QTc to a clinically significant degree.
