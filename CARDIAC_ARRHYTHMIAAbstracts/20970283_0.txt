 PURPOSES: We aimed to evaluate the Global Registry of Acute Cardiac Events (GRACE) and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) scores in patients with suspected but not proven acute coronary syndrome (ACS). BASIC PROCEDURES: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the RATPAC trial. Standardized data were collected from 2263 patients presenting to 6 emergency departments with suspected but not proven ACS. Patients were followed up by record review and postal questionnaire at 30 and 90 days after recruitment to identify major adverse events, defined as death, emergency revascularization, life-threatening arrhythmia, hospitalization for ACS, or nonfatal acute myocardial infarction (AMI). MAIN FINDINGS: Data were available for 2243 patients (mean age, 54.5 years; 58% male). The major adverse event rate was 43 (2%) of 2243 after 30 days and 62 (3%) of 2243 after 90 days. The c statistics for 30-day events were 0.717 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.698-0.735) for GRACE and 0.682 (95% CI, 0.662-0.701) for TIMI. The corresponding 90-day c statistics were 0.726 (95% CI, 0.707-0.745) for GRACE and 0.693 (95% CI, 0.674-0.712) for TIMI. The c statistic for patient age alone was 0.656 for 30-day events and 0.689 for 90-day events. PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS: The GRACE and TIMI scores are little better than age alone as predictors of major adverse events in patients with suspected but not proven ACS, and thus add little to prognostic assessment of such patients.
