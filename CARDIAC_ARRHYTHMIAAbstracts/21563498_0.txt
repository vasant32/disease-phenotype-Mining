 OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of LÃ¼fukang Capsules on arrhythmia induced by ligation of coronary artery in dogs. METHODS: Thirty dogs were randomly divided into 5 groups, the model group administrated with equal volume of distilled water, the positive control group administrated with Wenxin Granules, and the small, medium and large dosage LFKC groups, 6 dogs in each group. Thirty minutes after medication, electrocardiogram was conducted and the time of arrhythmia occurrence, times of ventricular premature beat (VP), and incidence rates of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) were recorded in the model dogs with arrhythmia induced by ligation of coronary artery. RESULTS: Compared with the model group, the occurrence time of arrhythmia induced by the coronary artery ligation in the medium and large LFKC groups was significantly delayed (20.45 +/- 9.10 and 19.92 +/- 3.78, respectively, both P < 0.05). The frequency of VP in the medium and large LFKC groups was also significantly decreased (8.17 +/- 6.62 and 3.83 +/- 2.79, respectively, both P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: LFKC has anti-arrhythmic effects for the experimental arrhythmia induced by the ligation of coronary artery in dogs.
