 BACKGROUND: Approximately 0.05% of Emergency Department visits in the United States are related to supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The majority of patients convert with an atrioventricular nodal blocking medication. CASE REPORT: We report a case of SVT that converted after administration of calcium gluconate after failing conversion with adenosine. CONCLUSION: Conversion to normal sinus rhythm resulted after administration of i.v. calcium in our patient. Additional investigations would be helpful in determining the causal vs. temporal association of conversion of SVT with calcium administration.
