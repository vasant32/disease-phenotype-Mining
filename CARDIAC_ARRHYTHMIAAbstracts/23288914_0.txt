AIMS: The calcium sensitizer levosimendan may counteract stunning after reperfusion of ischaemic myocardium, but no randomized placebo-controlled trials exist regarding its use in PCI-treated ST-segment elevation infarction (STEMI). We evaluated the efficacy and safety of levosimendan in patients with a primary PCI-treated STEMI complicated by symptomatic heart failure (HF). METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 61 patients developing clinical signs of HF within 48 h after a primary PCI-treated STEMI (including cardiogenic shock) were randomized double-blind to a 25 h infusion of levosimendan or placebo. The primary endpoint was change in wall motion score index (WMSI) from baseline to day 5 measured by echocardiography. There was a significantly larger improvement in WMSI from baseline to day 5 in the levosimendan group compared with placebo (from 1.94 ± 0.20 to 1.66 ± 0.31 vs. 1.99 ± 0.22 to 1.83 ± 0.26, respectively, P = 0.031). There were significantly more episodes of hypotension during study drug infusion in the levosimendan group (67% vs. 36%, P = 0.029), but no significant difference in blood pressure at the end of infusion or in use of vasopressors. No significant between-group differences in changes in NT-proBNP levels, clinical composite score, frequency of atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmia, infarct size at 6 weeks, or new clinical events up to 6 months were found. One and four patients died in the levosimendan and placebo group, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Levosimendan treatment improved contractility in post-ischaemic myocardium in patients with PCI-treated STEMI complicated by HF. The treatment was well tolerated, without any increase in arrhythmias.Trial registration: NCT00324766.
