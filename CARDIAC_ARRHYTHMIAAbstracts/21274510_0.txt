Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, affects approximately 1% of adults and prevalence increases with age. Nine per cent of those aged 80 years and older have AF. AF is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, including stroke.Stroke in patients with AF is more severe and more likely to be fatal. Prevention of thromboembolism with oral anticoagulants and rate or rhythm control are the main therapeutic strategies for patients with AF. Vitamin K antagonists reduce the risk of stroke in patients with AF, however are underutilized. Dronedarone is the first antiarrhythmic drug that reduces the stroke rate.
