A case of carotid artery dissection in a 41-year-old-woman is described whose main symptom was cluster-like pain. The case is interesting for its atypical presentation with only two other like cases in the literature, and the site of dissection, localized in the intrapetrous curvature of the carotid artery. The case highlights the need for active co-operation between clinician and neuroradiologist during neuroimaging assessment which must be focused on the clinical evaluation of the individual patient so as to avoid error, particularly in atypical cases.
