Although intraarterial shunting during carotid endarterectomy is a well-defined practice, its use remains controversial. Complication rates associated with shunt placement remain low, but may be underreported. When complications secondary to routine intraarterial shunting occur, they can cause significant morbidity or even mortality, emphasizing the importance of meticulous technique to prevent adverse outcomes. We report a case of internal carotid artery dissection and pseuedoaneurysm due to the technical failure of a safety device of an intraarterial shunt used during carotid endarterectomy.
