The case presented offers a demonstration of a rare yet devastating condition that may go unrecognized and incompletely worked up by the emergency physician. Internal carotid artery dissection is seen most often in previously healthy, young patients and thus all efforts toward diagnosing this condition and providing proper stabilization must be made. Unfortunately, little advancement in the therapeutic progress of this frequently fatal condition has been made over the past decades. To date, both medical management and surgical techniques have been utilized with variable success. This case should serve to remind physicians evaluating young patients with stroke symptoms or other neurological findings that a negative head CT scan may not be the last test necessary for the definitive diagnosis.
