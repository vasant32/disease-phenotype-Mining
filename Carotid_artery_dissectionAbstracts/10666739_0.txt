The authors report the case of a 35-year-old male who underwent stenting for spontaneous cervical carotid dissection. He presented with sudden onset of hemicrania and left facial palsy followed by left hemiparesis and dysarthria. On admission, carotid angiography revealed postsinus tapering occlusion of the right internal carotid artery. Initially, he was managed with conservative treatment, but his neurological status deteriorated. Findings of brain CT, MRI and IMP-SPECT suggested hypoperfusion of the right cerebrum. A Palmaz stent, 39 mm in length, was successfully placed over the site of the dissection to restore normal patency through the dissected carotid artery. Following stent implantation, his neurological signs improved gradually but completely. Since the procedure, with oral administration of antiplatelet medication, he has suffered no cerebral ischemic events. Follow-up carotid angiography one year after stent implantation showed good patency of the stented segment. The present case emphasizes the usefulness of stenting for spontaneous cervical carotid dissection.
