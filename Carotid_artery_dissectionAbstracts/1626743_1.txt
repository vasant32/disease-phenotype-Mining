A spontaneous internal carotid artery dissection of an aneurysmal form is reported. The patient, a fifty-eight-year-old man, had manifested recurrent transient left hemiparesis, dysesthesia of the left upper limb, and dysarthria for three months. After administration of ticlopidine, the transient ischemic attacks completely disappeared. Three months later, the follow-up angiographic study revealed the same form of dissection in the same portion as compared with the initial study. Conservative therapy was successful.
