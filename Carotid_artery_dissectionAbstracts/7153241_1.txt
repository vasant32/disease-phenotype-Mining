Spontaneous dissection of the internal carotid artery is a rare condition. It is not usually associated with underlying arterial disease. A case of spontaneous dissection associated with fibromuscular dysplasia of the internal carotid artery is described. After complete resolution of the dissection the patient was left with a classic picture of fibromuscular dysplasia on cerebral angiography. This was treated with a graduated dilatation of the right internal carotid artery with resolution of symptoms.
