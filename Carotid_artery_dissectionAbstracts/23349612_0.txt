Emery-Dreifuss myopathy can be associated with a cardiomyopathy and cardiac dysrhythmias. The inheritance pattern of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is X linked, whereas EDMD2 is autosomal dominant. EDMD2 is caused by lamin A/C gene (LMNA) mutations that produce alterations in the lamin proteins that are integral to nuclear and cell integrity. A 53-year-old man was brought to us with a right internal carotid artery dissection. Detailed work-up of the patient and family members revealed some unusual features, and genetic sequencing of the LMNA gene was undertaken. A novel mutation was identified in two of the samples sent for analysis. We present the first Indian family of EDMD2 with familial dilated cardiomyopathy and cardiac dysrhythmias in whom LMNA gene sequencing was performed. A novel mutation was identified and additional unusual clinical features were described.
