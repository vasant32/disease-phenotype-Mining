OBJECTIVES: To review and evaluate our experience with carotid artery stenting in the acute treatment of carotid artery dissection (CAD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Reviewing the charts of our hospital between 2000 and 2001, we found two consecutive patients who benefited from primary stenting for the acute treatment of spontaneous extracranial internal CAD. RESULTS: Primary stenting of the internal carotid artery was successful in both cases without any post-operative complications. Clinical and US duplex scan follow-up confirmed the absence of neurological symptoms and the patency of the internal carotid artery with complete disappearance of the dissection at 36 and 42 months after the procedure, respectively. CONCLUSION: Despite the small number of patients, primary stenting for acute CAD seems to be safe and effective.
