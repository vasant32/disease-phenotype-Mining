Summary: Neuroform stents have been recently introduced for treatment of broad-necked intracranial aneurysms. Several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of deployment of Neuroform stents (Boston Scientific Target, USA) in intracranial circulation. We report a case of a patient presenting with acute stroke due to occlusive petrous segment internal carotid artery dissection who was treated with a Neuroform stent.
