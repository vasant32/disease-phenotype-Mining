In this retrospective study, we reviewed the records of 62 patients who were treated at a tertiary care community teaching hospital between 1977 and 1987 for major arterial injury caused by blunt trauma. Nearly half (45%, 28/62) of the injuries were to the thoracic aorta, 24% (15/62) were to arteries of the head and neck, 21% (13/62) were to the arteries of the extremities, and 10% (6/62) were to abdominal arteries. Twenty-eight thoracic aortic transections were repaired, 25 with Dacron grafts and three by primary repair. One patient developed an adventitial hematoma in the thoracic aorta, which was evacuated. Two patients required nephrectomies secondary to renal artery injury. Ten patients with internal carotid artery dissection were successfully treated with anticoagulation therapy. Eight (13%) of the 62 patients died: four from exsanguination, one from cardiac tamponade, one from renal failure, one from pulmonary emboli, and one from cerebral infarction secondary to intracerebral edema. Such injuries are amenable to treatment, with patient and end-organ viability, if recognized and treated promptly by the trauma surgeon.
