Injury to the carotid or vertebral artery is an important clinical entity that requires angiography for definitive diagnosis and evaluation. The common carotid artery may be injured by penetrating trauma while the internal carotid artery is usually damaged by either trivial or blunt trauma. With trivial trauma extracranial internal carotid artery dissection should be considered if there is unilateral headache, Horner's syndrome or delayed transient ischaemic attack, and intracranial dissection if a profound neurological defect occurs immediately following trauma. Injury to the internal carotid artery following blunt trauma includes dissection of the extracranial internal carotid artery, carotid-cavernous fistula and pseudoaneurysm formation. These should be considered in a patient with delayed neurological deficit, mandibular or skull fracture, a constellation of orbital signs or diffuse subarachnoid haemorrhage, respectively. Vertebral artery injury is less frequent. Dissection typically follows abrupt cervical rotation and occurs at C1-2, whereas penetrating trauma may involve either the proximal or distal vertebral artery and occlusion, arteriovenous fistula or pseudoaneurysm may be found. Endovascular techniques may be used in either the carotid or vertebral artery to close fistulae or occlude an extensively damaged vessel.
