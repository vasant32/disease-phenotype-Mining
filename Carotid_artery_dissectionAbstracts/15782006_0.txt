A 22-year-old man presented with sudden onset of right retro-orbital headache followed by left hemiparesis. Right carotid angiography demonstrated almost total occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) and severe stenosis of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), presumably caused by arterial dissection. Local arterial injection of urokinase was performed 2 hours after onset. The ICA became patent, but the M2 portion of the MCA was still occluded, and the left hemiparesis did not improve. Superficial temporal artery-MCA anastomosis was immediately performed. The left hemiparesis disappeared completely 6 days after this procedure. Angiography 2 weeks after the onset revealed occlusion of the ICA, and maintenance of blood flow to the right cerebral hemisphere via the anastomosis. Magnetic resonance imaging showed small infarcts in the right cerebral cortex. Repeat angiography after 5 months showed recanalization of the right ICA and the right MCA. Combination of thrombolytic therapy and bypass surgery may be a useful treatment option for patients with sudden occlusion of the intracranial artery caused by dissection.
