The evaluation of patients with loss of vision is common in the emergency department. Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is a potentially reversible cause of acute monocular blindness. When evaluating a patient with CRAO, the potential underlying causes should be considered while simultaneously initiating treatment. We present a case of spontaneous common carotid artery dissection manifesting as CRAO and propose that spontaneous carotid artery dissection be included in the differential diagnosis of CRAO.
