A 42-year-old man presented with right temporal headache, dysarthria, and dysphagia. On examination, he had a right hypoglossal nerve palsy. The diagnosis of right internal carotid artery dissection was suggested by magnetic resonance imaging and confirmed by carotid angiography. A dynamic computed tomogram demonstrated enlargement of the carotid artery. In carotid dissection, the hypoglossal nerve may be compromised by local factors as it passes close to the carotid artery in the neck.
