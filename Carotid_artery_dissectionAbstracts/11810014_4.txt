Autoimmune diseases are rarely the cause of stroke even in the young age group in association with cervical artery dissection and collagen vascular diseases. Takayasu arteritis is a chronic, idiopathic, inflammatory disease that primarily affects large vessels, such as the aorta and its main branches. Takayasu arteritis rarely coexists with systemic lupus erythematosus, and only few cases have been reported in association with the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. We describe a young patient with right internal carotid artery dissection and subsequent stroke who presented with all three syndromes. Although this patient met the diagnostic criteria for each syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, Takayasu arteritis and the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, it remains unlikely that the three disorders are not related. We suggest a single disimmune disorder may have led to carotid artery dissection.
