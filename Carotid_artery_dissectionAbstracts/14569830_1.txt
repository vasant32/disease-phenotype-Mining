BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection (ICAD) may be extremely difficult to diagnose only on the basis of historical information and clinical signs, and even standard brain imaging (computed tomography [CT], T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) may not be sufficient to delineate the underlying pathology clearly, as shown in this case. METHODS: The clinical presentation and parenchymal lesion pattern on CT were suggestive of inflammatory demyelinating disease, and additional multiparametric MRI was performed. RESULTS: Diffusion-weighted MRI, magnetic resonance angiography, and perfusion-weighted MRI revealed acute ischemic lesions, bilateral ICA obstruction, and bilateral hypoperfusion in the middle cerebral artery territories. Bilateral ICAD was confirmed by Doppler and duplex ultrasound, and anticoagulation therapy was initiated. A follow-up examination showed recanalization of the obstructed ICAs and the normalization of cerebral perfusion. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the importance of demonstrating the pathology and the value of multiparametric MRI techniques for the diagnosis and monitoring of ICAD and its hemodynamic consequences.
