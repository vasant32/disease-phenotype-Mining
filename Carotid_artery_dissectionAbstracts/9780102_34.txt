PURPOSE: To report the ophthalmologic symptoms and signs associated with extracranial internal carotid artery dissection. METHODS: One hundred forty-six consecutive patients with extracranial internal carotid artery dissection were evaluted; 29 were studied retrospectively from 1972 to 1984 and 117 prospectively from 1985 to 1997. RESULTS: Sixty-two percent of patients (91/146) with extracranial internal carotid artery dissection had ophthalmologic symptoms or signs that were the presenting symptoms or signs of dissection in 52% (76/146). Forty-four percent (65/146) had painful Horner syndrome, which remained isolated in half the cases (32/65). Twenty-eight percent (41/146) had transient monocular visual loss, which was painful in 31 cases, associated with Horner syndrome in 13 cases, and described as "scintillations" or "flashing lights"-often related to postural changes or exposure to bright lights-suggesting acute choroidal hypoperfusion in 23 cases. Four patients had ischemic optic neuropathy; one had diplopia. Among the 76 patients with ophthalmologic symptoms or signs as the presenting features of carotid dissection, a nonreversible ocular or hemispheric stroke later occurred in 27, within a mean of 6.2 days (range, 1 hour to 31 days). Eighteen patients had a stroke within the first week after the onset of neuro-ophthalmic symptoms and signs, and 24 had a stroke within the first 2 weeks. CONCLUSION: Ophthalmologic symptoms or signs are frequently associated with and are often the presenting features in internal carotid artery dissection. Painful Horner syndrome or transient monocular visual loss should prompt investigations to diagnose carotid artery dissection and begin early treatment to prevent a devastating ocular or hemispheric stroke.
