This paper describes an internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection model in a rabbit. An animal model for ICA dissection has not been described. New Zealand White rabbits were anaesthetized and surgical microdissection performed to expose the right internal carotid artery. A small arteriotomy was performed and a subadventitial plane of dissection created using blunt dissection and injected heparinized saline. The adventitia was sutured and the animals were recovered after closure of the wound. The procedure was repeated on the left ICA after 7 days with removal of the left ICA for control samples and removal of the right ICA to obtain sample specimens. The brain was also removed. A total of 11 control specimens and 9 sample specimens were obtained. The mean length of these specimens (n = 20) was 5.5 mm (range 5-6 mm). The mean length of dissection of the control specimens (n = 11) was 2.2 mm (range 2-3 mm). The mean length of dissection on sample specimens (n = 9) was 2 mm (range 1-3 mm). There was no extension of the arterial dissection. There was no intraluminal thrombosis or cerebral infarction. This model was able to induce arterial wall dissection in a rabbit. There was no extension of the induced dissection over 7 days. No local arterial or cerebral ischemic complications developed from the dissection.
