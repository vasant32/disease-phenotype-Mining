We report the case of an 8-year-old boy who suffered an internal carotid artery dissection as a result of an enoral soft tissue trauma. After an initial interval with minor symptoms he developed a cerebral infarction in the vascular region of the left middle cerebral artery. The patient was treated with decompression hemicraniectomy while therapy was monitored with intracranial pressure (ICP) measurements.
