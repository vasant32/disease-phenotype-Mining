OBJECTIVES: To describe a case of an isolated hypoglossal nerve palsy in a patient with a spontaneous internal carotid artery dissection (ICAD). This condition is a well-recognized cause of cerebral ischemic stroke in patients younger than 45 years of age. Isolated cranial nerve neuropathy is a rare presentation. More common manifestations include incomplete hemiparesis, hemicrania, Horner syndrome, cervical bruit, pulsatile tinnitus, and multiple cranial nerve palsies. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search (Ovid, MEDLINE) for the presentation, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, and outcome of patients with internal carotid artery dissection was performed. RESULTS: A 43-year-old man presented with a 3-week history of mild dysarthria. There was no history of craniocervical trauma. The physical examination revealed an isolated left hypoglossal nerve paresis. Magnetic resonance imaging and angiography findings were consistent with a left skull base ICAD. The patient was successfully treated with anticoagulation therapy. The current rate of cranial nerve involvement is estimated at 10% of all ICADs. This is the second report of isolated hypoglossal nerve palsy without hemicrania in a case of atraumatic ICAD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with an ICAD infrequently present to the otolaryngologist because of its head and neck manifestations. It is crucial to recognize atypical findings and to perform an accurate and prompt diagnostic evaluation. The foundation of treatment is aggressive anticoagulation, with surgical or radiologic intervention reserved for cases demonstrating life-threatening progression.
