Spontaneous carotid artery dissection is one of the main causes of stroke in young adults. We report two cases occurring after non-traumatic hyperextension of the head. Most of these events result from minor head trauma. Some family history cases would suggest the possibility of an underlying artery wall disorder. The favorable natural history of carotid dissection emphasizes the need for a noninvasive approach for diagnosis. Delayed diagnosis may lead to poor prognosis. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance angiography are adequate for diagnosis.
