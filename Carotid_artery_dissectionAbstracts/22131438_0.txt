Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is rare and previously was associated with a high mortality rate. Spontaneous dissection of the internal carotid artery is a cause of ischemic stroke, especially in young patients. Medical therapy allows healing of the carotid dissection in most patients, although endovascular stent placement has been reported for the treatment of selected cases. A case is reported of a patient in their late 30s who presented with a symptomatic occlusive cervical carotid artery dissection and, 7 days later, developed an acute coronary syndrome due to an occlusive dissection of the intermediate artery. Both lesions were treated with stent placement.
