We present a case report of a thirty-six-year-old right-handed female. She suffered with a malignant space-occupying supratentorial ischemic stroke caused by a traumatic cervical internal carotid artery dissection. She had a car accident and, initially, presented with a normal examination. In two days, she became comatose (Glasgow Coma Scale score was 5) with complete left hemiplegia, right mydriasis and required respiratory assistance despite the medical treatment. It was decided to perform a large right frontotemporoparietal bone flap with large dural plasty. Eighteen months later, with intensive rehabilitation, the results of neuropsychological testing were normal, and the Barthel Index score was 90. The indications for decompressive surgery in malignant space-occupying supratentorial ischemic stroke remains controversial. The age, general condition, neurological examination (consciousness, pupils, deficit), extent of parenchymal hypodensity and attenuated corticomedullary contrast on the brain CT, degree of midline shift, presence of uncal hernation, disparition of the visibility of the mesencephalic cisterns and third ventricle, high level of the intracranial pressure, and perhaps the results of the perfusion-and diffusion-weighted MRI, are the elements to decide (or not decide) decompressive surgery.
