BACKGROUND: Central retinal artery occlusion with persistent amaurosis as the only focal symptom caused by dissection of the internal carotid artery has occasionally been reported. Central retinal artery occlusion due to a common carotid artery dissection has been diagnosed only very rarely. CASE REPORT: We describe a patient presenting with cervical pain, headache and unilateral amaurosis due to a thrombosis of the central retinal artery caused by a common carotid artery dissection, as demonstrated on MR imaging. No other neurological deficits could be detected. The patient underwent an anticoagulative treatment without improvement of his vision, but also without the appearance of further neurological symptoms. CONCLUSION: In monocular visual loss combined with cervical pain or headache, carotid artery dissection should be considered. Early treatment might be of crucial importance for the prevention of a devastating hemispheric stroke.
