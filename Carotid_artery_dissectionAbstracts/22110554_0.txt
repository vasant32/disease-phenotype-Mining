Spontaneous internal carotid artery dissection is not an uncommon cause of ischaemic stroke in younger patients, but multiple cervical arterial dissections at presentation are uncommon. Recurrence of dissection in a previously normal artery is common. In this case report we review the history, clinical findings and management of a 42-year-old woman who presented with stroke and Horner syndrome and was found to have spontaneous bilateral internal carotid artery dissection. She was not anticoagulated due to concerns relating to the size of her infarct. She was treated with a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel. We use dual antiplatelets for the management of cervical dissections as a part of the CADISS trial. The patient made good progress with the multidisciplinary team and was discharged on day 22 with support from the community stroke team.
