Internal carotid dissection most commonly presents as headache, focal neurological deficits or stroke. Rarely it can manifest itself by causing a palsy of the lower cranial nerves (IX, X, XI, XII). The reported incidence of isolated cranial nerve palsies is rare. We report a case of an internal carotid artery dissection manifesting as isolated XII (hypoglossal) cranial nerve palsy.
