OBJECT: The incidence of carotid artery dissection related to blunt injury is very low, but the mortality rate is high. Rapid diagnosis and proper treatments are discussed. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 48-year-old woman presented diplopia and pulsating tinnitus of the left ear. An angiography showed a carotid cavernous fistula (CCF) and dissection of the extra-cranial internal carotid artery (ICA). To treat the dissection, a self-expanding endovascular stent was used. She has been followed for 6 years without any event and the ICA is patent. CONCLUSION: Prompt diagnosis without delay and intimate follow-up is the key for the treatment of a carotid injury. Those patients who exhibit cervical bruits and/or seat-belt signs should be examined aggressively. Angioplasty with stents is amenable for patients with traumatic carotid dissections requiring vascular reconstruction in the acute stage.
