CASE REPORT: We report on a 37-year old patient with sudden onset of pain of the right scalp and an ipsilateral small pupil, presenting five weeks after chiropractic manipulation of the neck. METHODS/RESULTS: Pharmacologic pupil testing showed a postganglionic Horner's syndrome on the right side. Magnetic resonance angiography confirmed the diagnosis of a dissection of the right internal carotid artery at a subacute stage. CONCLUSION: There appears to be a causal relationship between carotid artery dissection and the chiropractic manipulation of the cervical spine. Ophthalmological signs played the key role in detecting this complication.
