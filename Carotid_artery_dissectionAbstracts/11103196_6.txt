This case describes a 39-yr-old male, presenting with left hemiplegia after a road traffic accident involving frontal deceleration and airbag deployment. Brain computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed a right parietal lobe infarct. Contrast angiography demonstrated bilateral internal carotid artery dissection and fibromuscular dysplasia. The patient was treated with systemic heparinization. Neurological improvement, evidenced by full return of touch sensation, proprioception and nociception began 10 days after the injury. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of carotid artery dissection associated with airbag deployment. Forced neck extension in such settings may result in carotid artery dissection because of shear force injury at the junction of the extracranial and intrapetrous segments of the vessel. Clinicians should consider carotid artery injury when deterioration in neurological status occurs after airbag deployment. We propose that the risk of carotid artery dissection was increased by the presence of fibromuscular dysplasia.
