Dissections of the carotid and vertebral arteries are the common cause of stroke in young and middle-aged people. The incidence and prevalence are difficult to define, because dissection may be asymptomatic and patients with mild symptoms may not undergo extensive investigation. Cervicocephalic artery dissections have a wide spectrum of precipitating factors, symptoms and signs. Authors report an unusual case of carotid artery dissection with favourable outcome.
