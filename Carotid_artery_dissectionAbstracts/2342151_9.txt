A postmortem report of a patient with traumatic internal carotid artery dissection, along with evidence strongly suggestive of a car seatbelt as a causative factor, is presented. In this 5-foot subject, the shoulder harness could have been high, over the anterior cervical area. The authors feel this mechanism deserves consideration as one of the important causes of traumatic carotid dissection. If supported by further studies, remedial measures in the form of changes in seatbelt design, or the use of alternate protective measures may be warranted.
