Summary: This case illustrates the usefulness of an endovascular stent to treat a pseudoaneurysm of the cervical internal carotid artery. A 46-year-old male patient presented with a spontaneous dissection of the cervical internal carotid artery. After failing conservative therapy, he was treated by endovascular placement of a Palmaz stent at level of the pseudoaneurysm and dissection. Immediate obliteration of pseudoaneurysm was achieved, and patency of the internal carotid artery was maintained. The patient sustained no neurological complications and the stenosis of treated carotid artery did not occur during the 6-month follow-up period. For internal carotid artery dissection, stent placement seems to be a reasonable therapeutic alternative to direct surgery.
