BACKGROUND: In the chronic stage of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), recanalization can result in disparate MR appearances. We aimed to prospectively investigate the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance venography (MRV) in the evaluation of the recanalization of CVST. METHODS: This study prospectively evaluated the diagnostic performance of 2-dimensional time-of-flight (2D-TOF) MRV in thirty-two consecutive patients during a three- to six-month follow-up for CVST. Both 2D-TOF MRV and digital substraction angiography (DSA) were undertaken. Diagnostic accuracy of 2D-TOF MRV in the detection of recanalized thrombus was evaluated using DSA as the reference standard. RESULTS: MRV and DSA were completed without complications in all 32 patients. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 2D-TOF MRV for the detection of recanalization on a segmental basis were 91% (62/68), 93% (37/40), 95% (62/65), and 86% (37/43) respectively. CONCLUSION: 2D-TOF MRV provides high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of recanalized CVST segments.
