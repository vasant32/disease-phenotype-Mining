A 32 year old obese, diabetic and hypertensive woman presented with signs of increasing intracranial pressure: diplopia, partial lateralised Jacksonian seizures followed by alternating post-ictal hemiplegia. She was also anaemic. Investigation revealed lead poisoning and thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus. She recovered rapidly with heparin and calcium EDTA therapy, except for persistent optic atrophy due to the papilloedema. The authors discuss the relation of lead encephalopathy and dural sinus thrombosis, and the contribution of each condition to this patient's clinical symptoms.
