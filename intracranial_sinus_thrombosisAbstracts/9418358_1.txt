In this era of antimicrobial medication, intracranial complications following otitis media are rare. We present a 5-year-old boy who suffered from petrositis (Gradenigo syndrome) and cavernous sinus thrombosis as combined complications of acute otitis media caused by fusobacteria. The diagnosis was made using imaging methods suited to the various structures of the skull. Cure was achieved by prolonged conservative treatment with antibiotics, with gallium scan for evaluation of the bone inflammation.
