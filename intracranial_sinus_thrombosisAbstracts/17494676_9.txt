BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The diagnosis of cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis (CVST) as a rare but important cause of stroke is challenging. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of multidetector-row CT angiography (MDCTA) as a fast and cost-effective imaging tool in diagnosing CVST. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients who presented with clinical symptoms of a possible CVST were included. All patients had received both MDCTA and MR imaging with venous MR-angiography. Three blinded readers were asked to identify the cerebral sinuses and veins in MDCTA and to evaluate the presence of CVST in MDCTA. Consensus reading with interpretation of the MR imaging served to establish the definite diagnosis. RESULTS: The consensus reading revealed CVST in 10 of the 19 patients. With MDCTA, the venous sinuses could be identified in 99.2% and the cerebral veins in 87.6% of cases. The sensitivity and specificity of MDCTA for the diagnosis of CVST were 100%. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that MDCTA provides excellent sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CVST. Further studies are needed to evaluate the diagnostic potential of MDCTA in specific subsets of the general entity of CVST such as cortical venous thrombosis, thrombosis of the cavernous sinus, and thrombosis of the internal cerebral veins.
