Pseudotumor cerebri is a syndrome associated with diverse putative etiological factors that include chemicals such as vitamin A, tetracycline and estrogens or venous circulatory disturbances like sagittal or transverse sinus thrombosis. Diseases predisposing to thrombosis, such as polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, were reported to cause sinus thrombosis and pseudotumor cerebri. This is a pilot study to investigate the possible role of hemostatic factors in the pathogenesis of pseudotumor cerebri. We studied nine patients with severe, recurrent, or refractory pseudotumor cerebri causing visual impairment and found abnormal euglobulin clot lysis time (prestress in all of them and post stress in seven). Digital subtraction angiography was suggestive of recanalized sinus thrombosis in only three patients. We conclude that abnormalities in the fibrinolytic system are present in a subset of patients with severe pseudotumor cerebri, which calls for further studies on venous circulatory pathogenesis of pseudotumor cerebri and the possible role of anticoagulants in such cases.
