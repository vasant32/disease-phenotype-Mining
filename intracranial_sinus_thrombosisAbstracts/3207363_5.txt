Neonatal transverse sinus thrombosis (TST) is considered a rare and severe sequela of birth injury. Clinical descriptions of this entity are few since most published series are postmortem studies. The advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows recognition of TST ante mortem. We describe 4 full-term infants with distinct clinical and neuroradiological features indicative of TST, which we suggest may be relatively common, with a wide spectrum of severity, including favorable outcome.
