Two middle-aged women with haemorrhagic infarction due to thrombosis of the superior sagittal and transverse sinus, respectively, are herein reported. Severe iron deficiency anaemia secondary to myoma uteri seen in these patients was suggested to play a significant role in the development of the sinus thrombosis. In middle-aged women, myoma uteri deserves special attention as a possible aetiological contributor to cerebral sinus thrombosis.
