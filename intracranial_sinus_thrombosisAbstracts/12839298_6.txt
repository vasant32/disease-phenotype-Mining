Lemierre syndrome is a severe postanginal sepsis complicated by internal jugular thrombophlebitis. We report on a 14 y-old girl affected by high fever, shivering chills, headache, severe lateral neck pain, left ocular proptosis and general malaise. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck showed right internal jugular vein and sigmoid sinus thrombosis. Fusobacterium sp. was identified in the blood culture. CONCLUSION: Our report is a reminder that Lemierre syndrome still exists and remains potentially life threatening. A high index of suspicion is necessary to prompt diagnosis and treatment.
