Cerebral sinus thrombosis is a rare but severe complication during treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). It mostly has been reported during treatment with asparaginase and dexamethasone. Hypertriglyceridemia has - albeit very rarely - also been associated with asparaginase therapy. The combination of cerebral sinus thrombosis and hypertriglyceridemia however, has not yet been reported. Here we describe a 15-year-old boy who presented with clinical symptoms and radiologic findings of a cerebral sinus thrombosis. In addition, a life-threatening hypertriglyceridemia was present. The complication was successfully treated by anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin and the lipid regulator bezafibrate.
