Hypernatremia is a common electrolyte abnormality, but it is rarely attributable to excess sodium. Hypernatremia due to exogenous salt intake, caused either by accidental ingestion or as a form of child abuse, is rare, difficult to manage and results in high mortality. Although hypernatremia is easily recognized by laboratory tests, its etiology is often difficult to determine. A surprisingly small amount of salt intake can result in a fatal outcome. We report two cases of severe salt intoxication in two girls, aged 20 and 7 months, who presented with severe hypernatremia. Both had seizures after accidental salt ingestion. In the first case, salt instead of sugar was inadvertently added to two yoghurts, leading to hypernatremia and convulsions. In the second case, a mistake in the preparation of salt-saturated water as an oral rehydration solution provoked seizures, coagulopathy and longitudinal venous sinus thrombosis. Both cases developed encephalic death. We discuss the clinical course and the difficulties in the treatment of these cases in the context of the available literature.
