OBJECTIVE: Cochlear implantation has become a routine operation in the last 10 years. The most common soft tissue complications with transcutaneous cochlear implants include infection or necrosis of the flap and extrusion of the implant and device failure. The most common complication reported with percutaneous devices include minor skin irritations at the pedestal site, retraction of skin from the pedestal site, and loosening of screws that retain the pedestal. We describe one case of lateral sinus thrombosis and secondary temporal lobe infarction caused by infection of a screw anchoring the percutaneous pedestal of an Ineraid implant. STUDY DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial complications of a percutaneous bone-anchored pedestal may occur with little prodrome. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the pedestal and bone anchoring screws may be indicated if local evidence of infection persists.
