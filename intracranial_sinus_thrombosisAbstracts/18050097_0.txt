INTRODUCTION: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVSTs) constitutes an infrequent location of the venous thrombotic disease. It is caused by diverse factors, although up to 35% of the CVSTs can remain without aetiologic diagnosis. Coagulation disorders have been involved in up to 75% of the CVSTs. AIM. To describe the prevalence of coagulation disorders in a consecutive series of CVSTs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective revision of the clinical history of all patients with CVST admitted in our service between January, 1st 1995 and December, 31st 2005. The thrombophilic study was carried out a posteriori in whatever individual who lacked it. RESULTS: We studied twenty-one cases (7 men and 14 women), within an age range of 16-69 years old (corresponding to an average of 35,4 +/- 14,4 years old). The thrombophilic study was carried out in eighteen patients. Five (27,7%) presented some hereditary coagulation disorder; in four of them, a hormonal cause coexisted. CONCLUSION: Recent advances in the diagnostic procedures for the detection of thrombophilias and hereditary prothrombotic mutations have enabled the specialists to be more precise in the aetiologic diagnosis of suspected CVST. Even so, the apparent cause for a high percentage of patients with CVST has not been found yet.
