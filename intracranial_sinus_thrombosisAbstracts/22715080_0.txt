We present the case of a female patient with the combination of progressive cerebral sinus and venous thrombosis and unruptured intracranial aneurysm. Therapy of the symptomatic sinus thrombosis was initiated with heparin and endovascular occlusion of the aneurysm was planned within the next days. Before the coiling was performed fatal subarachnoid haemorrhage from the aneurysm occurred. The two dangerous neurologic diseases are presented and discussed with focus on symptomatology and therapeutic urgence.
