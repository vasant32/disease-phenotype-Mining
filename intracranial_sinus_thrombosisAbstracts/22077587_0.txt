A 74-year old gentleman with a cranio-cervical abscess failed to improve after incision and drainage and standard intravenous antibiotic therapy. Imaging demonstrated thrombosis of the internal jugular vein, sigmoid sinus and transverse sinus; and microbiological analysis isolated Fusobacterium nucleatum. The diagnosis of Lemierre's syndrome was confirmed, and he was effectively treated with appropriate antibiotics and anti-coagulation.
