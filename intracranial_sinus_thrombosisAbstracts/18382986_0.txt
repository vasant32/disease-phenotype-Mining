Congenital protein S deficiency is associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. A14-year-old boy presented with epileptic seizures and thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus and frontal hemorrhagic venous infarction after ingestion of 50 mg of dimenhydrinate, an antiemetic drug. The patient was found to be heterozygous for the factor V Leiden mutation and had a functional protein S deficiency. He recovered completely within a month after conservative treatment. Dimenhydrinate may have disrupted a subclinical pre-existing condition in this case.
