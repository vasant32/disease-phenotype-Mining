 BACKGROUND: Subclinical infection of the sinuses can result in delayed diagnosis and unusual presenting complications. CASE REPORT: This paper describes the case of a 14-year-old boy with a rare combination of periorbital cellulitis, subgaleal abscess and superior sagittal sinus thrombosis following a late presentation of unilateral frontal sinusitis. RESULTS: Following multiple surgical procedures, and antimicrobial and anticoagulation therapy, the patient made a full recovery. CONCLUSION: Serious sinusitis complications still occur, and can do so in unusual combinations with minimal clinical signs. Systemic anticoagulation therapy is considered safe practice in the management of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and may reduce morbidity and mortality.
