PURPOSE: To report the rate of occurrence of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in patients with presumed idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. PARTICIPANTS: All patients diagnosed with papilledema from November 1, 2002, through October 31, 2003, at 3 tertiary care neuro-ophthalmology centers. METHODS: Consecutive patients with a diagnosis of papilledema from 3 tertiary care neuro-ophthalmology centers were identified. Patients with space-occupying lesions, hydrocephalus, or meningitis were excluded. The remaining patients were evaluated with lumbar puncture, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetic resonance venography (MRV). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The rate of occurrence of CVST in patients with presumed IIH. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-one patients with papilledema were identified. Excluding patients with mass lesions, meningitis, or hydrocephalus, the occurrence of CVST was 10 (9.4%) of 106 patients with presumed IIH. Two additional patients had a diagnosis of suspected CVST. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis was diagnosed in 1 of the 10 patients with MRI alone, whereas it was evident in all 10 patients with MRV. Underlying risk factors for CVST were identified in 9 of 10 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis accounts for 9.4% of patients with presumed IIH in 3 tertiary care neuro-ophthalmology services. Magnetic resonance venography in combination with MRI is recommended to identify this subgroup of patients.
