This case report concerns a 59-year-old man with acute myocardial infarction associated with a giant organized thrombus occupying the right sinus of Valsalva that developed into chest pain and bradycardia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed low intensity in both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images, indicating that the mass was a thrombus. A direct approach involving grafting effectively resolved the embolization and myocardial ischemia, even during the subacute period.
