Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a serious condition affecting mostly women. This report concerns two cases of women who developed CVT within 14 days of cesarean delivery. Magnetic resonance angiography of the brain (venous phase) is the best modality to diagnose the condition, and parenteral application of low-molecular-weight heparin is the most beneficial treatment. The first patient was found to have an elevated factor VIII level. In the second patient, homozygosity of the C677T mutation in the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene was found. The puerperal period and Cesarean Section (CS) are risk factors for thrombotic complications, including CVT. It is necessary to search for risk factors in a patient's history and within the group of at-risk patients to prolong preventive administration of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). CVT (including puerperium related) is not a detrimental to future pregnancies.
