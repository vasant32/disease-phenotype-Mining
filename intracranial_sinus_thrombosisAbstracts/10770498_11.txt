OBJECTIVE: To inform clinicians about the use of magnetic resonance (MR) venography in idiopathic pseudotumor cerebri. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study to evaluate for the presence or absence of dural sinus thrombosis using MR imaging and MR venography of the brain in 22 consecutive young, female, overweight patients with typical pseudotumor cerebri. RESULTS: None of the 22 MR imaging and MR venography studies showed venous sinus thrombosis. CONCLUSION: Magnetic resonance venography might not add significantly to the evaluation of typical idiopathic pseudotumor cerebri but may be indicated in atypical cases (e.g., male, thin, or elderly patients).
