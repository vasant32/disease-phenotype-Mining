We report a case of extradural abscess after acute mastoiditis in an 8-years-old boy. The clinic diagnostic of an intracranial complication is difficult. The most common present symptoms are fever, otalgia and otorrhea but are not specific. Neurologic symptoms are suggestive signs of an intracranial complication. We believe that, in acute mastoiditis performance of a CT scan of the brain and temporal bones with intravenous contrast, contribues to the diagnostic of intracranial complication. The diagnostic of thrombosis sinus sigmoid is evoked with slight contrast enhanced sinus sigmoid and failure to opacify. The characterisation of an epidural empyema is a hypodense epidural collection in a contrast-enhanced CT scan. The most common isolated organism are Streptococcus Pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeuginosa. The therapeutic management includes combination of intraveinous antibiotics, mastoidectomy and surgery of the intracranial complication.
