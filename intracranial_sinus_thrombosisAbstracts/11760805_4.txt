Various hypotheses have been reported concerning the pathogenesis of dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs). However, it is still controversial whether sinus thrombosis or venous hypertension has a greater influence on the formation of DAVFs. We present a rare case of multiple DAVFs that developed after sinus thrombosis. Chronic venous hypertension secondary to sinus thrombosis in the left transverse-sigmoid sinus induced the multiple DAVFs, including one in the right cavernous sinus, which was remote from the occluded sinus. This case indicates the importance of venous hypertension in the formation of DAVFs.
