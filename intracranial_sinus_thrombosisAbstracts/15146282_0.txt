In the past 10 years numerous reports of cases referring to complications and their outcome with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II (HIT II) have been published. Clinically these symptoms are manifested as a combination of arterial and venous thromboembolisms. Mostly affected are the vessels of the limbs, the abdomen, kidneys and coronary arteries. We present the most rare initial manifestations of cerebral symptoms with headache, nausea, change of character and generalised convulsion, which have found their origin in sinus vein thrombosis and the treatment with the heparinoid danaparoid.
