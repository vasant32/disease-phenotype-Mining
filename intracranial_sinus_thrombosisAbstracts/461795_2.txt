Four patients who sustained crushing fractures of the sphenoidal bone had angiographic evidence of venous occlusions of the cavernous area. Signs depended upon the type of basal venous and cavernous anatomy. The diagnosis can be made by demonstrating abrupt cutoff of veins in the cavernous region, preferred retrograde flow of the anterior cavernous sinus, direct venous hemorrhage, and venous stasis.
