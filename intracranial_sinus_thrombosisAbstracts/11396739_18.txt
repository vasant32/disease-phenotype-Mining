Our purpose of this study was to demonstrate the clinical potential and spatial resolution of a new MRI technique: high-resolution blood oxygen-level dependent venography (HRBV), in well-known intracranial vascular lesions, such as cavernous and venous angiomas, and venous sinus thrombosis. HRBV provides unique high-resolution information on veins without administration of contrast medium. The data are independent of conventional findings on MRI and potentially useful in characterising and demonstrating the architecture of vascular lesions of the brain.
