The case of a 7-year-old child with acute lymphocytic leukemia who, while in relapse, developed a superior sagittal sinus thrombosis is documented by angiography and post-mortem examination. Review of the literature suggests that cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis which usually accompanies the arachnoid infiltration of central nervous system (CNS) leukemia may be absent in some patients as in this case. In the absence of CSF pleocytosis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis may mimic the other signs and symptoms of CNS leukemia and consequently may be a more frequent complication of acute leukemia than is presently appreciated. Therapy directed to the CSF axis generally would not under these circumstances be appropriate.
