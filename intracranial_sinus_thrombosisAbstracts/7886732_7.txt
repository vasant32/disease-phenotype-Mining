BACKGROUND: Superior sagittal sinus thrombosis is an uncommon cerebrovascular accident that is frequently associated with diseases that may contribute to the development of thrombosis through hypercoagulability, stasis of the local blood stream, and abnormalities of the vessel wall. In approximately 25% of cases underlying diseases remain unrecognized. CASE DESCRIPTIONS: Two patients with superior sagittal sinus thrombosis during a thyrotoxic phase of Graves' disease are described. Both patients presented with hemiplegia, seizures, and a large goiter. CONCLUSIONS: The development of superior sagittal sinus thrombosis is multifactorial. Patients with thyrotoxicosis and a large goiter may be predisposed to the development of superior sagittal sinus thrombosis through hypercoagulability and stasis of the local venous blood flow.
