Cerebrovascular disease in children is more common than was once recognized. It is typically associated with an underlying anatomic anomaly or systemic disease. The most common underlying anomaly found with thrombotic or embolic stroke is congenital or acquired heart disease, while the most common predisposing factors to intracranial hemorrhage in children, other than trauma, are the leukemias and arteriovenous malformations. Many of the disorders associated with childhood stroke are treatable. Children tend to show more recovery after a stroke than adults do.
