Neurological deterioration during an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis is usually assumed to be caused by cerebral oedema. We present a case of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis presenting in a similar manner, also associated with severe iron deficiency anaemia. Computed tomography scanning provided the correct diagnosis and allowed institution of anticoagulation with improvement in neurological outcome. Neuroimaging should always be performed in suspected cerebral oedema associated with diabetic ketoacidosis in order to exclude other pathologies.
