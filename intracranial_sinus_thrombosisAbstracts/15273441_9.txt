Time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance venography (MRV) is often used to examine the intracranial dural sinuses, particularly in the evaluation of dural sinus thrombosis. The goal of the study was to evaluate the use of TOF MRV in assessing the normal anatomy of dural sinuses and their variations as sources of potential pitfalls in the diagnosis of venous sinus thrombosis. Cerebral TOF MRV obtained in 105 persons with normal MR studies were reviewed to determine the presence, aplasia and hypoplasia of the transverse sinuses. Twenty-one (20%) aplasias of the left sinus, 41 (39%) hypoplasia of the left sinus, 33 (31%) symmetric, 6 (6%) hypoplasia of the right sinus, and 4 (4%) aplasias of the right sinus cases were determined in the asymmetry in sizes of transverse sinuses. These results suggested that transverse sinus flow gaps or aplasias can be observed in approximately 24% of normal population on MR imaging. The rate of these gaps in normal subjects must be kept in mind because it can be a source of misdiagnosis in cases of suspected dural sinus thrombosis.
