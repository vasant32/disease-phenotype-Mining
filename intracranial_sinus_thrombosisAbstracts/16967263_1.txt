INTRODUCTION: Diagnosis of cerebral sinus vein thrombosis is still a challenge for imaging. MRI and MRA play a major role in sinus imaging. For further development of MR techniques, MR-compatible animal models are required. The aim of this study was to develop an animal model for sinus thrombosis and additional cortical vein thrombosis with a clot of human blood for MR imaging studies. METHODS: A combined surgical and interventional approach was carried out in 13 pigs. After minimal invasive surgical access to the anterior superior sagittal sinus and cortical vein, thrombosis with human blood was induced using an interventional catheter approach. MR imaging was performed prior to and after thrombus induction. RESULTS: Sinus thrombosis was induced in 12 of 13 animals. Three animals suffered acute subdural haemorrhage; one of these animals died during the intervention, and one died after thrombus induction. MR imaging of the thrombosed sinus could easily be performed without significant artefacts in 11 of 13 animals. CONCLUSION: This new model of sinus and cortical vein thrombosis with a clot of human blood allows artefact-free imaging studies on MR.
