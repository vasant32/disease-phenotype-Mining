The cause of intraventricular hemorrhage in term neonates is poorly understood. Among 29 neonates of at least 36 weeks' gestation with intraventricular hemorrhage, 9 (31%) had cerebral sinovenous thrombosis. Of the 26 neonates who underwent computed tomography or magnetic resonance studies, those with thalamic hemorrhage were more likely to have sinovenous thrombosis than those without thalamic involvement (4/5 vs 5/21, p = 0.03). Term neonates with intraventricular hemorrhage should undergo neuroimaging to evaluate the presence of sinovenous thrombosis. Ann Neurol 2003
