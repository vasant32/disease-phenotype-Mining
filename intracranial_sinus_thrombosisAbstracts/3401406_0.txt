Magnetic resonance images of a case of superior sagittal sinus thrombosis before and after complete recanalization are presented. The patient was a 61-year-old man with two days history of intermittent right hemiconvulsion followed by post-ictal hemiplegia. Mild erythrocytosis was noted on admission. CT scans revealed left frontal hemorrhagic infarction with empty delta sign in the middle portion of the superior sagittal sinus. Left carotid angiogram showed occlusion of two frontal cortical veins and retrograde filling of these veins into the cavernous sinus. Lack of filling of the middle and anterior part of the superior sagittal sinus was noted. These studies led to the diagnosis of superior sagittal sinus thrombosis associated with hemorrhagic infarction. He was treated with intravenous infusion of low molecular dextran and venesection. Neither heparin, urokinase, hyperosmolar solutions nor steroids were used because of the presence of hemorrhagic infarction and of the lack of signs of increased intracranial pressure. He completely recovered neurologically and recanalization of the superior sagittal sinus was confirmed angiographically eight weeks after the onset. Magnetic resonance images were taken with a Siemens 1.5 T Magnetom scanner using spin-echo pulse sequences. A T 1-weighted mid-sagittal magnetic resonance image ten days after the onset showed hyperintensity in the middle part of the superior sagittal sinus which corresponded to the thrombus. Both T 1 and T 2 weighted coronal images revealed a small area of hypointensity indicating the existence of residual blood flow in the superior sagittal sinus in addition to the thrombus both in the sinus and in the cortical vein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
