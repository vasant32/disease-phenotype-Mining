INTRODUCTION: Thrombosis of the cerebral venous sinuses (TCVS) is an infrequent entity that still represents a challenge in health care. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A descriptive study involving the evaluation of the medical records of patients that met the following criteria: over 18 years of age with a diagnosis of TCVS confirmed by CAT scan or cranial MRI, the absence of a history of intracranial surgery in the previous six months and absence of a history of intracranial infection. RESULTS: A total of 15 patients (14 females and one male) were found with an average age of 28.6 years. The time required for the development of the most frequent symptoms was 1 10 days (60%). The usual presentation was a syndrome of intracranial hypertension with focalisation and encephalopathy. Risk factors were identified in 13 patients (87%). TCVS was diagnosed by cranial MRI in the case of 14 patients (93%), by CAT scanning in one (7%) and this was also used to orient diagnosis in 12 cases (80%). The most frequently affected sinuses were the superior longitudinal and transverse, in 10 cases each (66%), and venous infarctions were also detected in 10 patients (66%). In the patients in whom we were able to evaluate clotting disorders, it was found that the only individual who displayed activated protein C resistance was positive, three out of four patients had a protein C deficiency and four out of six had an antithrombin III deficiency. CONCLUSION: TCVS presents as an intracranial hypertension syndrome and it is possible to find risk factors in as many as 85% of the cases.
