The hazards associated with invasive candidiasis and aspergillosis in oncology patients are well recognised. These conditions typically present late in treatment, often after prolonged or recurrent episodes of neutropenia. We report the occurrence of Absidia corymbifera infection causing rhinocerebral zygomycosis in two children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, early in the induction phase of treatment and within a 3-month interval, in the same oncology unit. The initial presentation of facial pain was rapidly followed by the development of cranial nerve palsies, cavernous sinus thrombosis, diabetes insipidus, seizures and death within 9 days of symptom onset, despite aggressive management with high-dose liposomal amphotericin (Ambisome), surgical debridement and local instillation of amphotericin solution. These cases highlight the need for awareness of zygomycosis as a potentially lethal fungal infection that can present even with short duration exposure to the usual risk factors. Their occurrence within a limited time period raises questions as to the relative importance of environmental exposure. The failure of medical and surgical intervention to impact on the course illustrates the need to develop appropriate preventative strategies which may have to incorporate measures to reduce the environmental exposure of susceptible patients.
