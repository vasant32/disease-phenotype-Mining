Two children with intracranial venous sinus thrombosis complicating mastoiditis prompted review of the experience with these disorders at the The Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago over the past decade. Fifteen patients, 1.5 to 14 years of age, with mastoiditis were identified, including nine cases categorized as acute and six as chronic, the latter without fever but with chronic otorrhea. All six patients with chronic, but none with acute, mastoiditis were found to have cholesteatomas. Venous sinus thrombosis developed in four children and intracerebellar abscess in one child. Contrast-enhanced computerized tomography has proved valuable in the diagnosis of these rare, serious complications of mastoiditis in recent patients. Arteriography is still desired to confirm venous patency or occlusion prior to surgery because of well-documented developmental variations in venous drainage patterns. Optimal therapy of mastoiditis and its complications generally requires surgical drainage in addition to administration of antibiotics.
