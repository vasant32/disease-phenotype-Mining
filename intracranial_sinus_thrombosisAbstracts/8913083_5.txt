A 35-year-old male was admitted with headache, nausea, and vomiting persisting for 2 days. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a left chronic subdural hematoma. Cerebral angiography demonstrated cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). He had presented with a subcutaneous mass involving the neck at age 2 years, which was shown to be a cavernous angioma, and thereafter shown signs of consumptive coagulopathy with systemic multiple hemangiomas. Burr hole aspiration of the hematoma was performed. Seventy-two-hours later, he developed clouding of consciousness and right hemiparesis. CT revealed a fresh hematoma in the operated subdural cavity and hemorrhagic diathesis manifested. A frontotemporoparietal large craniotomy was performed to remove the hematoma. Extensive electrocauterization was required. He had a satisfactory postoperative course. Collateral venous pathways, resulting from the CVST due to systemic multiple hemangiomas, may have caused hemodynamic stress in the bridging veins which subsequently induced chronic subdural hematoma.
