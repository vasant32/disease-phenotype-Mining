We present a series of three patients with mastoid air cell effusions associated with adjacent lateral sinus thrombosis. In all of these cases, the findings support the hypothesis that the mastoid effusion is secondary to sinus thrombosis rather then the other way around. Also shown is the chronology and natural evolution of mastoid air cell effusion secondary to sinus thrombosis as seen on planar imaging.
