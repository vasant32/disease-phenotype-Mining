Venous sinus thrombosis is a rare entity that usually arises secondary to underlying thrombophilia, neoplasm, head injury, or infection. Tympanic infection accounts for the majority of infectious etiologies, and the sigmoid sinus becomes the likely anatomical site of thrombosis. The authors report a case involving a child with recurrent otitis media who presented with an atraumatic epidural hematoma secondary to sigmoid sinus thrombosis. Intraoperative evaluation revealed epidural hemorrhage that originated from the venous sinus, with hemorrhagic products of varying ages. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of a venous sinus thrombosis resulting in an epidural hematoma.
