A new simplified cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA) has been performed using a fine subcutaneous needle (21G-23G) and minimal volume (1.5 2 ml) contrast medium in 33 cases. Representative angiograms have been presented in 3 cases (one of occlusive cerebrovascular disease, cerebral aneurysm, and superior sagittal sinus thrombosis respectively). Advantages of this method are simple procedure, easy puncture with little carotid injury and almost none of patient's complaints accompanied by dye-injection. Therefore, this technique is very useful in emergency cases, as a screening test in an outpatient clinic, and also in senile cases. Periarterial injection of contrast media was experienced in 5 cases which would be overcome by using a little larger needle like 21G in the future.
