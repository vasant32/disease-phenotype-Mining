We report a case of dural arteriovenous malformation (AVM) of the transverse sinus with sinus occlusion. This 49-year-old man developed right parietal lobe dysfunction with acute onset. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a non-hemorrhagic venous infarct in the subcortical white matter of the right parietal lobe, and diffusely dilated subcortical veins. Thrombosis of the right internal jugular bulb was also revealed on MRI. Cerebral angiography showed a dural AVM in the posterior fossa with occlusion of the right transverse sinus and retrograde venous drainage into the superior sagittal sinus, causing diffuse engorgement of the superficial cortical and the deep intramedullary veins. The focal neurologic deficits in this case were due to a non-hemorrhagic venous infarct in the subcortical white matter of the right parietal lobe secondary to retrograde cortical venous drainage.
