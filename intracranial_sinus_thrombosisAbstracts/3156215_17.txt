Vascular recanalizing techniques only recently became methods of some clinical importance. Angioplasty of the subclavian artery in cases with subclavian steal syndrome has now been performed in so many instances that it can be judged safe. Angioplasty at the origin of the vertebral artery has not yet been performed in as many cases. However, even there this method is obviously less hazardous than surgery. Local intraarterial fibrinolytic therapy is the only therapy providing some success in progressive stroke from vertebrobasilar thrombosis. In contrast to the vertebrobasilar territory local fibrinolytic therapy within the carotid territory has to be strictly limited to some special indications.
