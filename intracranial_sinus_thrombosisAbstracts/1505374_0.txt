The incidence of lateral sinus vein thrombosis has been reduced by the use of antibiotics, but it is still a major complication of middle ear disease. Patients without active acute or chronic middle ear infection, however, develop this deadly complication. CT scan is helpful in diagnosis, but mostly the final diagnosis is made by surgical exploration. A case of a 23-year-old patient who developed lateral sinus vein thrombosis without an active middle ear disease is presented. The pertinent literature is discussed.
