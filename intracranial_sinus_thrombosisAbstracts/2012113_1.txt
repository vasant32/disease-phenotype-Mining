A 33-year-old woman developed headaches, papilledema, and evanescent neurologic signs. MRI demonstrated thrombosis of the sagittal, transverse, and sigmoid sinuses. After initial heparinization and three months of oral anticoagulation therapy, papilledema was still present but the neurologic signs and symptoms had markedly improved. Repeat MRI scan revealed improvement in all dural thromboses.
