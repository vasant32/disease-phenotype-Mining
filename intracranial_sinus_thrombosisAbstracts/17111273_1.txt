We report results applying the dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) magnetic resonance (MR) technique to a patient with dural venous sinus thrombosis (DVST) of the right transverse-sigmoid sinus without brain parenchymal abnormality. The DSC-MR technique clearly demonstrated increased regional cerebral blood volume of the right temporo-parieto-occipital region adjacent to a right transverse-sigmoid sinus thrombosis in a patient with DVST without cerebral edema or hemorrhage.
