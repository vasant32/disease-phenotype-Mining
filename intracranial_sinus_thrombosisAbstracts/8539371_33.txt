PURPOSE: To produce cerebral venograms with thin-section helical computed tomography (CT) and to assess their diagnostic utility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six CT venograms were obtained in 33 patients after intravenous administration of iodinated contrast material. Eighteen patients had suspected dural sinus thrombosis. Twelve patients had tumor adjacent to a major venous structure. Three patients underwent CT venography during CT angiography. RESULTS: Superior sagittal, transverse, and straight sinuses were identified on every CT venogram. Other veins were seen with high frequency. Dural sinus thrombosis was diagnosed in seven patients, with magnetic resonance (MR) venographic correlation in five patients. CT venograms were easier to interpret and had fewer artifacts than MR venograms. Relationships of tumor to adjacent cerebral venous structures were well shown on CT venograms. CONCLUSION: CT venography yields detailed images of the intracranial venous circulation with consistently high quality. It is a rapid, useful method for diagnosis of dural sinus thrombosis and for preoperative mapping of venous structures in patients with neoplasm.
