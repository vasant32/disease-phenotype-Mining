Thrombosis events may occur in celiac disease. Thrombophilic risk factors have been reported. INTRODUCTION: To report two cases of cerebral venous thrombosis in celiac disease patients and to determine associated thrombophilic factors. Case 1: a 63-year-old woman was admitted for cerebral venous thrombosis. Her past history included celiac disease which was untreated for the last 10 years. Biological data showed moderate hyperhomocysteinemia and positive reaction for antiphospholipid antibodies. Case 2: a 19-year-old girl was hospitalized for seizures and impaired consciousness. MRA demonstrated longitudinal sinus thrombosis with parietal infarction. Biological findings showed: protein S deficiency and positive reaction for antiendomysium and antigliadin antibodies. Gastroesophageal endoscopy with biopsy showed villous atrophy. Both patients improved under anticoagulant treatment. CONCLUSION: The sites of associated venous thrombosis are generally unusual in celiac disease, yet the cerebral localization is only exceptionally reported. It is essential to search for risk factors. Gluten-free diet remains the mainstay treatment for patients with celiac disease.
