 BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVT) is an uncommon cause of stroke that is usually treated medically with intravenous heparin therapy followed by long-term anticoagulation therapy. A series of patients with CVT who underwent rheolytic thrombectomy with the AngioJet as a first-line adjunctive treatment in addition to standard anticoagulation therapy is presented. METHODS: Prospectively maintained endovascular databases at two institutions were retrospectively reviewed. The available clinical and imaging data were compiled at each institution and combined for analysis. RESULTS: Over 18 months, 13 patients (seven women and six men; age range 17-73 years, median age 45 years) with CVT were treated with rheolytic thrombectomy. Immediate (partial or complete) recanalization of the thrombosed intracranial sinuses was achieved in all patients. At a median radiographic follow-up of 7 months there was continued patency of all recanalized sinuses. Clinical follow-up was available on nine patients: modified Rankin score of 0 in four patients, 1 in three patients and 6 in two patients. CONCLUSION: This series demonstrates the feasibility of performing mechanical thrombectomy as a first-line treatment for acute CVT. This technique facilitates the prompt restoration of intracranial venous outflow, which may result in rapid neurological and symptomatic improvement.
