Summary: Dural arteriovenous shunts (DAVS) occur within the walls of dural venous sinuses or their tributaries. They may be related to previous episodes of sinus thrombosis. The presence of impediments to venous outflow results in venous congestion, predisposing to haemorrhage and cerebral parenchymal damage. Cerebral venous congestion is an indication for treatment. This case is unusual in some respects; firstly, the patient was relatively well despite worrisome features on imaging and secondly the occluded dural venous sinuses appeared to spontaneously recanalize after treatment of the DAVS. Anticoagulation may have had a role in avoiding thrombosis of the patient's precarious venous drainage after embolisation and in encouraging recanalization of the thrombosed dural venous sinuses.
