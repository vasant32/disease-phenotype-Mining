 AIM: To evaluate the incidence, presenting symptoms, diagnostic delay, risk factors and short-term outcome of childhood stroke in a population-based cohort of Swedish children. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of children experiencing their first stroke during a 7-year period in Uppsala-Ã–rebro Health Care Region covering one-fifth of the Swedish population. Arterial ischaemic stroke (AIS), cerebral sinus venous stroke and nontraumatic haemorrhagic stroke (HS) in children aged > 28 days and < 18 years were included. RESULTS: We identified 51 children (23 boys and 28 girls; median age 13). The average annual incidence of stroke was 1.8 per 100,000 children. AIS was found in 51% of the children, HS in 41% and cerebral sinus venous stroke in 8%. One-third of the children had underlying diseases, and one-third had vascular malformations. Six girls used oral contraceptives, three of these were smokers and two had iron deficiency anaemia. Two children died in the acute stage (4%), and 40/49 (82%) had some neurological dysfunction at discharge. CONCLUSION: The incidence of childhood stroke was 1.8 per 100,000 children and year, and the primary mortality was 4%. Risk factors of importance were oral contraceptives, smoking and anaemia in combinations.
