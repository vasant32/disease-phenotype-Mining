This paper describes an uncommon case of a patient with anomaly of a persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC). A 54-year-old man with a history of chronic kidney disease, heart failure, diabetes mellitus and hypertension was admitted to the hospital for worsening dyspnoea. During his hospital stay, heart failure was further deteriorated and he became anuric. Renal replacement therapy was then required. After multiple unsuccessful attempts of right subclavian vein catheterisation, a catheter was placed in the left subclavian vein. Chest X-ray revealed the catheter in the left side of the thorax. Transthoracic cardiac ultrasound with agitated saline and chest MRI confirmed the diagnosis of PLSVC. The patient had nine sessions of slow continuous ultrafiltration. His heart and renal function were gradually improved. Nephrologists and health care professionals must be aware of this uncommon anatomic variant. Unnecessary manipulations can lead to serious complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest and venous sinus thrombosis.
