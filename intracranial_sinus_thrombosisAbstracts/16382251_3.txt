INTRODUCTION: Dural sinus thrombosis following minor head injury is rare. We report such a case in a child after mild head injury. CLINICAL PICTURE: A 4-year-old child presented with giddiness and vomiting after a fall. Clinical examination was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance venogram revealed thrombosis of the right sigmoid and transverse sinuses. TREATMENT: The patient was managed conservatively. OUTCOME: Repeat scans 10 weeks after injury showed recanalisation of the thrombosis. CONCLUSION: Dural sinus thrombosis should be excluded in children presenting with persistent giddiness and vomiting after minor head injury.
