We report two pediatric patients with unusual, aggressive initial manifestation of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus. The first patient, a 13-year-old girl, presented with bilateral amaurosis and ischemic cerebral lesions. The second, another 13-year-old girl, presented with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and membranous glomerulonephritis. Both patients improve after treatment with anticoagulants and immunosuppressive drugs, two therapies that are aimed at modulating the immune response or towards preventing thromboembolic events. However, there is no consensus regarding the duration and intensity of oral anticoagulation in children with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
