IN ARTERIAL ISCHEMIC PATHOLOGY: Magnetic resonance imaging is increasingly proposed for any suspicion of cerebral vascular accident. Because of its diffusion sequences, it permits the rapid diagnosis and screening of ischemic lesions and provides prognostic information. FOR OTHER CEREBRAL VASCULAR DISORDERS: Intra-parenchymatous and sub-arachnoid hemorrhages are easily revealed by MRI. Today, MRI is the most effective examination for the diagnosis of venous thrombosis and of its impact on the parenchyma.
