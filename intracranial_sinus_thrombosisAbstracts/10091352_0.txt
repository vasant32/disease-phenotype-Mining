At present, the frequency of intracranial complications of middle ear infections has decreased sharply as a result of the use of more effective antibiotics. We report two cases of lateral sinus thrombosis, in a 2-year-old male and a 14-year-old male respectively, after middle ear infection that progressed to mastoiditis with osteitis. The severity of these complications underlines the importance of clinical awareness and early diagnosis by angiographic magnetic resonance imaging so that suitable treatment can be begun.
