We report a case of cavernous sinus thrombosis in an 8-year-old boy, following a neglected and untreated nasal furuncle. This rare entity is manifested by hyperthermia, with headache, vomiting and involvement of the III-IV & VI cranial nerves. It is usually a complication of a facial infection. The diagnosis is established by CT-Scan or MRI. Without appropriate and early treatment, the prognosis is poor, with a fatal outcome or severe sequelae.
