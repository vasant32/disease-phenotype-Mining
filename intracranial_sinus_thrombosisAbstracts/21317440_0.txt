 OBJECTIVE: To describe different patterns of associated brain lesions in preterm and full-term infants with cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT) and to assess whether these different patterns are related to gestational age at onset. DESIGN: Magnetic resonance scans of all neonates (six preterm, 24 full term) with suspected CSVT, collected over a 7-year period in two neonatal intensive care units, were evaluated to assess patterns of associated brain lesions. Comparisons between the two gestational age groups were made. RESULTS: CSVT was confirmed on magnetic resonance venography in 26 of 30 neonates (six preterm, 20â‰¥36 weeks' gestational age). The straight (85%) and superior sagittal (65%) sinus were most often affected. Several sinuses were involved in 81% of infants. White matter damage affecting the entire periventricular white matter was seen in five of six preterm infants. Intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) was common in both groups (4/6 preterm, 16/20 full term). Frontal punctate white matter lesions with restricted diffusion (15/20) and thalamic haemorrhage associated with IVH (11/20) were the most frequent lesions in full-term infants. Focal arterial infarction was present in four of 20 full-term infants. Six infants died in the neonatal period (four preterm, two full term). Follow-up MRIs at 3 months in all survivors showed evolution of the lesions with frontal atrophy in 13 of 20 (12 full term) and delayed myelination in seven of 20 (six full term). CONCLUSIONS: Preterm and full-term neonates show different patterns of associated brain lesions. Extensive white matter damage is the predominant pattern of injury in the preterm infant, while an IVH associated with a thalamic haemorrhage and punctate white matter lesions are more common in the full-term infant.
