We evaluated effects of thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus, its bridging and cortical veins (SVT) on the cerebral microvasculature in rats. Cryosections of brains ( n=7) were examined for venous infarction and microvascular basal lamina damage 3 h after SVT by immunohistochemical staining of microtubule-associated protein 2 and collagen type IV. Microvessels in the infarctions showed a decrease in the number (23.5+/-6.1%, P<0.002) and the total area (24.9+/-6.5%, P<0.011) of collagen type IV-positive vessels in contrast to control areas (21.7+/-12.4%, P<0.007; and 26.3+/-15.1%, P<0.026 in contrast to control areas of unoperated animals). This study showed a significant alteration of the cerebral microvasculature in SVT, which might contribute to edema and hemorrhagic transformation.
