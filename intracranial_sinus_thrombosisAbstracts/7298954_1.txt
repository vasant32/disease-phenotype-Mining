The computed tomography (CT) findings in a case of angiographically verified cerebral sinovenous thrombosis with occlusion of the right sigmoid sinus and stenosis of the left sigmoid sinus are reported. The CT appearance included abnormally dense borders of the tentorial incisura and postcontrast tentorial enhancement. The existence of tentorial venous collateral pathways is proposed as a possible explanation for the findings.
