Cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT) is an increasingly recognized cause of neurological morbidity and mortality within the pediatric population. Unlike its manifestation in the adult population, CSVT in children has a broad and often multifactorial cause. Our case describes an 18-month-old young boy presenting to the emergency department twice during a 48-hour period with vomiting and lethargy. The child was found to have a sagittal sinus venous thrombosis caused by severe dietary iron deficiency anemia. Severe iron deficiency anemia has been linked to CSVT formation in several recent case reports.
