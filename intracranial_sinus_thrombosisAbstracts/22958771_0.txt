Multifocal cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) has a high mortality rate especially when patients present with stupor or coma. Medical treatment including anticoagulation raises concerns about the associated high risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. Treatment of multifocal CVST with mechanical thrombectomy devices and local tPA infusion have previously been reported. However, these devices may have technical limitations. Success of the new-generation aspiration thrombectomy device like the Penumbra system has been reported in few cases of isolated CVST without the use of chemical thrombolysis. We describe two cases in which mechanical thrombectomy were used in conjunction with intra-sinus tPA infusion. Both cases were complicated and failed initial anticoagulation. Penumbra 054 was used in both cases. The Penumbra 054 is a novel device that has a bigger lumen which provides compatibility with other microcatheters, if additional therapies are required. The larger internal diameter of this catheter also allows for stronger thrombo-aspiration, potentially effecting more rapid sinus recanalization. Both cases showed remarkable clinical recovery without any major complications. This is the first reported simultaneous use of the Penumbra system 054 along with tPA infusion. New devices such as the Penumbra system may offer additional therapeutic options in the treatment of multifocal CVST.
