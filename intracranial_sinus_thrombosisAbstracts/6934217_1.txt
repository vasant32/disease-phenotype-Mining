Life-threatening infection after the extraction of the right maxillary and mandibular third molars, and the minimal early treatment of the ensuing complications, has been described. Perhaps, if proper incision and drainage and adequate antibiotic treatment had been instituted immediately after extraction, the ensuing complications could have been avoided. There will never be total agreement regarding the optimal time to surgically remove a tooth. The latter is based on individual preferences, past experiences, and clinical successes of the practitioner. However, if extraction is decided on, the surgeon must be able to recognize the early development of complications and institute appropriate treatment.
