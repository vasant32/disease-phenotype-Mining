Cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis (CVT) is a rare but potentially alarming condition, which remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Endovascular procedure may be a therapeutic option when evolution is unfavourable despite medical treatment, but the use of stenting is rarely reported in CVT treatment. We report the case of a man who presented a jugular vein thrombosis responsible for severe intracranial hypertension. Because of clinical worsening despite intravenous heparin and symptomatic treatment, endovascular procedure including the placement of five venous stents, thrombolysis and balloon angioplasty, was performed and led to venous recanalization with successful clinical outcome. The patient is still asymptomatic 3 years later. Our report shows that venous stenting could represent an efficient alternative in the management of decoagulation refractory CVT.
