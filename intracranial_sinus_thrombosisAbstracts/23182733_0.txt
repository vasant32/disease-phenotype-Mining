OBJECTIVE: Patients with cerebral sinus and cortical venous thrombosis develop venous infarcts in approximately 50% of cases, resulting in serious clinical symptoms. An animal model is needed to further clarify the underlying mechanisms and consequences surrounding cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, particularly for severe ones. METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used to develop a new superior sagittal sinus thrombosis model involving cortical veins. The superior sagittal sinus was exposed and ligated. A microcatheter was inserted into the sinus, then both common carotid arteries were temporary occluded to reduce cerebral blood flow, and thrombin was injected into the sinus. Twenty-four hours later, after evaluating neurological function and obtaining an MRI, animals were sacrificed and data pertaining to brain water content, infarct volume and tissue histology was collected. RESULTS: Superior sagittal sinus thrombosis and brain infarction were detected in all rats (100%). Hemorrhagic infarction, when present, and brain edema were observed in the brain parenchyma of the parietal lobe. The rate of hemorrhage was 59%, which is similar to that seen clinically in patients with superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. Brain edema, as measured by brain water content percentage, was significantly increased in thrombosed animals compared to sham-operated animals (80.8 ± 0.55% vs. 78.8 ± 0.14%, p<0.05). Infarct volumes were 53.02 ± 7.91 mm(3). CONCLUSION: We suggest that our modified model of superior sagittal sinus thrombosis, involving cortical veins, is suitable for the study of its underlying mechanisms, as well as therapeutic approaches directed at the disease.
