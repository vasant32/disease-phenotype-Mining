This paper describes the case of a male child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who developed cerebral sinovenous thrombosis on day 6 of induction therapy with intrathecal methotrexate and methylprednisolone. A central venous catheter had been implanted the day before. The heterozygous prothrombin G20210A variant was found together with acquired activated protein C resistance and a reduced activated partial thromboplastin time. Clinical course and magnetic resonance imaging with magnetic resonance venography gradually improved over the following days after starting anticoagulant therapy (heparin and nadroparin). Cerebral sinovenous thrombosis is a serious disease in leukemic children, occurring in up to 6% of these patients. Data from the literature are in favor of anti-coagulant treatment, even though the efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis during chemotherapy in leukemic children with inherited thrombophilic conditions remain to be demonstrated.
