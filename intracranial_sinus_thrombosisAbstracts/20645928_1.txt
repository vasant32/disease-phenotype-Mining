 AIM: To evaluate the long-term outcome of childhood stroke in a population-based cohort of Swedish children. METHODS: We followed up children with stroke over 7 years from 2000 to 2006 in a health care region covering one-fifth of the Swedish population. Children aged between 28 days and 18 years, who had arterial ischaemic stroke, cerebral sinus venous stroke or nontraumatic haemorrhagic stroke, were included. The long-term outcome study 1.6-8.6 years later included a clinical investigation, evaluation of school performance, everyday activities and participation and health-related quality of life questionnaires (International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, Child Health Questionnaire and Short-Form General Health Survey). RESULTS: Of 51 children, 4 (8%) had died and 85% of the long-term survivors had some acquired impairment: 65% of the children had neurological impairment, and 59% had deficits affecting school activity and participation. The parents experienced the negative effect of the stroke on their child's general health, daily life activities and participation and also on their own family life. CONCLUSION: Childhood stroke results in serious long-term functional deficits in 85% of survivors affecting their everyday life, the child's performances and the life of the family as a whole.
