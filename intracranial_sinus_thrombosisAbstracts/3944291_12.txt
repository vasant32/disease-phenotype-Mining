High field magnetic resonance (MR) imaging enables us to demonstrate the evolution of cerebral venous thrombosis. Initially, absence of a flow void and collateral venous channels are seen on T1 weighted images (WI). On T2WI thrombus appears hypointense. Hyperintensity is noted in an intermediate stage of thrombosis first on T1WI and later on T2WI. In the late stages recanalization of the vessel occurs with reappearance of the flow void. These findings are specific for venous thrombosis. High field MR may be the imaging modality of choice in the diagnosis of venous thrombosis.
