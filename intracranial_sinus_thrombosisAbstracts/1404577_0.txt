Intracranial complications from otitis media can be quite devastating to the patient if an early diagnosis is not made. Patients may develop meningitis, venous sinus thrombosis or cranial nerve palsies, as well as intracranial abscess. The presenting features in such cases may be subtle and include headache, nausea, vomiting, personality changes and signs of increased intracranial pressure as well as focal neurological deficits.

Delay in the diagnosis of intracranial complications of otitis media can lead to improper treatment with increased morbidity and mortality. The etiology and treatment of complications affecting the CNS is discussed.
