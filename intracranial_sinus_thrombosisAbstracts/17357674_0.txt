Cytomegalovirus (CMV) belongs to Herpesvirida family and it occurs quite frequently in the human environment. It is a very important pathogen in persons with suppressed or lowered resistance. Having special kindship with epithelium, it may cause primary infection or reveal secondary influence in the latent form. Congenital CMV infection is a major cause of sensorineural hearing loss and neurological impairment in children. Otogenic complications may develop in patients with viral infection immunodeficiency. Aim of the paper was assessment of lateral sinus thrombosis (LST) in children with acute otitis media (AOM) and CMV infection. Authors present a case of LST in 5-year old child with AOM with mastoiditis and acquired CMV infection. In the first phase a disease appeared as mononucleosis-like infection with developing neurological signs resulting from meningitis. In the second phase the signs of acute otitis media, mastoiditis and lateral sinus thrombosis increased. Despite broad spectrum antibiotics therapy the intracranial complication developed which was surgically treated with good outcome. All the symptoms resulting from mastoiditis, LST and meningitis ceased. Clinical symptoms of the secondary CMV infection are rare in children. Complications may develop despite proper treatment of the ear and throat infections, and may result from immunodeficiency after CMV infection.
