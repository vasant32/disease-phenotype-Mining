In order to study the role of Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR imaging in dural sinus thrombosis, precontrast and postcontrast imaging using Gd-DTPA in three patients with clinically unsuspected dural sinus thrombosis was reviewed. Comparisons were made with cranial CT scanning and cerebral angiography. Compared to CT, the postcontrast T1-weighted images more clearly revealed thrombus in the dural sinuses as a nonenhanced central area of intermediate intensity (but not flow void) surrounded by an enhanced rim. MR imaging also demonstrated secondary changes, including the presence of collateral venous channels and venous infarction.
