A 62-year-old man was admitted because of progressive visual impairment since 2 months ago. Ophthalmological examination revealed impaired visual acuity with papillary edema in both eyes. Right carotid angiograms showed dural arteriovenous fistulas of the lateral sinus mainly fed by the right occipital artery. On the angiograms, the right transverse sinus was completely occluded. Endovascular embolization via jugular vein and via occipital artery was performed. Dural AVF disappeared and visual acuity was improved with normalized intracranial tension.
