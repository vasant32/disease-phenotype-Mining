A 36-year-old female presented with dural sinus thrombosis manifesting as marked enlargement of the venous sinus, which could not be differentiated from epidural hematoma on computed tomography during the acute phase. Magnetic resonance imaging showed characteristic serial changes of the thrombus in the healing process. We believe this condition developed from use of oral contraceptives. Systemic anticoagulant therapy was effective without hemorrhagic complication.
