Fusobacterium necrophorum is implicated as an aetiological agent in a variety of necrotic diseases, such as Lemi√®rre's syndrome (LS) in humans. LS was initially described as septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein secondary to an acute oropharyngeal infection. Other primary sources of infection include parotitis, otitis media, sinusitis, odontogenic infection and mastoiditis. In the pre-antibiotic era LS carried a high mortality. This has been reduced as a result of the widespread use of antibiotics, but there is still a definite morbidity and mortality associated with infection with this virulent organism. We report three cases of complicated otitis media caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum. The patients were treated successively with intravenous metronidazole and surgery.
