A case was reported in which the patient, whose leukemic cells were not found in the peripheral blood, died several days after the onset of cerebral sinus thrombosis, and after the autopsy acute leukemia was diagnosed. The patient, a 68-year-old female, was admitted with clouding of the consciousness. In the initial examination, she was semicomatose, pendulum-like movement was seen in the eyeballs, and hemorrhagic maculae on the trunk and extremities. Among the laboratory findings, WBC was 8, 100 (B 1, St 6, S 77, L 14, Mon 2), RBC 375 x 10(4), Hb 12.5, Ht 37, PLT 3.5 x 10(4), PT 15.6, PTT 68, Fib 158, FDP 10 and AT-III 75. In contrast enhanced CT, an empty triangular sign was observed. On the third hospital day, the patient died of a cerebral hernia. On autopsy, thrombosis was found in the bilateral sigmoid sinus. In the cerebral tissue, congestion was throughout the brain, and many leukemic cells were seen in the dilated blood vessels, but there was no infiltration into the parenchyma. The bone marrow, hypercellular, showed many intermediate type and blastic myeloid cells. The main neurological complications of leukemia are leukemic infiltration and intracranial hemorrhages. Capillary obstructions associated with the disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) syndrome are rarely experienced, but obstructions of thick arteries or thick veins such as venous sinuses are seldom seen in general, and most reports of such cases were those resulting from chemotherapy after making a diagnosis of acute leukemia. In the literature, there have been only two reports in our literature.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
