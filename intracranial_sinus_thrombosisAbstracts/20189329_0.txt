Septic thrombophlebitis caused by head and neck infection has become a rare disorder due to the development of antibiotics. We report herein two cases of septic thrombophlebitis of the head and neck. Case 1 was a 7-year-old girl, who presented with fever, otalgia, and headache. Acute otitis media was diagnosed in another hospital. A computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated mastoiditis with thrombophlebitis of the right lateral and sigmoid sinuses. Case 2 was a 39-year-old woman, who presented with left neck pain, fever chills and severe pharyngalacia. Peritonsillar abscess was diagnosed. A CT scan demonstrated a left internal jugular vein thrombus in addition to multiple pulmonary nodules with emboli. A diagnosis of Lemierre's syndrome was made based on these findings. Both cases were successfully treated by intravenous antibiotics. A lack of awareness of these conditions and a delayed diagnosis may lead to potentially fatal consequences. A clinical suspicion of septic thrombophlebitis seems to be essential to make an accurate diagnosis during the early stage of the disease and archive a successful outcome.
