OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of individualized endovascular treatment on cerebral venous thrombosis of different types. METHODS: 168 patients with cerebral venous thrombosis underwent individualized endovascular treatment: direct thrombolysis via internal jugular vein in 26 cases, injection of urokinase via common carotid artery in 98 cases, stent angioplasty in venous sinus in 9, simple anticoagulant therapy in 20 cases, and treating combined intracranial hemorrhage simultaneously in 15 cases. Follow-up was conducted for 6-168 months. RESULTS: Follow-up showed that the effective rate was 97.6%, recurrence rate was 6.6%, complication incidence rate was 1.2%, and death rate was 0.6%. Venous sinus recanalization occurred and primary drainage rebounded in most eases. Lateral drainage was strengthened in some cases whose venous sinuses did not recover ideally. The symptoms of most cases were alleviated along with the decrease of intracranial pressure. CONCLUSION: Individualized endovascular treatment based on the characteristics of the disease is effective in treatment of cerebral venous thrombosis.
