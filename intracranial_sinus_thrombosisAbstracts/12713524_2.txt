OBJECTIVES: The main aim of the present study was to assess long-term neurological and cognitive outcome in patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). METHODS: We re-investigated by means of a face to face interview all patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CVST, collected at our Department over the years 1990-2000. During the interview the presence of headache, epileptic seizures, visual deficits and a new episode following the first occurrence of CVST were checked. Moreover all patients underwent a neurological examination, a functional evaluation, a cognitive assessment to rule out aphasia, apraxia and working memory deficits. Depression of mood was also investigated. RESULTS: On the whole 34 patients entered the study: 10 patients referred episodic headache following the disease. In three cases epileptic seizures were present. A new event occurred in only one patient. Four patients showed pyramidal signs, in two cases visual deficits were present. All patients had no functional disability. We found a mild non-fluent aphasia in three patients, working memory deficits in six patients and depression of mood in six cases. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates a good neurological and cognitive long-term outcome in patients with CVST.
