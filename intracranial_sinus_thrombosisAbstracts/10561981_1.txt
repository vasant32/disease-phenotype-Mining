The authors describe a case of rhinosino-orbital mucormycosis with cavernous sinus thrombosis in association with internal carotid artery occlusion diagnosed by use of computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cranial CT is a useful imaging tool in the diagnosis of rhinosinal invasive fungal disease and MRI offers excellent aid in the detection of intracranial extension. Early diagnosis and rapid institution of surgical debridement and antifungal therapy is the rule of thumb in treating this disorder. In our patient, surgically inaccessible bone lesion and involvement of the central nervous system are taken as major causes for his grave outcome. In addition, failure to advance appropriate amphotericin B dosage may also make the infectious process uncontrollable in this patient.
