Dural sinus thrombosis, a relatively rare disease, is difficult to diagnose because of variable symptomatic manifestations. We successfully treated a case of dural sinus thrombosis by direct thrombolysis using an endovascular technique in combination with postoperative anticoagulant therapy. The patient, a 19-year-old female, developed a headache affecting her whole head on December 13, 1993. She was admitted to our hospital the next day. Neurological examination upon admission revealed no neurological abnormalities, nor was there any abnormality in CT scan, either plain or enhanced, taken on the day of admission. The patient's consciousness deteriorated in the early morning of December 22. MRI and cerebral angiography revealed thrombi from the confluence of the sinuses to the right transverse and sigmoid sinus, with disturbed circulation through deep cerebral veins. Systemic thrombolytics, steroid and mannitol were started, but, on the next day, the third ventricle was compressed by bilateral swelling of the basal ganglia, with hydrocephalus. Since her consciousness deteriorated further despite ventricular drainage and barbiturate therapy, direct thrombolytic therapy was performed on December 25. A catheter was placed in the superior sagittal sinus, and 600,000 units of urokinase was locally injected, followed by postoperative anticoagulant therapy. The patient's condition improved rapidly. On CT scan, the bilateral swelling of the basal ganglia disappeared along with the hydrocephalus. At about 1 month after endovascular surgery, MRI and cerebral angiography revealed recanalization of the deep cerebral veins, straight sinus and confluence of sinuses with improved opacification of the left transverse sinus, although the right transverse sinus was found to be re-occluded.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
