Until now, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) was principally an autopsy diagnosis; however, with the introduction of MRI and angiography, as well as enhanced clinical attentiveness, it is now reliably diagnosed during life. Herein, we describe a case of CVST accompanied by oligodendroglioma and pregnancy. In our patient, the following factors contributed to the formation of CVST: First, the pregnancy state, which is a known risk factor for developing venous thrombosis; and secondly, the oligodendroglioma could have changed the architecture of adjacent sinus (right lateral sinus) and provocation of the development of clot in the sinus.
