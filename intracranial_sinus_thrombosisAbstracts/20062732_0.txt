We report a rare case of fatal cardiac tamponade attributed to coronary sinus thrombosis. An 83-year-old man was admitted to the hospital complaining of general fatigue. Laboratory examination revealed marked increase of atypical lymphoblastic cells in peripheral blood. CHOP therapy was started under the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The patient died, however, of sudden cardiac arrest in the initial course of the chemotherapy. Autopsy revealed cardiac tamponade with markedly dilated and congested coronary vein induced by coronary sinus thrombosis. A condition similar to leukemia-related venous thromboembolic disease, combined with endothelial damage induced by leukemic infiltration, may cause this rare complication.
