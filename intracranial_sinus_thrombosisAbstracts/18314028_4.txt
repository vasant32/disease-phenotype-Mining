We present the case of a 5-year-old boy with otogenic lateral sinus thrombosis that developed after acute mastoiditis, with no prior ear disease. He was treated with myringotomy and antibiotics alone, with no surgical intervention. This approach was followed owing to his good general condition, the prompt response to the antimicrobial treatment, and no evidence of suppurative disease. Sinus recanalization was evident on the follow-up computed tomography 4 months later. We believe that in selected cases of otogenic lateral sinus thrombosis, secondary to an acute ear infection with early response to antibiotic therapy, conservative treatment may be considered and surgical intervention may be withheld.
