Coronary sinus thrombosis is an unusual but potentially serious complication of the use of central venous devices. We report a fatal case of coronary sinus thrombosis in relation to a malpositioned central venous catheter. The death occurred very soon following the beginning of symptoms and the cause could not be suspected. Direct trauma of the catheter on the coronary sinus endothelium seems the most probable cause of the thrombosis.
