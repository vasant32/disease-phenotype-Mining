A rare case of straight sinus thrombosis in a 36-year-old female with sudden onset of status migrainosus is presented. This condition was demonstrated by a linear density in the midline on a noncontrast computed tomography scan, as a filling defect at the location of straight sinus on magnetic resonance imaging, and by the inability to visualize blood flow in the straight sinus on magnetic resonance venography, with a similar demonstration on a 4-vessel digital subtraction angiography.
