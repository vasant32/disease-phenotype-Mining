The author reports on a number of cases of bilateral papilledema of unknown etiology. The condition was presumably caused by a formen virus infection. The symptoms were indicative of increased intracranial pressure; the possibility of a brain tumor therefore had to be ruled out. The results of the neurological examinations were negative and a benign intracranial hypertension was diagnosed. In 20 out of 22 cases neither lasting disturbances of visual nor visual field defects developed as a result of conservative treatment. In two cases--children in whom therapy was only instituted at a late stage--a partial atrophy of the optic nerve developed in spite of the treatment.
