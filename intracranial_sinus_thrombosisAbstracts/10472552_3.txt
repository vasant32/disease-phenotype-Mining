BACKGROUND: The present study was designed to prospectively evaluate the role of prothrombotic risk factors in leukemic children treated according to the ALL-BFM 90/95 study protocols with respect to the onset of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. PATIENTS: 317 consecutive leukemic children aged 6 months to 18 years were enrolled in this study. 288 of the 317 patients were available for thrombosis-free survival analysis. RESULTS: In 17 (5.9%) of these 288 patients cerebral venous sinus thrombosis occurred. The overall event-free survival of thrombosis in the central nervous system in patients with at least one prothrombotic defect (n = 12) was significantly reduced compared with patients without a prothrombotic defect (p < 0.0001). 15 patients showed acute clinical symptoms at onset of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, two were asymptomatic. Three of the 17 patients affected (17.6%) died directly associated with the thrombotic event during induction therapy, the remaining 14 patients did not show prolonged clinical symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Prothrombotic risk factors should be included in a screening program in ALL children treated according to the BFM study protocols. Further prospective studies are recommended to establish adequate prophylactic anticoagulant treatment during ALL (BFM) polychemotherapy.
