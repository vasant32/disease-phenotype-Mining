Although neurological complications are common in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT), cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) has rarely been described. An allograft recipient is described who presented with diplopia and developed CST in the early post-transplant period likely caused by a filamentous fungus. Clinical course and serial radiological studies of this patient are described and correlated with autopsy findings.
