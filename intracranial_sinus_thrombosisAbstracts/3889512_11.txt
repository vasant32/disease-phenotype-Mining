We describe two patients with Behçet's disease who had symptomatic intracranial hypertension due to cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. The sinus thrombosis was demonstrated by digital subtraction angiography. In those patients with Behçet's disease who have unexplained headaches, papilledema, and elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure, venous digital subtraction angiography is an expedient, accurate, and safe procedure for demonstrating intracranial venous thrombosis.
