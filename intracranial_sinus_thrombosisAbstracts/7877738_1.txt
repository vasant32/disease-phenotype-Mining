A 69-year-old man was admitted because of sudden onset of consciousness disturbance. Neurological examination on admission revealed slightly disturbed consciousness, sensory aphasia and right hemiparesis. CT scan disclosed a hematoma in the left posterior temporal lobe. Left carotid angiograms showed dural AVF of the transverse/sigmoid sinus fed mainly by the left occipital and posterior auricular arteries. On the angiograms the left sigmoid sinus was completely occluded. This was associated with retrograde venous flow into the cortical veins, the superior petrosal sinus and the contralateral traverse sinus. After stabilizing the condition, we totally resected the dural AVF including the left transverse sinus. The postoperative course was uneventful. Histopathological examination of the surgically resected specimen revealed that the dural A-V fistula per se existed in the sinus wall.
