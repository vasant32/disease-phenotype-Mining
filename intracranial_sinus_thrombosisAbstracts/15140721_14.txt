Matched mask bone elimination (MMBE) is a technique for the automatic removal of bone pixels from CT angiography data sets. We describe the use of this technique in two patients with the clinical suspicion of dural sinus thrombosis. We conclude that multisection CT venography with MMBE is a useful adjunct for the visualization of the intracranial venous circulation by removing bone from the image. In contrast to techniques described previously, MMBE is fully automated and operator independent.
