Ultrasonographic findings of superior sagittal sinus thrombosis include dilated and hyperechoic sinus (direct imaging of the thrombus). No flow should be demonstrated by the various Doppler techniques. In the deeper sinuses, if the thrombus can not be visualized after a negative Doppler study, MR imaging is recommended. Recanalization and reflow can be demonstrated on follow-up study.
