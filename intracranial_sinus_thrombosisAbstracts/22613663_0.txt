Dural enhancement detected by magnetic resonance imaging is a common finding in patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) and is usually interpreted as a change secondary to CVST. We report two cases of CVST with intense and diffuse dural enhancement that resulted from pachymeningitis in one patient and spontaneous intracranial hypotension in another. Pachymeningitis and spontaneous intracranial hypotension were also determined to be the underlying causes of CVST. The clinical data of these two patients are described. In patients with CVST, dural enhancement is not always a secondary change to CVST. It can be a manifestation of the underlying causes of CVST. When diffuse and intense dural enhancement is revealed, sufficient ancillary tests are warranted to rule out other potential pathological changes of the dura mater those can result in CVST.
