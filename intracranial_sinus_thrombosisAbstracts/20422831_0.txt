Thrombosis of the sinuses is a distinct cerebrovascular disorder that, unlike arterial stroke, most often affects young adults and children. The symptoms and clinical course are highly variable. During the past decade, increased awareness of the diagnosis, improved neuro-imaging techniques, and more effective treatment have improved the prognosis. More than 80% of all patients now have a good neurologic outcome. This review summarizes recent insights into the pathogenesis of sinus thrombosis, risk factors, and clinical and radiological diagnosis and discusses the current evidence and controversies about the best treatment.
