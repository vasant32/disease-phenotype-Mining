Summary: Increased platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate and epinephrine and enhanced platelet activation response to surface contact are the key features of the "sticky platelet syndrome", in which the phenotype is transmitted with an autosomal dominant pattern. Two thirds of the patients with this syndrome have a positive family history of thrombo-embolic disease, which may be triggered by stress. We have seen two patients suffering from intracranial arterial and venous sinus thrombosis due to sticky platelet syndrome. Hyperaggregability of the platelets after stimulation with adenosine diphosphate and epinephrine was found in both. Case 1: A 43 year old man with a superior sagittal and right transverse venous sinus thrombosis developed subdural hygromas and a venous infarct of the parietal lobe. After burr hole evacuation of the hygromas, aspirin and phenoprocumone were prescribed. The patient made a good neurological recovery. Case 2: A 52 year old woman experienced spontaneous occlusion of a right MCA branch. The work-up revealed bilateral MCA and a basilar tip aneurysm. During the attempt to treat the basilar tip aneurysm by endovascular means, a thrombus formed within the left vertebral artery and was dislodged to both posterior cerebral arteries (PCAs). Local intra-arterial fibrinolysis yielded good recanalization of both PCAs. No new neurological deficit occurred. Continuous prophylaxis with aspirin was started. In sticky platelet syndrome stress and adrenaline release can trigger the thrombosis of intracranial arterial or venous vessels in otherwise healthy subjects. This is a potential cause of thromboembolic complications during endovascular procedures. Low-dose aspirin normalizes platelet hyperaggregability.
