We investigated a 56-year-old Japanese man with protein C deficiency, who was referred to our hospital because of venous sinus thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism. Protein C (PC) activity and the corresponding antigen level in plasma were 66% and 106% of the normal values, respectively. Both the activity and antigen levels of protein C were reduced by approximately 50% in plasma from the patient's mother. All exons and their flanking intron regions were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA. Sequencing analysis of the PCR fragments revealed that the patient was heterozygous for a C to T substitution at nucleotide position 6218, resulting in a single amino acid substitution of arginine (CGG) by tryptophan (TGG) at codon 169 of the heavy chain. We analyzed the patient, his mother, and normal controls by a Sac II digestion study of exon 7 and found that the patient and his mother had the same C to T point mutation at base 6218. This mutation could have been responsible for the defective activation of the molecule and the resulting thrombotic disorder. The patient is now being treated with warfarin, and so far no further clinical thrombotic episode has occurred.
