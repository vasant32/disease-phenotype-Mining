 UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND, PATIENT RESPECTIVELY AND METHODS: Based on a case-report we demonstrate which symptoms are indicative of a cerebral sinus-venous thrombosis, how it can develop, and which diagnostic and therapeutic methods are available. RESULTS: Cerebral sinus-venous thrombosis in puerperium can be hidden behind unspecific symptoms like strong headache, nausea, vomiting. Literature reorts varying mortality between 5 and 30%. CONCLUSIONS: The obstetrician has to be attentive whenever these symptoms appear for the course and prognosis decisively depend on a quick diagnosis by means of computertomography and angiography. DISCUSSION: Blood coagulation disorders such as lack of Antithrombin III, protein C, or protein S, have been identified as a particularly important origin of the cerebral sinus-venous thrombosis. It is subject to discussion whether the patient should be advised against any further pregnancy. From a medical point of view, a subsequent pregnancy seems acceptable because the risk of another thrombosis, which is a rare event anyway, can be significantly reduced by providing anticoagulation substances.
