Dural sinus thrombosis in the newborn period has been infrequently documented and its clinical presentation remains obscure. Seventeen patients, all of whom were born at term with dural sinus thrombosis diagnosed in the neonatal period, were retrospectively identified and reviewed. Diagnosis was determined by unenhanced computed tomography which demonstrated a dense sagittal sinus with concomitant small ventricles. Two patients had ancillary studies (i.e., cerebral angiography and nuclear flow scan) which confirmed the diagnosis. Only 4 patients had evidence of perinatal asphyxia. Three patients were identified as having associated conditions known to predispose them to dural sinus thrombosis. None of the patients tested had an identifiable hypercoagulable state. Neonatal seizures were the initial presentation in 15 patients. Seizure onset predominantly occurred during the first week of life. Subsequent examinations were available in all 17 patients and ranged up to 6 years. Only 3 patients had seizures beyond the neonatal period. In 11 of 12 infants with no history of perinatal asphyxia, neurodevelopmental outcomes were normal. Two of 4 infants with perinatal asphyxia had neurologic sequelae. Dural sinus thrombosis represents an important and under-recognized cause of neonatal seizures in term infants. In the absence of perinatal asphyxia, normal neuro-developmental outcome is likely and the risk of seizure recurrence is low.
