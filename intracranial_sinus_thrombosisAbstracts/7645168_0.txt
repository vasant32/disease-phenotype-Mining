Arterial aneurysms of the infraclinoid part of the internal carotid artery manifest by Jefferson's I-II syndrome. Similar symptoms are observed in intracranial processes of other origin developing in the immediate vicinity from this portion of the internal carotid artery. The manifestation and type of these symptoms depend on the extension of the pathological process, its localization, and individual anatomic structure of oculomotor nerves.
