Hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis is a rare chronic fibrosing inflammatory disease characterised by localized or diffuse thickening of duramater, leptomeninges, and tentorium. The etiology is diverse and includes infectious, granulomatous and inflammatory disorders, collagen vascular disorders, carcinoma, lymphoma, meningioma en plaque, sarcoidosis, haemodialysis, mucopolysaccharidosis, intrathecal drug administration, and meningeal carcinomatosis diseases. Intracranial hypotension is also an important image mimicker. Most often patients present with complaint of headache, vomiting, cranial nerve palsy, ataxia, raised intracranial pressure and focal neurological deficit. Other signs and symptoms are inconstant and variable. The imaging features of hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis include dural thickening, dural mass, sinus thrombosis, venous congestion with white matter changes. Extensive preoperative imaging studies usually are essential by Computerised Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The radiological findings may be characteristic of hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis, may not divulge the underlying etiology. Meningeal biopsy is essential for diagnosing the cause. We reviewed a case of a tuberculous hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis.
