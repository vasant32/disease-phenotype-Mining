Cysticercosis is a frequent parasitic infection in developing countries including Nepal and is related to poverty, ignorance and pig-rearing practices at home in the community. A variety of structural involvements such as brain parenchyma, cerebellum, ventricular system, brain stem, meninges, subarachnoid space, spinal cord and orbit have been reported, but cysticercus involving the lateral sinus causing thrombosis is extremely rare.
