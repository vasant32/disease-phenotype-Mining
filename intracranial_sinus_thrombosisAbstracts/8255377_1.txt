A case of sinus thrombosis occurring during combination chemotherapy with CDDP and VP-16 (PE) for a suprasellar germ-cell tumor is presented. A 5-year-old girl developed polyuria, polydipsia and headache in April, 1991 and became unconscious on May 10, 1991, when MRI and CT demonstrated a suprasellar tumor and marked hydrocephalus. After a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt operation, radiotherapy and two courses of PE therapy were carried out. During the second course of PE therapy, diabetes insipidus became quite difficult to control and severe hypovolemic hypernatremia developed. While it was being treated, the patient developed a clonic convulsion of her left extremities and visual disturbance. CT scan demonstrated a right parietal hemorrhagic infarction and IV-DSA suggested thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus. Laboratory data disclosed DIC. The main cause of sinus thrombosis in this patient was considered severe dehydration. It is also possible that cisplatin and steroid played a role. In addition to these, dysfunction of hypothalamus, which is one of the regulatory centers of the plasma concentration of factor VIII, may have contributed to the acceleration of blood coagulation. This case re-emphasized the importance of preventing dehydration and monitoring the blood coagulation fibrinolytic system during PE therapy in patients with a suprasellar germ-cell tumor accompanied with diabetes insipidus.
