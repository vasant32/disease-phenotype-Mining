Background: Cerebral venous-sinus thrombosis is an uncommon form but important cause of stroke, especially in young-aged women.Methods: We performed a retrospective descriptive-analytical study in which 124 patients with cerebral venous-sinus thrombosis, who referred to Nemazee Hospital, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences from January 2000 to March 2008, were included, and their demographic, etiologic, radiological and prognostic characteristics were evaluated.Results: The patients' mean age was 34.01Â±10.25. Eighty seven (70.16%) were women and 37 (29.83%) were men. The most frequent clinical manifestations were headache, papilledema and seizures. Fifty seven (65.51%) women took oral contraceptive pills. Twenty of 57 women (35.08%) took the pill longer than one month to be able to fast in Ramadan or perform the Hajj ceremonies. In the mean time they developed cerebral venous-sinus thrombosis. Superior sagital sinus, with or without lateral sinuses, was the most involved area (70.96%). High mortality and morbidity rates (14.51% and 35.48%, respectively) were found in patients. Poor prognostic factors at the time of admission were stupor and coma (P=0.001) and evidence of hemorrhage in primary CT scan (P=0.005).Conclusion: Taking oral contraceptive pills was a main factor associated with cerebral venous-sinus thrombosis. Clinical manifestations, prognostic factors, common involved sinuses and image findings of this study were similar to those of other studies. Health care policy makers should design a plan to warn susceptible women of the risk of cerebral venous-sinus thrombosis, and to educate them the ways to prevent it.
