A 19 year-old female presented with sudden onset of severe headache and photophobia. Clinical examination, blood tests and lumbar puncture were unremarkable.The patient was taking drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol oral contraceptives. An unenhanced computed tomography (CT) was performed with findings suspicious for sinus thrombosis. A confirmatory CT venography was made, which was diagnostic for sinus thrombosis. Thrombophilia screening was performed and showed normal values. Estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives was the only risk factor, and this therapy has venous thrombosis as a rare side effect.
