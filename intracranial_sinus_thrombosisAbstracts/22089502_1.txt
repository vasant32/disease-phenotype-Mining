Management of the pregnant woman with a neuro-ophthalmic disorder may be challenging. Physiologic changes in pregnancy make vascular conditions more frequent, including retinal artery occlusion, spontaneous orbital hemorrhage, and pituitary apoplexy. Papilledema may signal cerebral venous sinus thrombosis or idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Manifestations of severe preeclampsia and eclampsia include choroidal infarction, serous retinal detachment, and disorders of higher cortical function, such as alexia, simultanagnosia, and cerebral blindness. Cranial neuropathies have also been reported. Transient Horner syndrome, intracranial hypotension with comitant esotropia may occur in the postpartum period. Treatment of the neuro-ophthalmic complications of pregnancy requires an understanding of the risks of medications. Taking optimal care of the mother will usually result in the best care for her baby.
