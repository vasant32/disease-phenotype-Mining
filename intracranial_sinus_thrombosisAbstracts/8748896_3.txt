A 50-year-old woman with idiopathic deep cerebral sinus and vein thrombosis (DCVT) had cerebellar disturbance prior to impaired consciousness. CT and MRI revealed haemorrhagic infarction in the cerebellum and signal changes suggesting infarction in the thalamus and basal ganglia bilaterally. The straight sinus and internal cerebral vein (ICV) were dense on CT. On angiography, the vein of Galen (VG) and straight sinus were not seen. Following clinical recovery, CT and MRI became normal, and angiography showed recanalization of the VG and ICV. The relationship between cerebellar infarction and DCVT, and signal changes on CT and MRI are discussed.
