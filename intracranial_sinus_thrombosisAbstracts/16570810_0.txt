 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical manifestations and treatment methods of sphenoid sinus diseases with intracranial and/or orbital complications, to provide reference for their diagnosis and treatment. METHOD: The manifestations and operative ways of sphenoid sinus diseases with cranial/orbital complications in 35 cases were retrospectively analyzed. RESULT: There were 5 cases with meningitis, 3 cases with cavernous sinus thrombosis, 2 cases with pituitary abscess, 1 case with multiple intracranial abscess, 17 cases with optic neuritis, 8 cases with abduction nerve paralysis, 2 cases with orbital apex syndrome. All the patients underwent endoscopic sphenoid sinus surgery, three of them died of brain stem failure and carcinoma. CONCLUSION: Sphenoid sinus disease may lead to severe complications if the diagnosis and treatment have be delayed.
