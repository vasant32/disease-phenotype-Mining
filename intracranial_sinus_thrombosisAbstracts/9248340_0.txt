A 43-year-old woman was suffered from an increasing headache with nausea and vomiting for nine days. She had received danazol 400 mg daily for endometriosis last two months. CT scan and neurological examinations revealed no evidence of abnormality. MRI showed isosignal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images in the superior sagittal, right transverse, sigmoid and straight sinuses suggesting thrombosis. With angiography, we confirmed extensive dural sinus thrombosis in the superior sagittal, straight, right transverse and sigmoid sinuses. She, then, developed progressing neurological deterioration with dysarthria and drowsy. Microcatheter was placed directly into the thrombus at dural sinus via transfemoral route. Thrombolytic therapy with urokinase was performed in right transverse, confluens sinuum, superior sagittal and straight sinuses. Successful recanalization with remarkable improvement of symptoms was achieved except right transverse sinus. We believe danazol played a role in the occurrence of dural sinus thrombosis. MRI and MRV were noninvasive and useful for diagnosis and follow-up of dural sinus thrombosis. Direct thrombolysis should be considered for dural sinus thrombosis, especially when clinical symptoms are rapidly deterioration with conventional anticoagulant therapy.
