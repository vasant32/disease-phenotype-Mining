BACKGROUND: We report an unusual case, which may provide insight into the etiology and pathogenesis of dural arteriovenous malformation. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 24-year-old woman presented with hemorrhage into a pilocytic astrocytoma of the collicular plate. Angiography was normal and the tumor was surgically resected. She developed sigmoid sinus thrombosis and a transverse/sigmoid sinus dural arteriovenous fistula 11 months after this and was found to have protein S deficiency. The fistula was not treated. Angiography 4 years later was unchanged. CONCLUSION: This report illustrates an acquired etiology of a dural arteriovenous fistula. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of postoperative sigmoid sinus thrombosis along with arteriovenous fistula in a patient with previously undetected protein S deficiency.
