BACKGROUND: The management of intracranial dural sinuses thrombosis is still controversial and uncertain. The authors report the cases of 7 patients with non-traumatic thrombosis of the dural sinuses and describe the most important radiographic findings, the indication, effectiveness of antithrombotic therapy, and outcome. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of 7 cases of dural sinus thrombosis admitted, between 1994 and 1996, to our division. All patients underwent full anticoagulation therapy. Heparin was administered, using a dose of 25,000 units/day for two weeks; warfarin was given using a dose of 5 mg twice daily. Treatment course was followed by maintenance treatment with a single administration of 5 mg/day of warfarin. All patients were submitted to close titration and coagulation profile monitoring. RESULTS: In 4 cases Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Angiography (Angio-MRI) was performed for following up the recanalization of the sinuses, resulting a persistent no patency of the dural sinuses. Three patients underwent contrast-enhanced CT scan, demonstrated an "empty delta sign" in the sagittal sinus, confirming no recanalization. Nevertheless, six patients had have a good quality recovery, and one patient a moderate disability. DISCUSSION: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is an uncommon cause of cerebral infarction, and may be mistaken, unless specifically sought. The natural history of the disease is highly variable, with a mortality rates range from 10% to 20%. At present, in our opinion, the venous phase of Angio-MRI is the definitive examination, and a gold standard for diagnosis of dural sinus thrombosis. In our cases, antithrombotic therapy has been found to be a safe and effective treatment, despite contrast-CT scans and Angio-MRI showed no recanalization of the sinuses, in all patients.
