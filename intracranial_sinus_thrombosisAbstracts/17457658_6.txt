In this report, we described two male patients with Hughes-Stovin syndrome. The first patient was a 26-year-old male who initially presented with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right lower limb followed shortly by hemoptysis. Pulmonary CT angiography revealed bilateral pulmonary artery aneurysms secondary to underlying pulmonary vasculitis. While the second case was a 16-year-old male patient who initially presented with generalized fits due to sagittal sinus thrombosis and later followed by DVT in the left lower limb. Pulmonary CT angiography showed small pulmonary artery aneurysms with thrombosis of peripheral pulmonary artery branches. Both patients were treated successfully with steroids and immunosuppressive therapy and showed clinical improvement.
