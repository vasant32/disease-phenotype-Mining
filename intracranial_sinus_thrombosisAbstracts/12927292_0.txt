Before the antibiotic era, lateral sinus thrombosis (LST) was the most frequent complication of otitis media. With the widespread usage of antibiotics, its occurrence is rare. Nevertheless, it is still a major complication of middle ear disease. LST mortality fluctuates between 5 and 35%. The major clinical symptoms of patients with LST are pain in the mastoid region, spiking fever, anemia and general health disorders. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and angiography are the most helpful in diagnosis, but the final diagnosis is made by surgical exploration. Three cases with LST are presented, and signs, diagnosis and treatment of disease are discussed.
