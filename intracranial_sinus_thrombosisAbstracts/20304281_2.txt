OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of middle ear floor reconstruction in management of vascular tinnitus due to high jugular bulb with dehiscent middle ear floor. STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review. SETTING: Tertiary academic medical center. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of seven patients with high dehiscent jugular bulb, presenting with incapacitating pulsatile roaring tinnitus that was abolished by digital compression of the ipsilateral jugular vein, from January 2002 to December 2006. The diagnosis was confirmed by CT scan of the temporal bone (bone window, coronal views). The seven patients were surgically explored, five under local anesthesia (to monitor the results with possible intraoperative revision) and two under general endotracheal anesthesia, for middle ear floor reconstruction that was done using bone dust, perichondrium, and tragal cartilage (mean follow-up 28 months). RESULTS: Of the seven patients, tinnitus disappeared in four (57%) and decreased in one. The overall improvement was five of seven (71%). One patient had postoperative increased intracranial pressure. CONCLUSION: The preliminary results suggest that surgical reconstruction of the middle ear floor under local anesthesia offers valuable treatment for patients with incapacitating tinnitus due to dehiscent middle ear floor. However, the risk of sigmoid sinus thrombosis should be considered. To our knowledge, this is the first trial of multilayer reconstruction of the middle ear floor dehiscence to manage high jugular bulb causing tinnitus.
