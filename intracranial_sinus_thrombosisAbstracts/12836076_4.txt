A 69-year-old female complained of headache and tinnitus. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography showed a tumour in the right transverse sinus extending to the transverse-sigmoid sinus junction, a dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF), and right transverse-sigmoid sinus thrombosis with the downstream from the right sigmoid sinus involved by the tumour. Right external carotid angiography showed the tumour to be supplied by many branches of the right occipital artery, the posterior branches of the middle meningeal artery, and the posterior auricular artery, and the dural AVF fed by the occipital artery and the meningeal branches of the right vertebral artery. She underwent surgery via a combined right supra- and infratentorial approach. The tumour had invaded and blocked the right transverse sinus, which was resected. After surgery the patient was free of headache and tinnitus was diminished. Histological examination found that the tumour was a fibrous meningioma and that the orifice of the vein at the transverse sinus was blocked by the tumour. Serial follow-up cerebral angiography 2 months after surgery showed no change in the AVF, but 9 months after surgery confirmed disappearance of the AVF. This AVF was caused by occlusion of the right transverse sinus by the meningioma and was an acquired lesion.
