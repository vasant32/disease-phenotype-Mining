OBJECTIVES: Review the clinical signs and symptoms, management, bacteriology and outcomes of patients treated for lateral sinus thrombosis. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of six patients, treated from 1993 through 1998, with an intraoperatively confirmed diagnosis of lateral sinus thrombosis. METHODS: All charts from 1993 through 1998 coded for sinus thrombosis, meningitis, brain abscess, otitic hydrocephalus, subdural abscess, and mastoidectomy were reviewed. Operative reports, radiological examinations, laboratory data, culture data and other pertinent data were reviewed. RESULTS: The presenting symptoms ranged from headache to mental status changes. All patients had a history of chronic ear disease and all had at least one additional intracranial complication. The range of additional intracranial complications included otitic hydrocephalus, epidural abscess, and brain abscess. All of the infections were polymicrobial, with a predominance of anaerobes. There were no mortalities; morbidities included anacusis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, reoperation, seizures, septic cardiomyopathy, transfusion, ventriculoperitoneal shunt and nutritional supplementation. CONCLUSION: In patients with otologic disease, complaints of headache, earache or photophobia should warrant an evaluation. The presence of lateral sinus thrombosis mandates further investigation for additional intracranial complications. Conservative surgical intervention, consisting of removal of all perisinus infection and needle aspiration of the sinus, has been found to be effective. Lateral sinus thrombosis is an uncommon complication of otitis media, with potentially significant morbidities, necessitating a high index of suspicion.
