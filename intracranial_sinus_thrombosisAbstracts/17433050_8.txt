PURPOSE: Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an under-recognized cause of altered mental status. There are hardly any reported data on NCSE in developing countries. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospectively 210 consecutive patients with altered mental status admitted to neurological intensive care unit (NICU) of a tertiary care center in south India were studied for the frequency of NCSE. All patients were evaluated initially with 60-min emergent EEG (EmEEG) and subsequently by continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring. RESULTS: Of the 210 with altered mental status admitted to NICU, the diagnosis of NCSE was established in 22 (10.5%) patients, in 12 (55%) patients with 60-min EmEEG and in 10 (45%) after cEEG monitoring for 12 to 48 hours. Of the 22 patients with NCSE, 32% had subtle motor phenomena, these were not an initial presenting features, but were apparent during cEEG recording. Acute medical or neurologic etiology was the risk factor in 68% of patients. Central nervous system (CNS) infections and cortical sino-venous thrombosis (CSVT), respectively, accounted for 23% and 14% of the etiologies. Intravenous midazolam terminated NCSE in 19 patients and valproate in 2. Of the 15 patients with acute symptomatic NCSE, 4 (18%) had poor prognosis (3 deaths and one persistent vegetative state). The etiological risk factors in the 9 (41%) patients with excellent outcome included epilepsy (3), remote symptomatic (2), cryptogenic (1), and metabolic and drugs (3). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of NCSE in the current study was comparable with those in prior reports from developed countries. CNS infections accounted for about a fifth of the etiology. Outcome was excellent in patients with nonacute symptomatic NCSE. Initial 60-min EmEEG may be performed in establishing the diagnosis of NCSE, but almost half of patients with NCSE will be missed with this approach.
