 INTRODUCTION: Thrombosis of the cerebral veins and sinus are common causes of stroke. Animal models help us to understand the underlying pathophysiology of this condition. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to evaluate a well-established model for sinus sagittalis (SSS) thrombosis using micro- and nanocomputed tomography (CT) imaging. METHODS: SSS thrombosis was performed in four rats. After contrast perfusion, brains were isolated and scanned using micro-CT at (8 microm)(3) voxel size to generate 3D images of the cerebral vasculature. For more detailed information on vascular perfusion territories, nano-CT imaging was performed to investigate the boundary layer of contrast-enhanced vessels and the occluded veins. The venous and arterial vascular volume fraction and gray scale measurements were obtained in the SSS thrombosis group and compared to controls. The significance of differences in vascular volume fraction and gray scale measurements was tested with analysis of variance. Results were complemented with histology. RESULTS: Micro-CT proved to accurately visualize and differentiate vascular occlusion territories performed in the SSS thrombosis model. Moreover, 3D micro-CT provided quantitative information on arterial and venous vascular volume fraction. Micro-CT imaging enables a total 3D visualization of complications (ventricle rupture) in the SSS thrombosis model. We established gray scale measurements by which focal cerebral ischemia could be radiographically categorized (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Using nano-CT, the interface of contrast-perfused and occluded veins can be visualized. Micro-CT is feasible for analysis and differentiation of perfusion territories in an animal model of focal cerebral ischemia.
