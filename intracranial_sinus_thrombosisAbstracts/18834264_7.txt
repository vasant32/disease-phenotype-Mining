Cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis is an uncommon but potentially lethal event. Although thrombosis accounts for only 1% of all strokes, if it is left untreated patients suffer from continuing headaches, vague neurological complaints, and may even progress to coma and death. New endovascular techniques and technology allow the possibility of more aggressive thrombolysis and thrombectomy in the setting of acute thrombosis. The authors present a case of recanalization of an extensive cerebral thrombosis using a new endovascular retrieval device.
