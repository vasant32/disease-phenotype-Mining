Karl Wittmaack, head of the otology department at Greifswald (1904-1908) and professor of otorhinolaryngology at the universities of Jena (1908-1925) und Hamburg (1926-1946) created a unique histological collection of human and animal temporal bones that is thought to be the largest of its kind in the world. The serial sections of more than 1700 human temporal bones still represent current otological problems--many of which are now rare but are still encountered--such as tuberculosis, lues or diphtheria of the ear. Complications following acute otitis--which were much more frequent and dangerous in the pre-antibiotic era--can be studied in detail. There are numerous cases of labyrinthitis, meningitis, sinus thrombosis, brain abscess etc.--complications which must always be borne in mind to this day. The same is true for tumors like acoustic neurinomas or even malignant tumors, metastases, or manifestations of leukemia. Differences in pneumatization or changes of the bone structure as in otosclerosis have been the subjects of studies dating from Wittmaack's time until very recently. In spite of its topicality, the true value of the collection has only be appreciated by a limited group of persons, which may be due in part to difficulties in orientation within this vast amount of material. Although there are catalogues, it may be difficult to find the appropriate preparations for particular questions. Searching for such specimens often requires rummaging through the whole collection, sometimes resulting in damage or loss of slides or handwritten notes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
