A diabetic man developed a severe hyperosmolar state resulting in coma. CT of the head showed bilateral cerebellar hemorrhages. Despite medical treatment, he deteriorated and died. At autopsy, the straight sinus was thrombosed. There were bilateral, hemorrhagic, cerebellar venous infarctions. This condition is rare because of abundant collateral venous drainage.
