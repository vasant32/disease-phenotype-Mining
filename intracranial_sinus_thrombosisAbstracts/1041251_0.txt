As a casuistic contribution to differential diagnosis of thrombosis of cerebral veins and sinuses a case of occlusion of sinus sagittalis superior by infiltration of an intracerebral metastasis from a teratoma of testis is reported. The leading symptoms - epileptic seizures, progressive hemiplegia, choked papilla and clouding of consciousness - gave rise to the tentative diagnosis of a cerebral tumor; in carotis angiography however, the metastasis was not detected, merely the occlusion of the sinus was demonstrated. Therefore the progress of the syndrome was misinterpreted as caused by an advancement of a venous thrombosis. Only autopsy showed the symptomless primary tumor and its formation of metastases.
