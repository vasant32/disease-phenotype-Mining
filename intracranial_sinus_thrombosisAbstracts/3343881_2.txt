It was thought that sigmoid sinus involvement from middle-ear infection would become a rare clinical entity with the introduction of antibiotics. However, this problem is still prevalent. Twelve hundred eighty cases of mastoid surgery were performed at Ghaem Medical Center and the author's private clinic between January 1978 and December 1985 in Mashad, Iran. In sixteen cases, surgically proven sigmoid sinus involvement was due to a bone eroding process of chronic ear infection. The pattern of the clinical picture is different than in the preantibiotic era.
