Ten patients with suspected abnormalities or thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus were studied by high resolution computed tomography using a thin slice technique after bolus injection. In all patients good visualization of the sinus pathology could be achieved, which correlated exactly with the findings in the 7 angiographically controlled cases.
