Three patients with bilateral subdural effusion, an exclusive manifestation of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), are presented. A possible explanation of this rare occurrence is provided, and the differential therapeutic strategies are discussed. We propose to consider CVST in cases of subdural effusions of obscure origin. Appropriate imaging studies should not be delayed if there is suspicion of sinus thrombosis to enable adequate therapy to be started as soon as possible.
