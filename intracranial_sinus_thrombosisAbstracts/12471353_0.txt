We report two cases of bilateral papilledema in young women. The first patient was 15 years old and had experienced headaches and vomiting for one month, but no visual loss. Cerebral tomodensitometry results were normal, but lumbar puncture showed increased pressure and normal biology. Benign intracranial hypertension was diagnosed. Recent treatment with minocycline for acne vulgaris was the only etiology. Papilledema was totally regressed at 6 weeks, after interruption of the antibiotic treatment. A prescription of acetazolamide was added for a short period of 10 days. The second patient, aged 29 years, presented bilateral papilledema with severe visual loss, with vision limited to light perception with mydriasis of the right eye. Lumbar puncture was not indicated because of a hypophyseal microadenoma revealed on MRI investigation. No other associated abnormalities were observed, in particular, no cerebral sinus thrombosis. Corticotherapy using prednisolone for 72 hours had no clinical effect. Fast visual recovery was obtained with intravenous acetazolamide therapy and was completely resolved at 2 months. Right visual field defects persisted. Minocycline and obesity are recognized as precipitating factors in pseudotumor cerebri syndrome. The literature advocates consideration of surgical treatment by optic nerve sheath fenestration if antiedematous treatment has no effect and the eye is nearly blind.
