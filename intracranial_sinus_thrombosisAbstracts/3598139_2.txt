We present our initial experience with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 301 pediatric patients with a variety of neurologic disorders. MRI does not require ionizing radiation and can be done easily and safely in children. It is equal or superior to computed cranial tomographic (CT) scans in demonstrating most types of pediatric neurologic disorders. MRI is often superior to CT scans in demonstrating intracranial tumors, although both studies are usually abnormal in highly malignant tumors. No clear advantage was shown with either MRI or CT scans for fluid-filled intracranial lesions. Lesions of the brain stem and upper cervical region, such as Chiari malformation, are well delineated by MRI. Increased signal from the paranasal sinuses was frequently evident by MRI, but, in most instances, there was no clinical indication of sinus disease. Large arteries can be visualized as an area of diminished signal, and intracranial hemorrhage, dural sinus thrombosis, and cerebral infarction were demonstrated. The increased anatomic detail pictured by MRI allows the diagnosis of congenital defects, such as agenesis of the corpus callosum or septum pellucidum, that are not always apparent with CT scans. Although our experience with spinal cord lesions was not extensive, fluid-filled lesions within the cord can be reliably demonstrated.
