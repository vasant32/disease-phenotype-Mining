Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a rare cerebral vascular pathology with highly variable clinical features and outcome. The purpose of this report is to describe a case of CVT of the cavernous sinus that presented as painful ophthalmoplegia. A 26-year-old woman with a contraceptive implant for seven months consulted at the Neurology Department of Yalgado Ouedrago hospital for a painful ophthalmoplegia that was initially diagnosed and treated as ophthalmoplegia migraine. One month later, clinical symptoms had progressed to asymmetric muscle weakness in all four limbs, right cerebellum ataxia and involvement of the trigeminal ophthalmic branch. Computerized axial tomography of the brain depicted a zone of unusual contrast extending from the cavernous sinus up to the tentorium cerebelli and a mass effect on the fourth ventricle. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid demonstrated a cellular reaction with 8 lymphocytes and high protein rate (0.64 g/L). The levels of C reactive protein (CRP) and D-Dimeres were elevated: 16.6 mg/L and 0.99 microg/mL respectively. Based on a presumptive diagnosis of CVT, heparin treatment was undertaken and led to almost complete remission of the signs and symptoms. This case again shows the wide range of clinical features and outcomes of CVT that can oscillate between encephalitis, intracranial tumor or infection. As a result, CVT should be considered as a possible diagnosis in patients with focal neurological signs, intracranial hypertension syndrome, loss of consciousness or cavernous sinus syndrome whenever the context is right (post-partum, oestroprogestative, congenital thrombophilia).
