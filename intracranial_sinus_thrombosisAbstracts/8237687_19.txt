Each of two patients presented with a dural arteriovenous fistula involving the transverse sinus. The sinus was thrombosed proximal and distal to the dural arteriovenous fistula with the venous drainage being retrograde through cortical veins. An ipsilateral percutaneous transjugular approach was used in both cases and allowed recanalization of the thrombosed sinus and embolization of the dural arteriovenous fistula with coils. Complete cure was achieved in one patient and 95% reduction in arteriovenous shunting including elimination of the cortical venous reflux in the other. This technique avoided surgical exposure of the sinus.
