A 45 year-old patient presented with an epidermoid carcinoma of the tongue and cranial hypertension. MRI showed dural venous sinus occlusion, without infiltration or compression by a metastatic tumor. Anticoagulation led to recanalization of the occluded sinuses, as shown by the follow-up MRI, three months later. The pathophysiology of these rare paraneoplastic cerebral venous thrombosis is discussed.
