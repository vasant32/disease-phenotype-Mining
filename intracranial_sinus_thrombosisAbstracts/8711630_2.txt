Cerebral sinus and venous thrombosis account for less than 1% of all strokes, but diagnosis is often overlooked due to the variety of clinical syndromes and the variable clinical course. Underlying conditions do not significantly differ from those seen in extracerebral venous thrombosis. Conventional intra-arterial four-vessel angiography was long the only diagnostic technique for confirming diagnosis, but nowadays magnetic resonance imaging and angiography are sufficient in many cases. Full-dose heparin treatment is the therapy of choice and is performed even if an hemorrhagic infarct already exists. If treatment is initiated early, the mortality rate of nonseptic cerebral sinus and venous thrombosis is less than 10%. According to general rules of postthrombotic treatment, patients should be treated with oral anticoagulants for a period of at least three months.
