We reported a 46-year-old woman in whom cerebral sinus thrombosis manifested itself in headache and weakness while she was on an oral estrogen preparation. The neurological examinations revealed monoparesis of the right upper extremity, hyperactive right deep tendon reflex and disturbance of the joint sense, stereognostic sense, two-point discrimination and skin writing sense in the right upper extremity, in addition to tactile extinction. Brain CT showed empty triangle sign. MRI revealed infarction near the left postcentral gyrus and thrombosis of right sigmoid sinus. In the MRA study, there was low signal intensity in the posterior portion of the superior sagittal sinus and right transverse sinus. Short latency SEP in upper extremity showed that the central conduction time was normal, while the amplitude of wave components after N20 was reduced on the right side. Both palms were given bilateral or unilateral pressure stimuli. When event-related potentials (ERP) were evoked, using bilateral stimuli as a rare target, and left unilateral stimuli as a non-target, the P 300 latency was prolonged to 450 msec but was restored to normal with the improvement of tactile extinction. These results seem to suggest that the tactile extinction is ascribable to a disturbance of recognition at the higher brain function level and that ERP can be a useful objective yardstick in the evaluation of extinction phenomenon.
