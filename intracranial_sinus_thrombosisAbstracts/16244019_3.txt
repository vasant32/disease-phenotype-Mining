Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) can present with a headache similar to that after a dural puncture. We report on a patient who developed postural headache after epidural anesthesia for delivery. The headache became more intense during the following 6 days, and the patient had a tonic clonic seizure. A magnetic resonance angiogram demonstrated CSVT, and anticoagulation therapy was started, with resolution of the symptoms over 2 wk. Any postdural-puncture headache that loses its positional character, becomes persistent, or does not improve with a properly performed blood patch should raise the suspicion of CVST.
