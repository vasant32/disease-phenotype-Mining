Three hundred thirty-five cases of acute mastoiditis with complications due to extension of infection beyond the mastoid are reported. Two hundred twenty-four of those presented with intracranial sepsis. Meningitis occurred in 83 cases, brain abscess in 53, extradural abscess in 49 cases, and lateral sinus thrombosis in 39 cases. Intracranial complications are frequently seen in this group of patients with neglected otitis media. The complications occurred frequently in children and young adults (74%) with an overall mortality rate of 14%. Meningitis was the most common complication (37%); brain abscess had the highest mortality rate (36%). The overall mortality rate from intracranial complications was reduced in comparison with previous reported series. This is attributed to antibiotic treatment, the use of CT scan in excluding other intracranial complications, and close cooperation between the otologist and neurosurgeon.
