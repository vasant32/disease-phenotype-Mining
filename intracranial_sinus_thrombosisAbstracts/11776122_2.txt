OBJECTIVE: To describe the etiologies, clinical features and diagnosis of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. METHODS: We reviewed the records of 23 patients admitted with a documented diagnosis of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis from 1991 through 1999 in the Beijing Tiantan Hospital. RESULTS: Infection was the major condition associated with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Pseudotumor cerebri syndrome was the most common manifestation, while hemiplegia, seizure and unconsciousness may occur alone or in association. The diagnostic sensitivity of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital subtract angiography (DSA) were 59%, 86% and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity of MRI with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) reached 96%. CONCLUSION: As the clinical findings were found to be nonspecific, CT combined with DSA, or MRI with MRA turns out to be valuable for the early diagnosis of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.
