Oral contraceptives have been implicated in the pathogenesis of dural venous thrombosis. No similar association has been confirmed between postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy and cerebral venous thrombosis, although one previous report in the literature has identified such a case. We present a further case of thrombosis of the straight sinus in a patient on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and suggest that dural sinus thrombosis is a rare, but dangerous complication of HRT.
