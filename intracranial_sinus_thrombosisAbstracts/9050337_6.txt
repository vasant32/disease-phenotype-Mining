A 30-year-old woman is described with both a cerebral venous thrombosis and a deep vein thrombosis of her leg in association with an exacerbation of her ulcerative colitis. Laboratory investigations revealed a transient functional APC resistance, without Factor V mutation, and a mild hyperhomocysteinaemia. After colectomy the APC ratio was normal. These findings may form a partial explanation of the thrombophilia seen in some patients with active ulcerative colitis.
