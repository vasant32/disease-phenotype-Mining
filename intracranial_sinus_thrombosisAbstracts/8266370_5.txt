BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is rare and can be promoted by various conditions. We report the case of cerebral venous thrombosis in a patient using androgens. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 31-year-old man using androgens for bodybuilding was admitted for headache and vomiting. He had cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, but extensive examinations did not reveal any known cause. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that androgens may promote cerebral venous thrombosis. The mechanisms of venous thrombosis related to androgens may be platelet activation or an increase in coagulation factors. Because androgen use may be frequent and hidden in athletes, it may be an underestimated cause of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in the young.
