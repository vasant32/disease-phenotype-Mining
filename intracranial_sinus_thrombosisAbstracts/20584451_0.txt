Summary: Transvenous embolization is effective in the treatment of an intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF). Retrograde venous access to the fistula may be limited by associated sinus thrombosis, as in the two cases here reported. Unusual curative access routes were performed: direct superior ophthalmic vein puncture and through a small craniectomy, packing the sinus with detachable coils. When traditional routes proved impossible, unusual access routes must be devised.
