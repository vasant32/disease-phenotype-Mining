Venous hypertension in lateral sinuses resulting from dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) and venous sinus thrombosis (VST) can manifest with severe neurological deficits, such as infarction or intracerebral hemorrhage. It has been proved that venous hypertension plays a significant role in the evolution and progression of DAVF and VST. The definite treatment in complicated conditions such as multiple DAVFs or multiple sinus occlusions is still unknown. Traditional transarterial embolization, transvenous embolization or radiosurgery alone has limited effects on these conditions. We reported one case with venous hypertension presenting with severe neurological symptoms. The case had quick clinical recovery after correction of venous hypertension by endovascular angioplasty and stent placement in occluded lateral sinuses. Accordingly, we propose this method can be an ideal treatment option either in single or staged therapy of venous hypertension related to DAVFs and VST.
