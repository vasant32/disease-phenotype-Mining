CASE REPORT: The case of a small right occipital extradural hematoma in a 10-year-old girl is presented. The patient had bifrontal occipital headache out of proportion to the size of the hematoma, as well as diplopia. MR venography revealed compression and occlusion of the dominant right transverse sinus resulting in a pseudotumor cerebri syndrome. DISCUSSION: The relationship between venous sinus obstruction and the pseudotumor syndrome is discussed. Clinicians should be aware of the possible effects of an extra-axial collection on the cerebral venous sinuses.
