Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in older individuals is most often due to aneurysmal rupture. Other vascular lesions are known to rarely cause SAH. In this article, we report a case of chronic dural sinus thrombosis with recurrent SAH, most probably due to raised venous pressure in draining venous tributaries. No aneurysm was detected on magnetic resonance angiography or on digital subtraction angiography. The patient improved with conservative management. The case report emphasizes inclusion of magnetic resonance venography in the diagnostic workup of SAH, particularly in those cases in which aneurysm is not detected.
