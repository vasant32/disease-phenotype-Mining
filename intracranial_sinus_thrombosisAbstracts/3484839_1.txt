The clinical applications for conventional radionuclide brain imaging have declined considerably since the introduction of newer imaging modalities (computerized cranial tomography [CCT], nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR]). Currently, conventional brain imaging primarily serves as a complementary test when CCT is negative or equivocal and strong clinical suspicion remains. Selected areas in which radionuclide imaging may be the preferred modality include evaluation of cerebral perfusion in assessment of brain death, detection of early viral encephalitis, evaluation of major venous sinus patency, external marking for localization of intracranial tumor, and in selected cases of suspected subdural hematoma, brain tumor, and cerebrovascular disease. The concept of conventional radionuclide brain imaging will likely undergo considerable change in the near future as newer radiopharmaceuticals are introduced and wider application is made of single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.
