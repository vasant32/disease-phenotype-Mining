We report a 39 years old female presenting with headache, progressive clouding of sensorium and long pathway deficit signs. Brain CAT scan showed a process involving basal ganglia, thalami and Herophilus press. A thrombosis of this vessel was suspected. The first magnetic resonance imaging was informed as a diffuse inflammatory process compatible with an encephalitis. The patient aggravated and a second magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a partial thrombosis of sinus rectus, Galenus vein, Herophilus press and both internal cerebral veins. Intravenous heparin was started with a progressive recovery of the patient. Two months later she had an almost complete recovery with a persistent mild right brachial paresis and a memory deficit for recent events.
