An 84-year-old Japanese woman had cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) due to abdominal wall abscess. The diagnosis was delayed because abdominal wall abscess is an unfamiliar cause of CST, but a definite diagnosis was reached with the use of magnetic resonance imaging. We started intravenous antibiotic therapy against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms and the patient responded well, although the diagnosis was delayed.
