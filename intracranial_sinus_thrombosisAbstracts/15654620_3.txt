Brain vascular malformations are dynamic disorders. Although mostly considered to be of congenital origin, the improvement of clinical imaging and vasculogenesis knowledge has shown that they might also result from a biological dysfunction of the remodeling process after birth. Venous occlusive disease and ishemia may represent powerful revealing triggers and support the capillary venous origin of some vascular malformations. We report a unique case of the development of multiple de novo vascular malformations (transverse sinus dural fistula and posterior fossa cavernomas) following acoustic neuroma surgery.
