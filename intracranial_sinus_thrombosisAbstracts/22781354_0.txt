 OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship of venous sinus stenosis and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and to discuss the efficacy and strategy of endovascular treatment. METHODS: Balloon angioplasty and stent placement were performed in 24 IIH cases by lateral sinus stenosis. Mechanical thrombus maceration was performed before stent placing in 5 cases with suspected chronic dural sinus thrombosis. The clinical data of clinical presentations, intracranial pressure, pressure of lateral sinus, pressure gradient between distal and proximal lateral sinus stenosis, methods of treatment and therapeutic outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Intracranial pressure dropped from (314 ± 56) mm H2O of pre-operation to (197 ± 31) mm H2O of post-operation. The post-treatment pressure gradient was obviously high ((159 ± 11) mm H2O) and a reduction was found ((95 ± 11) mm H2O). Headache in 16 cases, vision in 13 and papilledema in 10 were resolved or improved. There was no other permanent procedure-related morbidity. The patients were followed up for 2 - 19 months. And no in-stent restenosis occurred. CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment is effective for IIH by venous sinus stenosis.
