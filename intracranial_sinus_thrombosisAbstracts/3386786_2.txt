A case of multiple spontaneous intracerebral hematomas is presented. A 67-year-old man with 7 years history of hypertension had sudden clumsiness in his right hand and an hour later dysarthria appeared. A CT scan taken 3 hours after the onset revealed two well demarcated high density areas in the left putamen and in the parietal subcortex. A diagnosis of multiple intracerebral hematomas was made. On neurological examination he was midly stuporous (13 points of Glasgow Coma Scale). Dysarthria, right hemiparesis and right extensor plantar response were seen. CT scan of 6 hours later disclosed the same findings as the previous study. He recovered well and neurologically free in a few days. On the following CT scans both hematomas were isodense 2 weeks later, and ring-like enhancement effect was noted. CT scan showed normal appearance 7 weeks later. On MRI using 0.5 T unit t-1 and t-2 weighted spin echo images of these hematomas also showed the similar chronological changes. The history, these CT and MRI studies suggest that two hematomas of this case occurred almost simultaneously in one cerebral hemisphere. No causative factors such as blood dyscrasias, AVM, angioma, septicemia, malignancies or sinus thrombosis was identified. We consider that a hypertensive intracerebral hematoma of the putamen was followed by the parietal intracerebral hematoma within a few hours, although amyloid angiopathy was not completely excluded because no cerebral biopsy of the lesion was performed.
