A 45-year-old woman presented with a non-dominant transverse-sigmoid sinus dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF) associated with convexity meningioma on the same side. The dural AVF disappeared spontaneously after surgical removal of the meningioma, even though there was no manipulation of the dural AVF. Dural AVFs are usually acquired lesions, and may develop after trauma, surgery, and dural sinus thrombosis. Dural AVFs of the acquired origins are rarely associated with brain tumor. Dural AVFs associated with a tumor may develop even in the absence of sinus occlusion.
