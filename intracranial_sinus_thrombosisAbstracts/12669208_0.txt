Sinus thrombosis is an acute life-threatening disease. While cavernous sinus thrombosis secondary to facial infections is described in the literature, it is uncommon. The key clinical characteristics are a facial infection, headache, chemosis and edema of the eyelid. The main differential diagnostic consideration is meningoencephalitis. Early diagnosis by angiography, magnetic resonance imaging and examination of CSF is important as treatment should be initiated as soon as possible in order to decrease morbidity and mortality. The mainstays of therapy are heparinization and appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy.
