Neonatal sinus thrombosis is a rare occurrence in sick neonates. Because of its nonspecific manifestations, the incidence is underestimated. This disease may not be demonstrated by conventional color Doppler and is diagnosed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The authors report a neonate with neonatal sinus thrombosis diagnosed by power Doppler and suggest that the technique may be used as a less expensive and more available screening and follow-up method in high-risk neonates.
