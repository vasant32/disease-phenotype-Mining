Cerebral (or dural) venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a condition distinct from other cerebrovascular disease, which presents its own particular diagnostic difficulties and treatment controversies. The clinical presentation is variable and may mimic a wide range of other neurological disorders that include subarachnoid haemorrhage, encephalitis, eclampsia, idiopathic intracranial hypertension and arterial stroke.
