This article presents a 9-year-old boy with acute lymphocytic leukemia who developed ocular complications after beginning treatment with L-asparaginase. Ocular motor examination revealed esotropia with a right abduction deficit, consistent with a sixth nerve palsy, and funduscopy revealed bilateral optic disc edema. Thrombosis of the right sigmoid sinus was noted on magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance venography. Symptoms gradually resolved after discontinuing L-asparaginase and treatment with heparin.
