Thrombosis of the sigmoid sinus is a relatively uncommon illness. It may present in a septic or bland form, and the latter is more or less asymptomatic. Angiography, computerised tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are all at our disposal for diagnosis of both types of thrombosis, and proper diagnosis of the specific form of sinus thrombosis will determine the required therapy. Between 1985 and 1990 six patients with sigmoid sinus thrombosis were treated at the Departments of ENT, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz and Albert Ludwig University, Freiburg, Germany, on an in-patient basis. By means of these cases we present our experience with this uncommon condition.
