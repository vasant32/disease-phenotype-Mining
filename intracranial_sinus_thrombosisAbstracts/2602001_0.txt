A case of calcified cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in an infant is described, with autopsy correlation. Calcification of sinus thrombosis is rare. A triangular calcific density was demonstrated in the superior sagittal sinus, with extension of linear calcification laterally into the transverse sinuses. Following intravenous contrast administration there was intense enhancement of the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses around the calcified thrombus. The cerebral hemispheres showed generalised atrophy. Autopsy confirmed a calcified venous sinus thrombus. Triangular calcium density within the sagittal sinus or linear calcification within the transverse sinuses would appear to be characteristic of calcified cerebral sinus thrombus.
