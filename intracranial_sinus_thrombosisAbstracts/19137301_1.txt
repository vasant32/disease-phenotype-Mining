To determine technical success and acute complication rates after endovascular coil packing of the cavernous sinus. Nineteen patients presented with either direct (13) or dural (6) arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and were treated by means of coil embolization of the cavernous sinus. The aim of treatment was complete obliteration of the fistula. In a retrospective study, the degree of obliteration, regression of symptoms as well as complication rates were evaluated. Initial complete obliteration was achieved in 12 patients, subtotal occlusion of the sinus in 6 and incomplete packing with major residual fistula in 1 of the patients. Retreatment was successfully performed in two patients with early recurrence of AVF. Follow-up showed complete occlusion rates in 16 and subtotal obliteration in 3 patients. Chemosis and exophthalmus regressed rapidly in all affected patients. Persistence of cranial nerve deficits was observed in 11 cases. Postinterventional thrombosis of the ophthalmic vein was the only major acute complication (n = 2). Coil embolization of the cavernous sinus in cases with AVF is a complex procedure that is technically feasible and safe in the majority of cases. Adequate anticoagulation is recommended to avoid thrombembolic complications. Long-term outcome has to be determined by further studies.
