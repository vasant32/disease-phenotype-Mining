We describe a 17-year-old Caucasian adolescent with ulcerative colitis who presented with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Laboratory investigation revealed low protein S levels. With successful management the patient remained without neurologic sequalae. Although there may be an association between ulcerative colitis and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, the exact pathophysiologic mechanism remains unknown.
