Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a leukoproliferative disorder that is characterized by sustained overproduction of eosinophils and a trend towards damage to specific organs, usually the cardiovascular system. We report the case of a 76-year-old woman who was affected by idiopathic HES, which had an unusual and rapidly fatal course. Sinus thrombosis in the transverse and sigmoid sinuses was evident on cranial CT and CT angiography. In our review of the English-language literature we were unable to find any previously published direct images of sinus thrombosis in idiopathic HES.
