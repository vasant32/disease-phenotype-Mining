A 20 year old woman was admitted to our Department 15 days after the onset of typhoid fever treated with chloramphenicol. The patient showed intracranial hypertension with generalized seizures, slight right hemiparesis and a left VI cranial nerve deficit with diplopia. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed occlusion of the superior longitudinal, right transverse, right sigmoid sinus combined with a single hemorrhagic infarct in the left occipito-parietal area. Serum tests were positive for Salmonella Paratyphi A and B. The results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination were normal and blood cultures were negative. Clinical data, laboratory and MRI examinations indicate that the neurological signs are the result of aseptic cerebral sinus thrombosis; the physiopathologic mechanisms of the case are discussed.
