In this study, we aimed to investigate the value of mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW) and platelet count in cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) patients and in control subjects. Fifty-three patients with evidence of CVST and thirty-five controls with similar baseline characteristics were included in the study. CVST patients were further divided into two subgroups based on the presence or absence of parenchymal lesions in cranial MRI. Our analyses revealed a significant difference in MPV and PDW values between CVST patients with lesions and controls (P < 0.05). MPV and PDW values were significantly increased in CVST patients with brain parenchmal lesions, suggesting that MPV and PDW values can be used to predict the severity of CVST.
