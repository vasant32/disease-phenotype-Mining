Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. There is a well-known risk of thrombosis in patients with IBD with an overall incidence of 1.3-7.5%. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) has been reported as an uncommon complication of IBD. It is suspected to be a consequence of genetic predisposition and the hypercoagulable state occurring during periods of increased activity. There are a few cases of Crohn`s disease in the literature associated with CVST. Here, we describe a patient of Crohn`s disease with thrombosis of the internal cerebral vein and sagittal sinus thrombosis in the intensive care unit of King Faisal Hospital, Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
