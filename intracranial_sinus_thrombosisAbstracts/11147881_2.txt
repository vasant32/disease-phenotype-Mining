This case involved a 26-month-old boy who had recurrent hemorrhagic venous infarction caused by venous sinus occlusion. Distension and enlargement of the cavum septi pellucidi (CSP) and cavum vergae (CV), along with hydrocephalus, was detected during the course of the disease and was observed to regress together with resolution of the venous occlusion. Venous hypertension caused by sinus occlusion was thought to be responsible for the disturbed resorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the CSP and CV in this patient. This case is unique because it is the first one to support the hypothesis of resorption of CSF in the cava by a pressure gradient involving the septal capillaries and veins.
