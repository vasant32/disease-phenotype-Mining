BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In this small series, local intrasinus catheter-directed heparin infusion with or without balloon thrombectomy was safe in the treatment of dural venous sinus thrombosis (DVST). Although systemic anticoagulation (SAC) is the treatment of choice, there is a lack of consensus regarding the best treatment should SAC fail or be contraindicated. We present our institutional experience with 16 patients in whom failure of, or contraindication to, SAC occurred and who subsequently underwent intrasinus catheter-directed heparin infusion with or without balloon thrombectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 16 patients ranging in age from 14 days to 77 years who had intrasinus catheter-directed heparin infusion was undertaken with 9 male and 7 female patients identified. Of these 16 patients, 4 (25%) had a contraindication to SAC and SAC failed in 12 (75%). Technically successful intrasinus infusion catheter placement was achieved in all 16 patients (100%). Mean duration of infusion was 3.3 days (range, 1-6 days). Adjunctive balloon thrombectomy was performed in 9 (56.3%) of 16 patients. No procedure-related mortality occurred. RESULTS: Partial and complete sinus recanalization occurred in 10 (62.5%) of 16 patients and 1 (6.3%) of 16 patients, respectively. There were 3 deaths (18.8%) attributed to disease progression. At most recent clinical follow-up (mean, 9.3 months), 11 (84.6%) of 13 surviving patients were independent, with a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 1 or less. CONCLUSIONS: Local intrasinus catheter-directed heparin infusion with or without adjunctive balloon thrombectomy seems to be a safe and effective treatment of DVST in patients in whom SAC failed or in whom there was a contraindication to SAC. In addition, the risk for symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage may be significantly lower than intrasinus infusion of thrombolytics.
