We report a rare case of intravascular lymphomatosis with massive tumor in the superior sagittal sinus (SSS), which caused sinus thrombosis. A 63-year-old man was incidentally found to have an enhancing mass in the superior sagittal sinus on MRI. The tumor manifested spontaneous regression during with 4 month's follow-up. Five months after the initial MR examination, T2-weighted MR images revealed a area of hyperintensity in the right occipital lobe. The area showed hypointensity on diffusion-weighted image and showed hyperintensity on ADC mapping, findings that are compatible with vasogenic edema.
