Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis is an uncommon clinical syndrome with a high morbidity and mortality. The commonest bacterial pathogen is Staphylococcus aureus. We describe the study of a patient with cavernous sinus thrombosis and meningitis caused by community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) infection. The isolate was genotyped as the ST93 (Queensland) clone of CA-MRSA and carried the Panton-Valentine leucocidin genes. Cure was obtained following prolonged antimicrobial therapy with vancomycin, rifampicin, cotrimoxazole and linezolid. Given the high morbidity and mortality of cavernous sinus thrombosis and the worldwide recent emergence of CA-MRSA, clinicians treating patients with this infection should consider early empirical coverage for CA-MRSA with an antimicrobial agent, such as vancomycin or linezolid, particularly in the presence of suspected facial staphylococcal skin infections. If vancomycin is used, we emphasize that high doses may be required to achieve even low levels in the cerebrospinal fluid.
