OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to compare the various magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences when they are used to visualize and evaluate cerebral venous thrombosis. METHODS: Eleven patients with cerebral venous thrombosis were retrospectively analyzed using computed tomography, MRI, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and conventional angiography. The MR sequence included T1-weighted spin echo (SE) imaging, obtained before and after administration of contrast medium, T2-weighted turbo spin echo (TSE), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), T2*-weighted conventional gradient-echo (GRE), as well as three-dimensional (3D) venous time-of-flight MRA and conventional angiography. RESULTS: In all of our patients, the venous sinus thromboses were most successfully detected during the T2*-weighted GRE sequence. The thrombosis was well visualized with the T1-weighted SE sequence in three of four patients in whom it was in the subacute stage. The T2*-weighted GRE sequence was superior to the T2-weighted TSE, T1-weighted SE, and FLAIR sequences in all patients. Enhanced 3D MR venography showed the thrombosed segment of the venous sinus and well correlated with the conventional angiographic findings. CONCLUSIONS: The T2*-weighted conventional GRE sequences may be the best method for detecting of cerebral venous thrombosis. Therefore, it would seem to be beneficial to integrate a T2*-weighted conventional GRE sequence into the MR protocol to diagnose cerebral venous thrombosis.
