A child with an extensive dural arteriovenous malformation (AVM) of the sigmoid sinus and bilateral occlusion of the transverse sinus is reported. His intracranial venous flow had become rerouted through the right cavernous sinus and then into the right ophthalmic veins. The AVM was associated with severe hydrocephalus and a progressive devastating neurological deficit. The hemodynamic and intracranial pressure changes as well as the mechanism of sinus thrombosis are discussed. The role of aggressive surgical treatment is emphasized.
