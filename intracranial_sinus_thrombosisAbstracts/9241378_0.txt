The authors report two cases of lateral sinus thrombosis (LST) which were recently observed after more than a 20-year absence of such pathology at their Institutions. After reviewing the epidemiologic data, the clinical observations are described in detail. Changes in symptomatology mainly due to the improper use of antibiotics are then discussed as well as the diagnostic improvement offered by modern imaging techniques. Problems still under debate concern the therapeutic strategy: internal jugular vein ligation or anticoagulation therapy versus aminoglycoside administration for patients refractory to the conventional antibiotic therapy. The necessity of close cooperation between general practitioner, pediatrician and otolaryngologist is stressed.
