INTRODUCTION: The clinical picture of lateral sinus thrombosis (LST) has changed with the advent of antibiotics, as have the utility of various diagnostic tests. LST may appear in children as a complication of acute otitis media, but nowadays it is more frequently encountered in adults with long-standing chronic ear disease. METHOD: A retrospective study of all the pediatric patients with LST between 1982 and 1997. RESULTS: Thirteen cases of LST were diagnosed and treated by our department. In six cases, LST was due to acute otitis media and in the remaining cases it was due to chronic otitis media. Headache, fever, aural discharge and mastoid tenderness were the most frequent findings in these patients and four patients were initially diagnosed with meningitis. In the majority of the patients, LST was accompanied with other intracranial complications, such as perisinus abscess, brain abscess and meningitis. One patient with multiple brain abscesses, unresponsive to several drainage procedures, died. The other patients recovered and have since been followed-up as out-patients. CONCLUSION: LST may be difficult to diagnose due to previous antibiotic treatment and to the overlap of clinical findings with other entities such as meningitis. Despite the value of modern imaging techniques in the investigation of the disease, a high index of suspicion based on the clinical picture is warranted. Our results are consistent with those of other recent studies, who found that mortality of LST has dropped below 10%.
