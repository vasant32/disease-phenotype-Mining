This study reports the sonographic and computed tomography (CT) findings in seven infants and neonates with intracranial calcifications and a spectrum of underlying disorders, including toxoplasmosis, cytomegalic inclusion disease, transverse/straight sinus thrombosis, and probable anoxia. Neurotropic infectious disease usually produced clumped or subependymal calcifications accompanied by sometimes bizarre ventricular configurations and prominent periventricular cystic encephalomalacia. Sonography failed to identify prospectively intracranial calcifications in two of the three patients without infection, although calcifications were visible in retrospect. Overall, CT provided optimum visualization of intracranial calcifications.
