Two patients presented with hypoglossal neurinoma extending both intra- and extracranially. A 63-year-old male presented with right trigeminal neuralgia and hypoglossal nerve paresis. The intracranial part of the tumor was removed totally via a suboccipital craniectomy. Over-coagulation of the venous collaterals, particularly the emissary veins, resulted in dural venous sinus thrombosis and cerebellar infarction. Unfortunately this patient died. A 48-year-old male presented with pareses of the VII, IX, X, XI, and XII cranial nerves and cerebellar sign. The tumor extended both extra- and intracranially, and was completely removed by opening the hypoglossal canal and the jugular foramen without over-coagulation of the venous collaterals. Preservation of the venous collaterals is very important for the prevention of postoperative venous complications.
