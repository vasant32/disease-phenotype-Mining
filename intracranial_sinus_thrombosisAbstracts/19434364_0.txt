BACKGROUND: We report a rare case of small cell carcinoma originating from the right cavernous sinus in a 55-year-old male. The patient had sudden onset of right abducens palsy following right oculomotor palsy. METHODS: Post-contrast T1-weighted MRI revealed a mass lesion of 3-cm maximum size occupying the right cavernous sinus and extending to the right middle cranial fossa. After biopsy via the frontozygomatic approach, one radiosurgery treatment was followed by four cycles of chemotherapy (cisplatin together with VP-16 therapy), after which the lesion diminished dramatically in size. RESULTS: Complete remission has currently been achieved. The patient recovered from the extraocular muscle paresis and returned to his previous work. Although it is considered possible that small cell carcinoma can occur wherever neuroendocrine cells exist, a lesion originating in the cranium is extremely rare. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of small cell carcinoma of intracranial origin.
