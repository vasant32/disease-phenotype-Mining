The authors report a 39-year-old woman who presented with intermittent, excruciating nuchal and occipital headache. Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography scans showed bilateral subdural haematomas with veno-occlusive disease of the superficial and deep venous systems. There were bridging collaterals with scalp veins, bleeds from which could explain the subdural haematoma. There was acute on chronic veno-occlusive disease with an acute rise in intracranial pressure and a bleed from the vein of Galen.
