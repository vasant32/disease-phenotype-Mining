We present an unusual combination of vascular complications of cavernous sinus thrombosis in a 7-year-old girl. MRI and MR angiography showed occlusion of the intracranial portion of the left internal carotid artery and a contralateral giant cavernous carotid aneurysm. This combination of vascular findings may influence the management in such cases.
