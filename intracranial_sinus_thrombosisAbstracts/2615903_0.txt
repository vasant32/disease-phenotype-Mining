The overall incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) among neurosurgical in-patients, whose ages ranged from 23 to 80, was 0.7%. Our report here is based on five cases of patients with PE. Four of these five patients were over 50 years of age. They had been admitted because of such reasons as brain tumor, spinal cord injury, intracerebral hematoma, and venous sinus thrombosis. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was seen in four but none were diagnosed before they had developed PE. Decreased level of consciousness and prolonged bed rest appeared to be common risk factors for PE. Mean duration between admission and onset of PE was 31 days. Although non-specific, tachycardia, tachypnea and hypoxemia were the most common signs and symptoms. As a definitive diagnostic procedure, pulmonary angiography was performed in most of cases. One patient required surgical embolectomy and others were treated with anticoagulation or fibrinolytic agents. In order to prevent recurrent thromboembolic phenomena, ligation of the inferior vena cava was a useful mode of treatment when anticoagulation was not indicated. And this approach seemed to be valid in most neurosurgical patients. We conclude that PE and DVT were not uncommon complications among Japanese neurosurgical patients and they can be treated successfully in collaboration with a cardiovascular surgeon if the diagnosis can be made correctly.
