A case of superior sagittal sinus thrombosis associated with Evans' syndrome of immune haemolytic anaemia is reported. The neurological symptoms and signs were headaches, right quadrant hemianopia, dyslexia without agraphia, motor aphasia, numbness in and weakness of the right upper extremity, papilloedema and coma. The cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, involving cerebral veins, superior sagittal sinus and straight sinus, was diagnosed by cerebral angiography. It is noteworthy that the superior sagittal sinus thrombosis occurred during a haematological recovery period, with rapid responses to treatment with 6-mercaptopurine and high doses of adrenocorticosteroids. Following a reduction in the doses of these drugs, the symptoms and signs related to the superior sagittal sinus thrombosis gradually subsided, and the haematological pictures remained in remission.
