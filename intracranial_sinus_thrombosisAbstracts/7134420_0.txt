There is no reliable CT diagnosis in all cases of cerebral sinovenous thrombosis. The hyperdense sinus structures may indicate an acute thrombotic occlusion, but we know other reasons of this finding. Only the so-called empty triangle sing is pathognomonic, while the unilateral or bilateral hemorrhages, circumscript or diffuse edema with small ventricles and the tentorial hypervascularity are not specific of sinovenous occlusion. We present our findings in 15 cases of sinovenous thrombosis and conclude, that the combination of clinical course and CT-finding with specific or some non-specific signs will give the correct diagnosis of sinus thrombosis with or without angiography.
