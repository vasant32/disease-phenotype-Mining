Cutaneous scalp hemangiomas may herald the presence of occult intracranial hemangiomas. A previously healthy 4-month-old girl presented with a bleeding scalp hemangioma, a bulging fontanel, and anemia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed hydrocephalus along with multiple intracranial hemangiomas. These lesions compressed the jugular foramina, resulting in venous sinus thrombosis involving the right transverse sinus, the left sigmoid sinus, and the torcular herophili. The patient had no family history of phakomatoses or other genetic abnormalities. A thrombophilia work-up result was unremarkable. The patient was treated with prednisolone (10 mg twice daily) and low molecular weight heparin (1 mg/kg/dose) twice daily. This treatment decreased the size of her cutaneous and intracranial hemangiomas and led to the resolution of her venous sinus thromboses and hydrocephalus. Innocuous scalp hemangioma in an infant may herald more concerning intracranial pathology, which can be treated effectively if diagnosed with appropriate imaging studies.
