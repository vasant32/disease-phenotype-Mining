INTRODUCTION: Neurological manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus are frequent and polymorphic. In 40% of cases, lupus can be revealed by neurological symptoms. Cerebral nervous system complications predominate and can be a negative factor for prognosis. Peripheral features are rare and various and can compromise functional prognosis, sometimes with fatal outcome. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 30-year-old woman who presented a cerebral venous thrombosis of the superior longitudinal sinus. Outcome was favorable with antibiotics and anticoagulants. Four months later, she developed an acute polyradiculoneuritis associated with an inflammatory syndrome and positive tests for antinuclear antibody and antinuclear anti-DNA. The diagnosis of neurolupus was retained on the basis of four criteria of the American college of Rheumatology. The patient was given steroid therapy associated with a course of intravenous immunoglobulin. She has fully recovered her deficit. CONCLUSION: Cerebral venous thrombosis and acute polyradiculon√©vrites are rare events in systemic lupus erythematosus. Early diagnosis and management are crucial.
