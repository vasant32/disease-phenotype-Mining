An alcoholic man with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus had right conjunctivitis, facial numbness, and periorbital edema progressing to bilateral visual loss, and left ptosis in association with a large necrotic palatal ulcer due to zygomycosis. The infection progressed to bilateral retinal vein engorgement; left-sided ophthalmoplegia, fixed dilated pupil, and absent corneal reflex; and right-sided ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and facial nerve paralysis. Work-up revealed disease of both ethmoid sinuses and the right maxillary sinus, with bilateral thromboses of the cavernous sinuses. An aggressive combined therapeutic attack (three Caldwell-Luc procedures, exploration of orbit walls, control of diabetes, systemic and local amphotericin therapy) led to survival with a three-year follow-up thus far.
