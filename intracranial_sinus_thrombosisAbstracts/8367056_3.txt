A 65-year-old woman was evaluated for vertigo. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging as well as angiography revealed the coexistence of a tumor at the junction of the right transverse-sigmoid sinuses, a dural arteriovenous malformation (AVM) of the right transverse sinus, and a right sigmoid sinus thrombosis. After transarterial embolization via the external carotid artery, the tumor was totally removed and the right transverse sinus was embolized with platinum coils and Surgicel. Postoperatively, the dural AVM was completely occluded, and the histological examination of the tumor showed it to be a transitional type of meningioma. It would be suggested that the right transverse-sigmoid sinuses are involved by the meningioma to develop the sigmoid sinus thrombosis and the dural AVM of the transverse sinus, supporting an acquired origin of the dural AVM.
