The case of a woman on day four post partum with sensorimotor deficit of the right side and CT evidence of a left temporofrontal hemorrhagic lesion, is presented. Attending physicians requested cerebral angiography. To better evaluate the clinical justification of requested imaging procedure the patient medical history and performed CT examination were carefully revised. According to this analysis and based on a clinicoradiological methodology, the request of a cerebral angiography was considered appropriate. The examination showed several radiological signs but a definitive diagnosis could not be established. Second choice imaging procedures were analyzed and MRI completed with MR-angiography was performed. It allowed to document transverse and sigmoid sinus thrombosis. Therefore, in the diagnosis of venous sinus thrombosis, MRI combined with MR-angiography was shown to be a method of first choice while angiography plays a major role in therapy for intravascular thrombolysis.
