 OBJECTIVE: To describe the recovery outcomes in pediatric patients with otogenic lateral sinus and internal jugular vein thrombosis. METHODS: An inpatient database from a tertiary care pediatric hospital was queried from 1999 to 2010 for the diagnosis code [325] thrombosis of intracranial venous sinus. Demographics, extent of thrombosis, surgical intervention, use of anticoagulation, and the presence of recanalization on follow-up imaging was collected. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (10 male, 5 female) were identified with otogenic lateral sinus thrombosis. Eleven patients (73.3%) had evidence of thrombus in the transverse sinus, while 10 patients (66.7%) had thrombus in the internal jugular vein, and one patient (6.7%) had thrombus in the cavernous sinus. Five patients (33%) had otitic hydrocephalus. Twelve patients (80%) underwent operative manipulation of the lateral sinus including: three decompressions 20%, three needle aspirations 20%, and six venotomies with evacuation of clot or pus 40%. Twelve patients were anticoagulated with low molecular weight heparin, and three patients were not anticoagulated. Ten of fourteen patients (71.4%) who underwent follow-up magnetic resonance venography had evidence of partial (57.1%) or complete (14.3%) recanalization of the lateral sinus. All five patients with otitic hydrocephalus recovered as determined by a normal fundoscopic exam and recovery of abducens paresis. CONCLUSION: Recanalization of the lateral intracranial venous sinus occurred in the majority of the patients in this series. The role of operative intervention and/or anticoagulation remains unclear.
