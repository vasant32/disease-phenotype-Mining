A young woman with factor V Leiden thrombophilia presented with headache due to thrombosis of the right transverse sinus (TS) and superior sagittal sinus. Despite appropriate anticoagulation, she experienced worsening headache, progressive neurologic deficits and spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage. Endovascular therapy was therefore undertaken. A 6 mm Solitaire FR device was deployed in the TS and withdrawn in a stepwise fashion, resulting in complete recanalization of the sinus. Her headache improved and her neurologic deficits resolved. Endovascular therapy for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is currently recommended only for those patients with deterioration despite appropriate anticoagulation. The thrombus burden is usually high in this subset of patients, and recanalization can be challenging with currently available endovascular techniques. This is the first report of cerebral venous sinus thrombectomy with the Solitaire FR device, which may offer another option for those patients requiring endovascular treatment.
