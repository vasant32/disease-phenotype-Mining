A 45-year-old patient presented with bilateral orbital abscesses. He was found to have Lemierre syndrome, a condition involving septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein. The patient developed severe proptosis, sepsis, and cavernous sinus thrombosis. Despite aggressive antibiotic and anticoagulation therapy, visual loss was rapid, and the patient ultimately died. Lemierre syndrome, previously thought to be rare, is now becoming more commonly reported. Its prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential for patient survival.
