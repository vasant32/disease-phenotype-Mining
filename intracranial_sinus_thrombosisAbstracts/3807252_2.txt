A case study of 2 patients with venous congestion of the orbit due to different etiologies is presented. Both the children demonstrated orbital pain, proptosis, chemosis and conjunctival injection. In one case early diagnosis left to complete recovery by conservative treatment in a patient with a pyogenic cavernous sinus thrombosis. In the other case a traumatic carotid sinus cavernous fistula could be treated successfully using transvasculary navigated detachable balloons.
