The cavernous sinus is most frequently involved by septic thrombosis. The common sites of primary infection are the medial face, orbits, tonsils, soft palate, sphenoid and ethmoid sinuses. The usual clinical presentation begins with fever and periorbital edema followed by headache, ptosis and ocular muscles palsy. The diagnosis is usually made on clinical grounds. Treatment consists of eradication of the primary source of infection and the administration of antibiotics and anticoagulants. We report six cases of septic thrombosis of cavernous sinus.
