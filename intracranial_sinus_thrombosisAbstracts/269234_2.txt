The similarities between the various conditions described are remarkable. The orbital or frontal bruit and pulsating exophthalmos are common only to the carotid-cavernous fistula. A recent history of dental treatment, of facial infection with an elevated white blood cell count, and leukocytosis suggests cavernous sinus thrombosis. The superior orbital fissure syndrome and orbital apex syndrome occur most frequently in conjuction with Le Fort II and III fractures, which can involve the optic foramen and superior orbital fissure, therefore disrupting the sensory and motor innervation to the orbit and adjacent structures (Fig 4). Direct orbital trauma without evidence of fracture and with all symptoms mentioned, except infection, bruit, and pulsating exophthalmos, suggests orbital hematoma. A thorough differential diagnosis with complete data is essential for a correct diagnosis, thereby reducing morbidity by institution of the appropriate treatment. Treatments for carotid cavernous fistula have varied over the years--all aiming toward abolition of the fistula. Currently, the preferred treatment is the supraclinoid clamping of the internal carotid artery, followed by muscle embolization of the internal carotid artery distal to the bifurcation, and clamping of the internal carotid artery in the neck.
