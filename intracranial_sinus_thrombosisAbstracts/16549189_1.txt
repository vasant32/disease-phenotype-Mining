The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in patients who developed neurologic complications after liver and kidney transplantation. The results in 216 organ transplant recipients, who had brain MRI were evaluated retrospectively. We performed 187 brain MRI on kidney recipients and 29 liver recipients. Neuroradiologic findings were classified in three groups: group 1 findings were related to transplantation; group 2 findings, to chronic parenchymal disease; and group 3 to neither transplantation nor chronic parenchymal disease. In group 1, six patients (20.6%) after liver and three (1.6%) after kidney transplantation had posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome; two patients (1.1%) after renal and one (3.4%) after liver transplantation had tuberculosis granulomas; one patient (0.5%) after renal transplantation had osmotic demyelination syndrome; one patient (0.5%) had a Nocardia abcess and one (0.5%) focal cerebritis after renal transplantation. Among group 2, 38 patients (20.3%) had brain atrophy; 37 (20%), white matter changes; 3 (1.6%), sinus thrombosis; 8 (4.3%), lacunar infarct; 1 (0.5%), had renal osteodystrophy in the cranial bones; and 4 (2.2%), had intracranial hemorrhage secondary to end-stage renal disease. Brain atrophy in nine patients (31%), hyperintensity in the globus pallidus on T1-weighted MR images owing to manganese deposits in nine patients (31%), hyperintensity in basal ganglia on T2-weighted MR images owing to copper depositions in one patient (3.4%) were seen secondary to chronic liver disease. In group 3, three patients (1.6%) had intracranial lipomas; one (0.5%), mesial temporal sclerosis; and one (0.5%), an anterior cerebral artery aneurysm in renal transplant patients. Periventricular and subcortical white matter hyperintensities were observed on T2-weighted MR images in six liver transplant patients (20.7%). Neurologic complications after organ transplantation may be secondary to transplantation itself, to chronic parenchymal disease, or to neither transplantation nor chronic parenchymal disease.
