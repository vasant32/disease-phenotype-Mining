The entity of cerebrovascular diseases associated with the use of oral contraceptives is well known but quite rare in Japan in contrast to Western countries. We recently encountered a 38 years old female with cerebral venous thrombosis considered to be caused by oral contraception. This patient took oral contraceptives for 17 days following therapeutic abortion, and was transferred to our hospital because of disturbed consciousness. CT scans disclosed a right temporo-occipital subcortical hemorrhagic infarction and bilateral thalamic infarction. Cerebral angiograms showed non-filling of cortical veins in the same area. The internal cerebral vein, vein of Galen and right transverse sinus were not visualized either. The hematoma and necrotic tissue were removed to avoid farther neurological deterioration. The brain was swollen and hyperemic, and thrombosed cortical veins were clearly recognized at operation. Twelve cases, including ours, of cerebrovascular diseases associated with oral contraception were reported up to now in Japan, and only 3 of them were diagnosed objectively as venous or sinus thrombosis. The average age of these 12 cases was 34 years old and many of them experienced abortion or therapeutic abortion. There was no relationship between the dose of estrogen and the onset of cerebrovascular diseases. We believe that the onset of this pathological state is based on gynecological hypercoagulable state, and the oral contraception may play a role of a trigger. Oral contraception should be contraindicated in patients with gynecological hypercoagulable state, hypertension and/or smoking habit.
