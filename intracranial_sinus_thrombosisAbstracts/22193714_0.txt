Lateral sinus thrombosis (LST) is an uncommon, but life-threatening complication of both acute and chronic otitis media. There is some evidence that acquired or hereditary prothrombotic disorders are risk factors for LST. The aim of this work was to evaluate the role of thrombotic screening, anticoagulant therapy or prophylaxis in patients with either acute or chronic otitis media and LST. The medical records of five children hospitalized at Pediatric Hospital Bambino Ges√π of Rome because of acute or chronic otitis media complicated by mastoiditis and LST were reviewed. All children underwent laboratory workup for hypercoagulability. All the five children were found to be heterozygote for the C677T MTHFR mutation and a child presented also heterozygosity for factor V Leiden mutation. They have been successfully treated with anticoagulant therapy without sequels. Children with acute or chronic otitis media may have a prothrombotic tendency that becomes clinically evident because of the inflammatory state. Patients with a family and/or personal history of thrombosis and/or thrombophilic conditions need anticoagulant prophylaxis also in the absence of clear signs of LST. Treatment with low molecular weight is successful in patients with LST.
