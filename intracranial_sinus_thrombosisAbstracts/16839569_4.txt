Puerperal cerebral veno-sinus thrombosis (PCVT) is a common form of stroke in young women in India, which is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The frequency of PCVT in India is 10 to 12 times more compared to western population. As yet, the etiology of this condition is unclear. Our aim was to study the prevalence and the role of the common genetic polymorphisms associated with thrombophilia such as factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T, in aseptic PCVT. We investigated 86 women with PCVT and 86 age-matched women with no post-partum complications. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was used to identify their genotypes. The frequency of the three polymorphisms in cases and controls were: factor V Leiden, 2.3% versus 1.2% (OR 0.49, 95% CI=0.02-7.12, p=1.000) and MTHFR C677T, 16.3% versus 17.4% (OR 0.92, 95% CI=0.39-2.19, p=0.838). The prothrombin G20210A variant was not detected in either patients or controls. The clinical characteristics of the PCVT patients with the polymorphisms did not differ significantly from those without them. In our series of PCVT patients, the risk associated with the established thrombophilic risk factors is insignificant. Exploration of these gene polymorphisms seems to be of limited value in the investigation of PCVT in south Indian women.
