Digital intravenous cerebral angiography was performed in 13 neonates. Injections were made either centrally into the right atrium or peripherally into a distal vein. Seven infants suffered from anoxia, one infant had clinical brain death, another had focal infarcts, and two had intracranial hemorrhage. One infant had an intracranial tumor and another had a neck tumor. Venous sinus thrombosis was seen in five of the seven anoxic infants. A total absence of intracranial arterial circulation was demonstrated in the clinically brain-dead infant. Vascularity and venous involvement by neoplasm were excellently delineated by this technique.
