Objective: To report two cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with papilledema and visual loss that improved after endovascular stent placement. Materials and methods: Retrospective case series from a tertiary ophthalmic center. Results: Two cases of venous sinus occlusion treated with angioplasty and stenting are described. Both cases experienced improvement in optic disc edema and visual function following the procedures. Conclusion: Endovascular stent placement may relieve increased intracranial pressure and papilledema caused by cerebral sinus thrombosis and may prevent further visual loss.
