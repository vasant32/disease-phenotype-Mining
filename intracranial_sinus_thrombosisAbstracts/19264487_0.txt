We report on the successful treatment of acute sinus thrombosis associated with endovascular treatment of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulae (DAVF) by sinus angioplasty with stent deployment. A 76-year-old man presented with intracerebral hemorrhage, Cognard type IIa+b DAVF of the left sigmoid sinus, and type IIa DAVF of the torcular herophili. During transvenous sinus embolization, acute thrombosis of the stenotic lesion in the left transverse sinus occurred. The thrombosis caused isolated sinus and cortical venous reflux (CVR). The patient was treated by stent-supported sinus angioplasty, which led to an immediate improvement of the sinus thrombosis and associated CVR.
