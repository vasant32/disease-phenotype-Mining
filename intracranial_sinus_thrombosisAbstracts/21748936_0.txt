Although hormonal influences, inflammation, trauma, sinus thrombosis, venous hypertension, and congenital origin have been proposed as sources of dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) in cavernous and sigmoid sinuses, the etiology of these lesions remains controversial. We present a case with a cavernous sinus DAVF developed from viral meningitis which has not been previously described. A 24-year-old male was admitted to our institute because of periorbital pain, decreased vision, pulsatile tinnitus, chemosis, and exophthalmos on the right side after he had suffered viral meningitis four months before. Cerebral angiography demonstrated a cavernous sinus DAVF, which was successfully obliterated with several platinum coils using a transvenous approach. The viral meningitis most likely caused the inflammation, that may be responsible for the occurrence of the cavernous sinus DAVF. Prompt treatment for inflammation may help to prevent the development of DAVFs.
