Cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) is a rare and serious complication secondary to invasive fungal sinusitis, but rarer still in cases of allergic fungal sinusitis. Current recommendations for cavernous sinus thrombosis are controversial, especially regarding anticoagulation, secondary to the rarity of the diagnosis. Early surgical debridement and intravenous antibiotics are crucial to prevent mortality and decrease morbidity. Because thrombosis is thought to be caused by a bacterial superinfection, which follows a response to Aspergillus, antifungals may not be necessary. Despite the controversy, most physicians opt to treat with anticoagulation.
