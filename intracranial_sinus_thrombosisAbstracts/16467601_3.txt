A 65-year-old woman with poorly controlled diabetes presented bilateral miosis, bilateral abducens nerve palsy, and left hemiparesis. On MRI, cavernous sinus thrombosis, subdural empyema and hemorrhagic infarction in the frontotemporal lobe were detected. Cerebral angiogram revealed filling defect in the cavernous sinus with venous congestion but no involvement of internal carotid artery. Postmortem examination demonstrated hemorrhagic infarction in the right frontotemporal lobe as well as hemorrhagic necrosis of the pituitary gland. It should be noted that venous congestion due to cavernous sinus thrombosis may cause these complications.
