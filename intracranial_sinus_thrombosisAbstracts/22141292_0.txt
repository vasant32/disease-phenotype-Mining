A 22-year-old male had a meniscopathy operation using spinal anesthesia. After the operation, the patient reported a throbbing headache. His brain computed tomography (CT) showed subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and hyperdense dural venous sinuses suspicious for thrombosis. Filling defects were observed in the superior sagittal and right transverse sinuses on the contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images. The patient was diagnosed with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). On the tenth day of his admission, his clinical findings progressed and heparin therapy was initiated after resorption of hemorrhage was observed in a second non-contrast CT scan. The patient developed decreased consciousness the day after heparin administration. A subsequent brain CT revealed intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right anteroinferior frontal region. Heparin therapy was discontinued, and anti-edema therapy was started. The presentation of CVST with SAH is a rare condition. Furthermore, development of CVST after spinal anesthesia is very rare. In this case, CVST developed after spinal anesthesia, and its first clinical presentation was SAH. To our knowledge, this is the first case CVST presenting with SAH after spinal anesthesia.
