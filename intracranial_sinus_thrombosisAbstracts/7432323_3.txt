From 218 patients aged 15 to 72 years suffering from inflammatory infectious diseases of the central nervous system, 162 patients were treated with high doses of immunoglobulins (Ig). The therapeutic results were compared with those of the 56 patients without an additive therapy, separately for bacterial and viral infections. If we compare recoveries and deaths or survivals but defective recoveries, the chi-square test reveals that treatment with Ig at the 0.1 percent level is superior to treatment without Ig in a highly significant manner in favor of the use of Ig. Using other criteria, such as the duration of fever and the length of hospital confinement, calculations using Student's t-test also show significant results in favor of Ig. Early beginning of therapy with high doses of Ig given intravenously, or if necessary intrathecally, proved to be of great therapeutic value in lowering the number of fatalities and defective recoveries.
