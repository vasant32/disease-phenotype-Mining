Pregnancy-induced hypertensive syndromes are an important cause of cerebrovascular diseases during pregnancy. Women with pregnancy-induced hypertensive syndromes are at an increased risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. Posterior reversible encephalopathy and reversible vasoconstriction syndromes are common. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis may also occur. Preeclampsia and eclampsia reflect generalized endothelial dysfunction. Prompt diagnosis and identification of patients at risk allows for early therapeutic interventions and improved clinical outcomes.
