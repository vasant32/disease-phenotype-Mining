OBJECTIVE: To present our experience with the diagnosis and treatment of lateral sinus thrombosis (LST) secondary to otogenic disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have retrospectively reviewed all the cases of LST caused by chronic otitis media in ten years. RESULTS: In our series of five patients, four patients were successfully treated by surgery without opening the sigmoid sinus. On the other hand, one of our patients developed hydrocephalus and ataxia during preoperative antibiotic treatment. CONCLUSION: Most patients with thrombotic/nonabscessed sinuses will have successful outcomes with this approach, but careful observation is needed, given the possibility of advancing disease.
