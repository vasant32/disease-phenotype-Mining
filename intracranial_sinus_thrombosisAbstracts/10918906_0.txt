Four patients, a woman aged 41 years and 3 men aged 12, 47 and 44 years, developed high fever after returning from a farm vacation in the Ard√®che (France). They also suffered from severe headache, a painful tightness of the chest, abdominal pain or myalgia. Other symptoms were shivers, tiredness and a cough. While physical examination revealed few abnormalities, the chest X-ray in 3 patients showed an atypical pneumonia. One of these patients developed dural venous sinus thrombosis with increased intraspinal pressure. This patient also showed signs of a slight hepatitis. Serological investigation revealed that all 4 patients were suffering from acute Q fever, a zoonosis caused by the Coxiella burnetii bacterium. All 4 had been present at lambing and sheep-shearing. The patients with pneumonia were treated with antibiotics. All 4 patients recovered well. It is known that animal birth products in particular can contain large numbers of bacteria and therefore be highly infectious.
