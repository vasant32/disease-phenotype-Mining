Ischemic stroke during infancy and childhood has the potential for life-long morbidity. Information on the neurologic outcome of children who survive ischemic stroke is lacking. Children surviving ischemic stroke between January 1, 1995 and July 1, 1999 were prospectively followed. Neurologic deficit severity was based on the Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure (PSOM) developed in this study and parental response to two recovery questions. Predictor variables for poor outcome were tested. One-hundred twenty-three children with arterial ischemic stroke and 38 with sinovenous thrombosis were followed for a mean of 2.1 years (range, 0.8 to 6.6 years). The primary outcome based on PSOM assessment was: normal, 37%; mild deficit, 20%; moderate deficit, 26%; and severe deficit, 16%. The secondary outcome was full recovery in 45% of patients, based on parental response. The primary and secondary outcome measures were moderately correlated (P < .001; K = 0.5). In bivariate analysis, arterial stroke type, male gender, age of at least 28 days, presence of associated neurologic disorders, and need for rehabilitation therapy after stroke were predictors of poor outcome (P < .05). Multivariate analysis showed that only arterial ischemic stroke, associated neurologic disorders, and presence of rehabilitation therapy were independent predictors of poor outcome (P < .02). Poor outcome in children after ischemic stroke is therefore frequent and more likely in the presence of arterial stroke, rehabilitation therapy, and associated neurologic disorders, which justifies clinical trials of treatment strategies in childhood ischemic stroke.
