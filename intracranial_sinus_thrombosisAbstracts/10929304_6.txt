We report a case of intravascular lymphomatosis of the brain with 8 months' follow-up and fatal outcome. Several MRI investigations revealed variegated, rapidly changing infarct-like lesions and invasion of the walls of the superior sagittal sinus and deep veins. When disturbances of the venous outflow are detected with multifocal infarct-like lesions, intravascular lymphomatosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Brain biopsy may ensure the proper diagnosis ante mortem, but failure of biopsy is frequent, as in our case.
