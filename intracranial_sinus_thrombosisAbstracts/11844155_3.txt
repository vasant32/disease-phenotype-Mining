Invasive zygomycosis is a devastating fungal infection occurring as an opportunistic infection after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Sinusitis can lead to fungal infection in immunosuppressed patients, and cavernous sinus thrombosis, an uncommon condition in immunocompetent patients, typically follows an infection involving the medial third of the face, nose, or paranasal sinuses. Patients undergoing unrelated-donor BMT (UD-BMT) are prone to develop life-threatening infections because of poor recovery of cellular immunity. Despite adequate clinical evaluation and treatment, the prognosis of patients with invasive fungal infections is dismal, especially when intracerebral structures are affected. We describe a case of a patient who underwent an UD-BMT and developed cavernous sinus thrombosis after sinusitis due to zygomycosis. Moreover, he also had disseminated fungal (Zygomycetes and Aspergillus) and viral (cytomegalovirus and adenovirus) infections.
