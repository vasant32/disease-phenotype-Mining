Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is a rare, serious cerebrovascular disease with poor prognosis. It can be a sequel to various coagulation disturbances, head injuries or local inflammations. We report a case of a young woman with no risk factors detected, who developed a massive cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. She had progressively worsening symptoms, including left hemiplegia, aphasia, tonic-clonic seizures and unconsciousness. The diagnosis was supported by CT, MRI and angio-MRI findings. The intensive i.v. heparin and streptokinase treatment, as well as antibiotics, resulted in full remission of all patient's symptoms. The case emphasizes the necessity of early diagnosis and management of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.
