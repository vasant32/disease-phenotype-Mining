Saggital sinus occlusion was produced in cats. The intracranial volume-pressure relations were studied using the lumbar infusion tests. Right after occlusion ICP rised from 7.1 +/- 1.8 to 12.4 +/- 4.1 mmHg. The values of outflow resistance and volume-pressure response increased also and remained significantly unchanged with only slight decrease of the volume-pressure response. The morphometric study of the surface veins showed the dilatation of the veins draining to the occluded saggital sinus for about 10-20%. No signs of the blood-brain barrier disruption were observed.
