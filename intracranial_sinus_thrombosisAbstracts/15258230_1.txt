The venous drainage of the orbit is known to be via the ophthalmic and vortex veins which communicate with the cavernous sinus. We describe two patients with raised intracranial pressure presenting with periorbital bruising. In one patient dural venous sinus thrombosis was demonstrated and it is suspected that the cause of the raised intracranial pressure may have been the same in the second. We suggest that the abrupt rise of pressure in the cerebral venous system was transmitted via the cavernous sinus to the orbital venous system.
