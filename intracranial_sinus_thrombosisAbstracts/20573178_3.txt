 UNLABELLED: AIMo describe the characteristics of paediatric cerebral sinus venous thrombosis (CSVT) in Switzerland. METHOD: data on clinical features, neuroimaging, risk factors, and treatment were collected for all children in Switzerland younger than 16 years of age who had CSVT between January 2000 and December 2008. A follow-up examination and a cognitive assessment were performed (mean follow-up period 26mo). Differences between neonates and children (patients older than 28d) were assessed and predictors of outcome were determined. RESULTS: twenty-one neonates (14 males, seven females; mean age 9d, SD 8d) and 44 children (30 males, 14 females; mean age 8y 7mo, SD 4y 5mo) were reported. The incidence of paediatric CSVT in Switzerland was 0.558 per 100000 per year. In neonates, the deep venous system was more often involved and parenchymal injuries were more common. The strongest predictor of poor outcome was neonatal age (odds ratio 17.8, 95% confidence interval 0.847-372.353). Most children showed global cognitive abilities within the normal range, but impairments in single cognitive subdomains were frequent. INTERPRETATION: paediatric CSVT is rare. Its outcome is poor in neonates. Most children have good neurological outcomes, but some patients have individual neuropsychological impairments.
