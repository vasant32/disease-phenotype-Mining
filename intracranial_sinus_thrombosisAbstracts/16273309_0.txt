Superior saggital sinus thrombosis (SSST), which has a strong causal link with antiphospholipid syndrome, rarely occurs in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We describe a 34-year-old woman with SLE whose clinical problem was mild headache. Her serology indicated negative antiphospholipid, anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulants. However, marked dilatation of the entire saggital sinus with scattered thrombi was observed in enhanced-, surface- and three-dimensional reconstructed CTs (3D-CTs) without abnormal intra-axial signal in brain MRI. The enhanced-, surface- and 3D-CTs are useful to detect silent dural sinus dilatation with scattered thrombi in a patient with SLE without any symptoms of SSST.
