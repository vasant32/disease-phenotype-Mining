Orbital cellulitis as a complication of ophthalmic surgery is uncommon. We treated a patient who had orbital cellulitis and cavernous sinus thrombosis three weeks after uncomplicated cataract extraction and lens implantation. Sinus x-rays showed sphenoid sinus opacification. Computed tomographic scan confirmed the sphenoid sinus disease, and no abscess was found. The patient recovered completely after treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Most orbital cellulitis is secondary to sinus disease. The trauma of surgery and the retrobulbar block must be considered possible causative factors in this patient, but sinus disease is still the most likely cause. Intraocular inflammation did not increase during the illness although the intraocular pressure rose from 14 to 23mmHg.
