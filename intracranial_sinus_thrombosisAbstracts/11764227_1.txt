We describe the first case in which de novo production of multiple IgG antinuclear antibodies (ANA) occurred in a female neonate of an ANA negative mother. The infant presented at 4 weeks of age with hemorrhagic panencephalitis, diffuse intraparenchymal hemorrhages, and straight sinus thrombosis. She had been vaccinated against hepatitis B at birth. No other cause was found and maternal prenatal care was unremarkable. The infant's screening ANA test by ELISA was positive at 6 weeks with specificity for ssDNA, Sm, and nRNP/Sm. At 8 weeks antibodies to dsDNA and centromere were detected as well. By 8 months, she still had slightly elevated anti-dsDNA, Sm, and nRNP/Sm antibodies. The ANA test by immunofluorescence was abnormal at 8 weeks through 13 weeks with centromere and then homogeneous pattern. Based on similarities with other reported cases, we speculate that hepatitis B vaccination may have been involved in the development of antinuclear antibodies.
