A 40-year-old man developed general malaise, dizziness and progressive headache 1 week after acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis. Bizarre behaviour, confusion and adversive seizures occurred later. MRI showed haemorrhagic infarct in the bilateral basal ganglia and thalamus and abnormal signal density in the internal cerebral veins. Bilateral carotid angiography showed no filling of superior sagittal sinus and internal cerebral veins. With MRI, cerebral venous thrombosis can be suspected and diagnosed earlier than before, obviating any invasive investigation.
