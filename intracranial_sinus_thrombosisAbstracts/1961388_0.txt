The authors describe a case of cavernous sinus thrombosis in a female aged 59 years referred to hospital with suspected tumour at the base of the brain. With the present broad use of sulphamides and antibiotics the incidence of septic thrombosis of the cavernous sinus has decreased considerably. In the reported case the infectious focus giving rise to the thrombosis was in the palatine tonsils or in teeth with gangrenous changes. The thrombosis was associated with infarction of the left hemisphere. The correct diagnosis was established after CT of the head.
