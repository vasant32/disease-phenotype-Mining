BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of helical CT cerebrovascular imaging (CTCVI) in children and to make initial comparisons with MR angiography and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). METHODS: Twenty-six patients, ages 3 days to 17 years, were examined with CTCVI. Patients were scanned with 1-mm collimation and 2:1 pitch 30 seconds after the initiation of a hand injection of 2 mL/kg nonionic contrast material (320 mg/dL iodine) with a maximum dose that did not exceed 80 mL (minimum volume, 5 mL in a 2.5-kg infant). Reconstructions were done using maximum intensity projection and integral rendering algorithms. Four patients had CTCVI, MR angiography, and DSA (42 vessels studied) and nine patients had CTCVI and DSA (136 vessels studied). Scores of 1 (not present) to 3 (present in continuity to the first bifurcation) were assigned independently by two radiologists to 32 vessels in each correlated case for each available technique. RESULTS: There were no technical failures. CTCVI depicted 18 thrombosed dural sinuses, three vascular malformations, one intracranial aneurysm, and four tumors. Ninety-five percent of the vessels seen with DSA were also seen with CTCVI. CTCVI identified all vessels seen on MR angiography. CONCLUSION: Helical CTCVI is an effective technique for assessing the intracranial circulation in children. In this initial comparison, CTCVI showed more vascular detail than MR angiography, and had fewer technical limitations.
