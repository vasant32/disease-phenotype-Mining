We were presented with a teenage female who developed superior ophthalmic vein thrombosis and cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis after a 1-week history of a single acne-like lesion or furuncle at the anterior tip of the nose. She was managed aggressively with heparin and intravenous antibiotic. Signs and symptoms improved after 2 weeks of treatment, and she was discharged with an anticoagulant.
