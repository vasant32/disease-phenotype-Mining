A 25-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of convulsions after delivering a baby. Her neurological examination revealed a disturbance of consciousness and weakness in both arms. A brain magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI) showed thrombosis of the left transverse sinus and many patchy high signals at bilateral basal ganglia and subcortical areas. A digital subtraction angiogram (DSA) of the brain revealed a defect at the left transverse sinus, congestion of the cerebral venous flow at the vein of Galen and vasospastic changes at both posterior cerebral arteries. After treating the patient with a venous infusion of heparin, nicardipine and phenytoin, her neurological deficits improved within a day. When MRI and DSA were repeated 2 weeks later, the abnormal lesions had disappeared. These findings suggest that venous thrombosis and vasospasm had the pathogenesis of eclampsia in this case.
