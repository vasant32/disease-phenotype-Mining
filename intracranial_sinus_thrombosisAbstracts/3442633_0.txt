A 42-year-old man was admitted to the Saiseikai Fukuoka General Hospital on March 22, 1985 with complaints of nausea, vomiting and headache which had continued for twelve days. On physical examinations, multiple subcutaneous nodules were noted in the chest, abdomen and extremities with dilated veins in the chest wall. Furthermore, the discoloration of the skin attributable to the venous occlusion was noted in the left foot. Neurological examinations failed to reveal any abnormalities except for moderate choked disc in bilateral ocular fundi. Spinal puncture revealed CSF pressure as high as 350 mmH2O with slight increase in cell numbers. CT demonstrated small intracerebral hematomas bilaterally in occipital lobes with evidence of "empty delta" sign in the superior sagittal sinus. On angiographical findings, the superior sagittal sinus was not demonstrated in venous phase and the blood was drained mainly through the paravertebral plexus and the pterygoid plexus without any abnormalities in arterial and capillary phases. Serological examination revealed a hypercoagulability and hyperlipidemia especially in LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein) and VLDL (Very Low Density Lipoprotein). On etiological considerations, all of these abnormalities seemed to be derived from the hyperlipidemia. Furthermore, multiple symmetrical lipomatosis was defined as a "lipoprotein storage disease" in which laboratory examinations revealed hyperlipidemia especially in LDL and in some subfraction of HDL. Although not a typical case, there must be some possibilities that the lipomatosis of this case is secondary to disorder of lipid metabolisms. In conclusion, all of various pathological conditions observed in this case were considered to be due to the disorder of lipid metabolism.
