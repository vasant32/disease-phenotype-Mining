OBJECTIVE: To study 12 cases of multiple thrombosis in cerebral venous sinuses and the diagnosis and endovascular therapy. METHOD: The long T2 and short T1 signals in the related region of multiple venous sinuses on MR were important characteristics for the diagnosis before angiography. In the 12 cases, the treatment consisted of intermittent injection of urokinase via common carotid artery and oral administration of warfarin. RESULTS: Intracranial pressure of 11 cases reduced to lower than 300 mm H2O and clinical deficits were markedly improved in 10 days. Re-angiography of 4 cases found partial recanalization in 2 in one week after therapy. CONCLUSION: Intraoarterial thrombolysis combined with general anticoagulation in the treatment of multiple thrombosis in cerebral venous sinuses may be an effective meansure.
