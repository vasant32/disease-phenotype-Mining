 AIM: To assess the incidence rates (IR), clinical characteristics, risk factors, treatment and outcomes of paediatric arterial ischaemic stroke (AIS) and cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT). METHODS: Using population-based, nationwide medical registries, we identified all patients aged 0-18 years at the time of hospitalization with first-ever AIS and/or CSVT in Denmark between 1994 and 2006. Medical records were retrieved and reviewed. RESULTS: We identified 211 patients with AIS and 40 patients with CSVT corresponding to IRs of 1.33 (95% CI 1.16-1.52) and 0.25 (95% CI 0.19-0.34) per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The IRs peaked in infancy (<1 year) for both AIS and CSVT with an additional peak among adolescents (15-18 years) for CSVT. The IR of AIS increased 3.9% per year (p=0.036), whereas no changes were found for CSVT. In total, 48.2% of the patients received antithrombotic treatment; no major complications were observed. All-cause and thrombosis-related 30-day case fatality ratios were 3.6% and 2.4%, respectively; neurological sequelae were found in 56.2% of patients. CONCLUSION: The IR of AIS was highest in infants and had increased with 3.9% annually during the observation period. The IR of CSVT had an additional peak in adolescence and remained unchanged over time.
