The short-term results of the Foerster-Dandy operation in 9 patients with spasmodic torticollis had been studied retrospectively. A good result was obtained for dyskinetic movement, but less for head tilt. Neck pains improved in 4 patients, but developed in 2 other patients postoperatively. Limitation of neck motility and abduction of the arms was seen in all patients. One patient died following a cerebral sinus thrombosis. Other surgical procedures are discussed and the results of studies of anterior rhizotomy are compared. The Foerster-Dandy procedure is indicated for severe disability or pain of more than 2 years duration not responding to other treatments.
