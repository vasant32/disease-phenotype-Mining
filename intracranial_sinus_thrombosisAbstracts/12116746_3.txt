BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has shown high sensitivity in the diagnosis of acute arterial strokes. The pathophysiology of cerebral venous thrombosis with associated venous stroke appears to differ from that of arterial strokes. The purpose of this study was to describe DWI findings in venous strokes. METHODS: The authors reviewed 3 adults with superior sagittal sinus thrombosis who underwent DWI and magnetic resonance imaging within 24 hours of symptom onset. DWI was obtained at 1.5 T using the multishot echo planar technique (TR = 8000, TE = 97, field of view = 30 x 19 cm, slice thickness = 6.0 mm, interslice gap = 0.5 mm, matrix 128 x 128, NEX = 1). The diffusion gradients were applied in 3 orthogonal directions with 3 increasing b values (0-1000 s/mm2) to create average (trace) DWI images. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis and displayed as ADC maps. RESULTS: DWI showed hyperintensities in patients 1 and 2 and hypointensity in patient 3 in corresponding to parenchymal lesions on conventional images. As compared to the homologous uninvolved location in the contralateral hemisphere, ADC values were decreased (0.53 x 10(-3) mm2/s [patient 1] and 0.68 x 10(-3) mm2/s [patient 2]) and increased (1.1 x 10(-3) mm2/s [patient 3]). The ADC ratio of the lesion in the involved to uninvolved side was 88% (patient 1), 81% (patient 2), and 120% (patient 3). CONCLUSION: Acute cerebral venous strokes may contain cytotoxic edema and/or vasogenic edema on DWI scans. DWI may be helpful in diagnosing cerebral venous thrombosis in cases with cryptic presentations.
