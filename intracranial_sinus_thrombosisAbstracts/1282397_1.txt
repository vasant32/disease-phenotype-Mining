A 67-year old man with prostate cancer showed Balint's syndrome, memory disturbance, anosognosia and hallucinations after having been comatose. Radiological findings indicated bilateral dural arteriovenous malformation (DAVM) and thrombosis at the bilateral transverse sinuses and superior sagittal sinus. Pathological findings showed abnormally dilated veins, diffuse neuron loss and gliosis in the parieto-occipital lobe. The chlormadinone and prostate cancer are speculated to have caused the dural sinus thrombosis which probably induced the DAVM.
