The role of free radicals in the pathogenesis of arterial stroke is well documented but not in venous stroke. The aim of the study was to investigate the possible role of free radicals in the pathogenesis of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). For inducing CVST in Sprague-Dawley rats, a cranial window was made to expose the superior sagittal sinus (SSS). On the exposed sinus, a strip of filter paper soaked with 40% ferric chloride was applied. In the control rats 0.9% saline was used instead of ferric chloride. After induction of sinus thrombosis, clinical evaluations were done on days 1, 2 and 7 for neurological deficit, weight of thrombus and brain lesion volume. In neuronal-rich cell preparations flow cytometric estimations were done at different time points. In the study group on sequential follow-up, there was spontaneous recanalization of SSS as well as a significant decrease in brain lesion volume. An insignificant improvement in neurological deficit was also observed. In the controls, there was no neurological deficit or evidence of infarction. Neuronal free radical levels were significantly increased in the study group on day 1 compared to controls, but on follow-up free radicals levels decreased. It is concluded that the free radicals increase in the early stage of venous stroke and may be important in its pathogenesis.
