The authors report a case of cortical vein and sagittal sinus thrombosis after a transcallosal removal of a colloid cyst of the third ventricle. Thirty-six hours after the operation, the patient developed focal seizures; after progressive deterioration, he died on the sixth postoperative day. At the autopsy, a venous hemorrhagic infarct in the right frontoparietal area and fresh thrombus occluding the sagittal sinus and cortical veins were found. The mechanism of cortical vein and sinus thrombosis subsequent to this procedure is discussed, and suggestions are made to prevent this serious complication.
