BACKGROUND: Sigmoid sinus thrombosis occurring after closed head injury in childhood is rare. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report such a case with the clinical presentation, radiological findings and current literature. CONCLUSION: Skull should be undertaken as a significant risk factor for the cerebrovascular venous thrombosis in order to evaluate unexpected clinical outcomes. An evaluation for predisposing factors is mandatory. Therapeutic measurements decelerate the thrombotic process trying not to increase the hemorrhagic risk.
