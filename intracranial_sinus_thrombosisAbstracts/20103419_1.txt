AIM: To assess the value of unenhanced brain computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Unenhanced brain CT images of 26 patients with proven CVST were mixed with 26 age and sex-matched images from patients without CVST. Four readers reviewed the 52 brain CT images and were asked to score the examinations for the absence or presence of CVST on a scale from 0 to 4. The mean density in the different venous sinuses was measured by one radiologist. RESULTS: The sensitivity of unenhanced brain CT for the diagnosis of CVST was 73%. There were no false-positive readings. A receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis on these data resulted in an area under the curve of 0.86. Density measurements proved to be helpful, but could not detect all cases of CVST. CONCLUSION: Unenhanced brain CT is a valid initial radiological examination in the diagnosis of CVST. Due to the absence of false-positives in the present series, unenhanced CT can be used to decide whether further imaging with CT angiography or magnetic resonance angiography is required.
