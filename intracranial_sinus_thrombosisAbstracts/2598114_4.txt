Mucormycosis is a rare fungal disease most often encountered in patients who are diabetic, immunocompromised, severely burned, or who have a history of intravenous drug abuse. Intracranial presentation includes the isolated cerebral and the more common rhinocerebral forms. The computed tomography picture in mucormycosis is well documented. The magnetic resonance (MR) findings associated with mucormycosis have not been previously described. We report a case of rhinocerebral mucormycosis in a poorly controlled diabetic man where the MR findings of cavernous sinus thrombosis and thrombosis of the cavernous portion of the internal carotid artery demonstrated progression of the patient's disease in spite of his stable clinica course. The results of the MR findings directly altered the patient's therapy, thus leading to a favorable outcome.
