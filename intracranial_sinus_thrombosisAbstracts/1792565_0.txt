Lateral sinus trombophlebitis and sepsis otogenes are rare complications of chronic osteitic otitis, but often resulting in delayed recognition and high mortality rate. During ten years in the period 1979-1989, we cured 5 patients with lateral sinus pathology and sepsis otogenes. All patients were successfully cured by surgical and conservative treatment. The incidence of these complications in our results confirm the events in recent literature that it is rare but complex condition with widespread clinical features which may range from subtle signs to gross toxaemia.
