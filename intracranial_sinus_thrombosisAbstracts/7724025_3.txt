Three cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) occurring in patients with minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) are described. Personality change in two of these patients was wrongly attributed to steroid therapy prior to the discovery of the CVST. In addition, von Willebrand factor (vWF) levels were grossly elevated in one patient, during a previous relapse of MCNS, prior to developing CVST, and may be a useful prognostic tool in predicting thrombotic events in nephrotic patients.
