 BACKGROUND: Parasagittal meningiomas invading the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) pose formidable obstacles to surgical management. Invasion is often considered a contraindication to surgery because of associated morbidity, such as cerebral venous thrombosis. OBJECTIVE: We report our most recent experience with the resection of parasagittal meningiomas invading the SSS. METHODS: Between 1992 and 2004, 110 patients with parasagittal meningiomas underwent surgery at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions. Clinical charts, radiological studies, pathological features, and operative notes were retrospectively analyzed; only those patients with minimum 24 months follow-up (n = 61) were further studied. RESULTS: Tumor distribution by location along the SSS was: 21% anterior, 62% middle, and 17% posterior. All patients were managed with initial surgical resection with radiosurgery for residual/recurrent disease if indicated (19.6%). Pathological examination revealed 80% grade I meningiomas, 13% grade II meningiomas, and 7% grade III meningiomas. Simpson grade I/II resection was achieved in 81% of patients. Major complications included venous thrombosis/infarction (7%), intraoperative air embolism (1.5%), and death (1.5%); long-term outcomes assessed included recurrence (11%) and improvement in Karnofsky Performance Score (85%). CONCLUSION: On the basis of our study, the incidence of postoperative venous sinus thrombosis is 7% in the setting of a recurrence rate of 11% with a mean follow-up of 41 months. In comparison with the published literature, the data corroborate the rationale for our treatment paradigm; lesions invading the sinus can initially be resected to the greatest extent possible without excessive manipulation of vascular structures, whereas residual/recurrent disease can be observed and managed with radiosurgery.
