A 39-year-old woman presented with a 2-month history of repeated severe headache, nausea and diplopia. On admission she was obese with bilateral papilledma and abducens weakness. Mass lesion and sinus thrombosis were ruled out by brain CT and angiography. CSF pressure was normal initially. CSF pressure fluctuated with menstrual cycle, sometimes showing over 600 mmH2O with worsening of the symptoms. She was diagnosed as benign intracranial hypertension (BIH). Diuretics did not improve the symptoms, and visual disturbances ensued and deteriorated. A spinal subarachnoid space-peritoneal shunt was inserted to control CSF pressure, showing rapid improvement of headache and diplopia but visual disturbances remained almost unchanged. Optic nerve sheath fenestration was performed without improvement of visual deterioration. We postulated multiple factors such as obesity, menstrual abnormality, iron deficiency anemia and analgesic drugs played important roles to produce BIH in this case. Careful quantitative perimetry should be done to decide a suitable time for surgical treatment in BIH.
