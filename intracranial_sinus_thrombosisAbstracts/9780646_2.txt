Four patients with multiple intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) at separate sites were treated by endovascular techniques (transarterial and/or transvenous embolization), surgery (excision or isolation), radiotherapy, or combinations, according to the pathophysiological condition. All lesions in two patients were obliterated completely without neurological deficit. There were residual fistulas after the treatment in two patients, but these were low-grade lesions without retrograde cortical venous drainage, and marked clinical improvement was obtained. Planning of treatment strategies for multiple DAVFs requires careful analysis of the venous drainage from the affected sinuses and cerebral hemodynamics.
