We report a case of dural venous sinus thrombosis (DVST) in a patient who developed seizures following exchange transfusion for treatment of acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease. Evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance venography of the brain indicated left sigmoid sinus thrombosis. The history and laboratory evaluation did not reveal any other inherited or acquired hypercoagulable states. This is the fourth case of dural venous sinus thrombosis associated with sickle cell disease reported in literature. The patient had a favorable outcome with early treatment of unfractionated heparin.
