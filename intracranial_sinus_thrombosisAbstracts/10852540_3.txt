The authors report on a series of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhages associated with vein of Galen aneurysmal malformations (VGAMs). Thirty-four children with VGAMs have been treated at this institution since 1986. Eight children (24%) harbored the mural-type malformation, and 26 (76%) had the choroidal-type lesion. Two children (25%) with mural lesions and 1 (4%) with a choroidal lesion suffered hemorrhagic complications. Two presented with acute intracranial hemorrhage. A third child developed acute intracranial hemorrhage due to delayed dural sinus thrombosis after endovascular treatment of his choroidal-type VGAM. The subjects ranged in age from 13 days to 17 months at the time of presentation. Each patient underwent rapid radiological evaluation and treatment with endovascular surgery. Post-procedural arteriography demonstrated complete occlusion of the malformation in each patient. For the 3 patients with hemorrhage, follow-up has taken place over 49-, 107-, and 43-month intervals, respectively. Vein of Galen aneurysmal malformations can present with acute intracranial hemorrhage or develop delayed intracranial hemorrhage but respond to treatment using standard endovascular techniques. The presence of hemorrhage does not de facto portend a poor prognosis.
