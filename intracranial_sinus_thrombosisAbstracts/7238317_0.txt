In a 38-year-old patient who had taken oral contraceptives for several years partial thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus and cortical veins occurred. Progress could be observed with the computer assisted tomography (CAT). CAT showed multiple localised intracerebral haemorrhages fronto-occipitally and penetrating deep into the white matter. In view of the severity of morphological changes the ability for regression of such haemorrhages is surprising. This equally applies to subsequent restitution without substantial visible defects in cerebral parenchyma following treatment with heparin. Among the presentations of sinus and central venous thromboses in CAT, the empty triangle or delta sign and the cord sign should be mentioned.
