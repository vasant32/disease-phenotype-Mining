We report a case of vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation (VGAM) with a newly developed dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF) subsequent to successful embolization. A male neonate diagnosed as VGAM with prenatal ultrasonography and MRI presented severe cardiac and respiratory failure soon after birth. Five sessions of transarterial embolization using NBCA were performed during the first 6 months of his life. The shunt flow was effectively reduced and heart failure was resolved after the treatment. Follow-up angiography performed 2.5 years after the last embolization revealed complete obliteration of VGAM and newly developed small dural AVF on the wall of the thrombosed falcorial sinus. We believe that the dural AVF in this case was caused by local venous hypertension or induction of angiogenic factor during the thrombosing process of VGAM.
