 OBJECTIVE: Evaluating intracranial complications of otitis media. DESIGN: An Evaluative study of 106 cases of intracranial complications secondary to otitis media. INTERVENTION: Diagnosis is based on history, clinical exam (general, systemic and ENT), investigations hemogram, X-ray mastoid CT scan brain and mastoid. TREATMENT: Medical management:IV Higher Antibiotics.Surgery for complicating pathology:Pus (in Abscesses)-bram canula aspiration.Lateral sinus thrombosis (thrombus removal),Otitic hydrocephalus (epidural catheterization).Primary disease eradication:Exploration of mastoid. RESULTS: Fully recovered patients without residual neurodeficit (85%), Morbidity (6%) CSF otorrhoea secondary to otitic hydrocephalus (9%) Mortality: preoperative (3%) and postoperative (6%). CONCLUSION: Otological approaches for management of cases of intracranial complications of otitis media are equally comparable with results by neurosurgical approaches of management. Therefore, holding promise if applied in the rural and peripheral parts of India with limited resources even with absence of the expertise of Neurosurgical Department.
