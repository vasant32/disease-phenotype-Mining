In a 6-month period, three patients aged 5-11 years were transferred to our tertiary care children's hospital for management of severe complications following adenotonsillectomy. The first patient presented with headaches and lethargy and was found to have a sagittal sinus thrombosis from severe dehydration. The second patient was admitted immediately following an intra-operative oral cavity fire due to electrocautery malfunction. She suffered partial-thickness burns to the buccal mucosa, palate, and lips. The third patient was admitted with torticollis. Grisel's syndrome was initially suspected, but a thorough work up resulted in the diagnosis of a conversion disorder. These cases comprise an interesting cohort of three little-known complications of adenotonsillectomy.
