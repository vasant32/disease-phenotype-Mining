We present two cases of acute thrombosis of the internal cerebral veins, vein of Galen, and straight sinus without sagittal sinus involvement. Both patients had hydrocephalus and severe edema of the basal ganglia and thalami, one with hemorrhagic infarction of the thalamus. Because both patients rapidly deteriorated to a comatose state, endovascular thrombolysis was performed with urokinase infusion of the deep venous structures. Thrombolysis was continued until a patent channel with brisk flow in the venous structures was achieved. Both patients survived with minimal neurologic deficits.
