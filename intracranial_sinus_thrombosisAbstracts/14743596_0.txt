INTRODUCTIONS: The diagnosis of dural sinus thrombosis despite of using modern imaging techniques still remains a difficult problem. For satisfactory interpretation of CT and MR scans it is indispensably important the knowledge of anatomical variations and possible imaging artifacts. One of the relatively rare developmental variations--giving chance for making false positive diagnosis--is the occipital sinus with hypoplasia or agenesis of transverse sinus. CASE REPORTS CONCLUSION: The incidence, the anatomical classification, the importance and the possibility of differentiation from sinus thrombosis are reviewed based on case reports of four patients.
