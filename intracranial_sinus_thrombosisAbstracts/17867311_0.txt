A 61-year-old man presented with consciousness disorders. Computed tomography revealed bilateral frontal SAH and hematoma in the right temporo-parietal region. His condition deteriorated despite conservative treatment and hematoma became enlarged. The angiographic diagnosis was extensive sinus thrombosis from the superior sagittal sinus to the bilateral transverse sinus. Therefore, mechanical clot disruption was performed under systemic anticoagulation using PTA balloons catheter and a rheolytic catheter via the right internal jugular vein. Excellent angiographic results were obtained, and the patient recovered gradually. Six months after treatment, the patient had only upper quadrant hemianopsia and no other neurologic deficit. Our experience suggests that mechanical clot disruption with systemic anticoagulation as a safe effective treatment for cerebral sinus thrombosis, especially in patient whom had large intraparenchymal hematoma.
