The case reported here is the first observation of thrombophlebitis of the superior sagittal and left transverse sinuses in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus. Thrombophlebitis occurred thirty-six years after onset of SLE. The patient had neither nephrotic syndrome nor serum anti-coagulants. Various hypotheses concerning pathogenesis are suggested. The opportunity for heparin therapy is discussed.
