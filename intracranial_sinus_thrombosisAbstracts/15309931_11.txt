Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is often difficult to manage. Treatment options include systemically delivered anticoagulation therapy or chemical thrombolysis. Targeted endovascular delivery of thrombolytic agents is currently a popular option, but it carries an increased risk of hemorrhage. These strategies require significant time to produce thrombolysis, often in a patient with a rapidly deteriorating neurological condition. Rapid mechanical recanalization with thrombectomy is therefore very attractive; this procedure provides rapid recanalization with no increased risk of hemorrhage from use of thrombolytic agents. Nevertheless, the rheolytic catheter is large and stiff and may not be able to navigate tortuous intracranial vascular anatomy. The authors present their experience with direct dural sinus mechanical thrombectomy performed using the rheolytic catheter via a transcranial route. Two patients with dural sinus thrombosis and rapidly deteriorating levels of consciousness underwent unsuccessful attempts at mechanical thrombolysis via the usual transfemoral route. Through a burr hole over the dural sinus, mechanical thrombectomy was subsequently performed using the thrombectomy catheter. Sinus patency was restored following treatment and both patients demonstrated neurological recovery. Hemorrhage or a rapidly deteriorating neurological condition may preclude the use of systemic or locally delivered thrombolytic agents for the treatment of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Mechanical thrombectomy may be the treatment of choice in these circumstances. In patients with limited transfemoral access, a transcranial approach may be used to access the cerebral dural sinuses and thrombectomy may be safely and effectively performed. Further evaluation of this therapy is warranted.
