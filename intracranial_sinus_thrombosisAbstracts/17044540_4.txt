OBJECTIVES: Dural sinus thrombosis commonly presents with headache, and rarely with tinnitus. These thromboses can progress to neurologic impairment and death. We are sharing recent clinical experiences with these thromboses as they present to the otologist. METHODS: We report the presentation, physical examination, and imaging studies of 4 patients. RESULTS: Four women had thrombotic occlusion of the sigmoid sinus. Their only symptoms were focal headache in all 4 patients, and unilateral pulsatile tinnitus in 2 of them. Imaging studies had to be repeated or alternative testing performed in order to conclusively identify the problem. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to be vigilant for the possibility of sigmoid sinus thrombosis in women who complain of unilateral head pain or unilateral pulsatile tinnitus. Appropriate imaging must be performed.
