A 37-year-old woman presented with cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis (CVST). During the period of anticoagulation she developed asymptomatic dissection of the intracranial segments of both vertebral arteries with an enlarging false aneurysm on the right side. Endovascular occlusion of the pathological segment of the right vertebral artery including the dissecting aneurysm and conservative management of the other side resulted in complete recovery without neurological complications.
