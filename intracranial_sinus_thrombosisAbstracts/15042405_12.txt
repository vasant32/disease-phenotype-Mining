We assessed the feasibility of MR digital subtraction angiography (DSA) using parallel imaging and keyhole data sampling in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs) in 11 patients. Their diseases included arterial trunk stenosis/occlusion ( n=4), aneurysm ( n=3), arteriovenous malformation ( n=2), venous angioma ( n=1), and sinus thrombosis ( n=1). The technique depicted not only anatomical features, comparably to MR angiography ( n=10/11), but also hemodynamics such as collateral flow at a temporal resolution of 1.68 s/frame. When compared with conventional angiograms ( n=7), details were missed in four patients (incomplete demonstration of aneurysmal neck in two and poor separation of AVM components in two). Although inferior to conventional angiography, this technique can provide both anatomical and hemodynamic information of CVDs.
