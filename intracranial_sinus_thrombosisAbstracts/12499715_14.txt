To describe early symptomatic and late seizures in a cohort of patients with acute cerebral vein and dural sinus thrombosis (CVDST) and to identify their determinants, we performed a prospective registry and follow-up study of CVDST patients admitted to 20 Portuguese hospitals, from June 1995 to June 1998. Of 91 registered patients, 31 (34%) had early symptomatic seizures; 29 (31.9%) as a presenting feature and 2 (2.1%) after admission. Early symptomatic seizures were more frequent in patients with motor and sensory deficits and in those with focal oedema/ischaemic infarcts or haemorrhages on admission CT/MR. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, sensory defects (OR = 7.8; 95% CI = 0.8-74.8) and a parenchymal lesion on admission CT/MR (OR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.4-9.4) were found to be significant predictors of early symptomatic seizures. Seizures were directly related to acute death in 2 patients. Eight (9.5%) patients had late seizures, which were multiple in 4 (4.8%). Late seizures were more frequent in patients with early symptomatic seizures and with haemorrhage on admission CT/MR. Neither early symptomatic seizures nor late seizures were related to functional prognosis at the last follow-up (median = 1 year). There is a moderate risk of seizure recurrence early in the course and during the first year after CVDST. Seizures can be a cause of acute death, but might not have an independent influence on functional outcome. Pharmacological prevention of seizures after CVDST should probably be limited to patients with early symptomatic seizures and cerebral lesions on admission CT/MR.
