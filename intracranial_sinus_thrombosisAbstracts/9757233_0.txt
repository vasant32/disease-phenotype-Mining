Transcranial Duplex scan is a relatively recent diagnostic tool with many unexplored clinical potentials. The authors insist on the role of transocular exploration, as a non-invasive substitute to angiography and discuss two patients with cavernous meningeal arteriovenous fistula, a benign but relatively uncommon disease. In the first patient, in whom symptoms recurred, Duplex scan was able to rule out thrombophlebitis and to show increased flow in the fistula, thus leading to proper treatment. In the second patient, the identification of a periorbital thrombophlebitis innocented the fistula and prompted anti-coagulation. We conclude that besides its diagnostic capabilities, Duplex scan may be helpful in selecting proper treatment and follow-up in specific neurovascular conditions.
