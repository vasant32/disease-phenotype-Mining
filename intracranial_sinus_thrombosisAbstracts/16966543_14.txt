OBJECTIVE: To determine whether treatments guidelines for lower extremity venous thrombosis (DVT) could be applied to patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), the rates of recurrent venous thrombosis and survival for these two diseases were compared. METHODS: The authors studied all patients diagnosed with CVST at the Mayo Clinic between 1978 and 2001. Survival and recurrent venous thrombosis rates (cerebral or noncerebral) were compared with those from patients with DVT. Survival rates were also compared with white US residents. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-four patients (age 40 +/- 19 years) were included (58% women). Warfarin, prescribed in 50% of patients, was continued for an average of 9 months. During a mean of follow up of 36 +/- 47 months (464 patient-years), 20 patients experienced 23 recurrent venous thrombi for an event rate of 5.0/100 patient-years. This recurrence rate was similar to patients with lower extremity DVT (3.8/100 patient-years). Mortality rates were lower for CVST (2.8/100 patient-years) compared with DVT (6.2/100 patient-years; p = 0.001) patients but higher than expected for white US residents (p = 0.001). Increasing age and active malignancy were the only predictors of poor survival. Neither recurrent thrombosis nor survival was influenced by warfarin therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of recurrent venous thrombosis is similar after cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) and lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Compared with DVT, survival rates are higher following CVST but are adversely influenced by malignancy and older age.
