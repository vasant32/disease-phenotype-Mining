While a dural sinus thrombosis (DST), is a well-known consequence of the use of oral contraceptives, the role of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in DST was not previously evaluated. We report two postmenopausal women, presenting with DST under HRT. Antiphospholipid antibodies in one case and borderline protein S deficiency in another were diagnosed. Only five cases of DST under HRT were previously reported and in two of them additional prothrombotic risk factors were found. According to these and previous cases, HRT is not an independent risk factor for DST.
