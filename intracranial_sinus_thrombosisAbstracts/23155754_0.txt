Tromboembolic complications are 2-4-fold more likely in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) than in healthy individuals; active IBD may increase the relative risk even 15-fold. Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are the most common involvements, but also atypical forms occur. We describe such uncommon thrombotic manifestations in two IBD patients: one had mesenterial vein and the other cavernoid sinus thrombosis. The risk of thrombotic complications should be estimated individually, and prophylactic management with low molecular weight heparin should be considered in hospitalized IBD patients.
