Dural sinus thrombosis (DST) has an annual incidence of 3-4 per million and can result from many aetiologies. Presentation of the disease can vary considerably, as can the aetiology and delay of symptoms to clinical detection. Symptoms on presentation include headache, seizures, focal neural deficits and altered mental status. There are many aetiological risk factors associated with DST, which include hypercoagulable states, oral contraceptive use, infection and mechanical causes such as cranial trauma. DST as a result of trauma is rare and aetiologies range from mechanical falls with or without skull fracture, firework explosions, gunshots to the head, blunt trauma to the head and closed head injury. Internal jugular vein thrombosis is also a rare disease and as with DST, traumatic aetiologies are uncommon. More common aetiologies include iatrogenic causes related to catheterisation as well as infectious causes (eg, Lemierre's syndrome). A case of thrombosis of the transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus and internal jugular vein associated with a closed head injury as the result of a motorcycle accident is presented.
