 BACKGROUND: Intracranial MR venography is useful for the diagnosis of dural sinus thrombosis and the preoperative assessment of sinus patency encased by tumors. Recently, contrast-enhanced MR venography has been applied for suspected dural sinus occlusion in a shorter time. However, it has some disadvantage for the evaluation of hypervascularized enhancing thrombus mimicking flow in chronic sinus thrombosis. So far, we have evaluated optimal imaging technique and slice orientation and have shown that sagittal three-dimensional (3D) -phase contrast (PC) imaging is the most suitable for the non-contrast intracranial MR venography. PURPOSE: To assess the optimal presaturation pulse (SAT) and velocity encoding (VENC) for the non-contrast intracranial 3D-PC MR venography. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Firstly, we performed phantom experiment to assess the best SAT thickness using arterial presaturation. Second, MR imaging was performed in 7 healthy volunteers to measure the dural sinus flow velocity using a 1.5 T MR. Third, 3D-PC MR venography was performed with a VENC settings at 10, 15, 20 and 30 cm/sec for healthy volunteers. All data were displayed as maximum intensity projection images and three neuroradiologists assessed the visibility of the dural sinuses and the cortical vein. RESULTS: The mean flow velocity of the dural sinuses was 6.3 cm/sec. The thickness of the best SAT was 100 mm. In the assessment of the visibility of the 3D-PC images, dural sinuses were adequately visualized at a VENC of 15 cm/sec. CONCLUSIONS: Non-contrast intracranial 3D-PC MR venography was optimized at 100mm thickness of SAT and a VENC of 15 cm/sec.
