Dural venous sinus thrombosis is an important complication of L-asparaginase chemotherapy. The diagnosis and followup of this condition, using spin echo and fast imaging techniques, is described in three patients. Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging is a rapid, noninvasive technique for diagnosis and follow-up of this condition. Fast imaging techniques can improve the assessment of these patients.
