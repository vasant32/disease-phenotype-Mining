A rare case of dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) in the superior sagittal sinus (SSS), the transverse sinus and the sigmoid sinus is reported. A 64-year-old man, who had had an episode of temporary visual disturbance after moderate fever for a week about 20 years before, was aware of loss of visual acuity and reduced field of view in the right eye. When he was introduced to our outpatient service, increased intracranial pressure (ICP) was detected by lumbar puncture. Cerebral angiograms showed bilateral DAVFs both in the posterior fossa and the SSS concomitant with thrombosis in the transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus and SSS. Afterwards, endovascular transarterial embolization through bilateral occipital, posterior auricular and left middle meningeal, superior temporal arteries was carried out. In addition, transvenous thrombolytic therapy using a catheter inserted into SSS resulted in the improvement of his visual problems. Although he was discharged at once, he was readmitted to our department with Foster Kennedy syndrome and increased ICP. Cerebral angiograms showed recurrence of both DAVF and sinus thrombosis. Transarterial embolization was performed again resulting in a significant reduction of DAVF, and his visual acuity was recovered to a moderate degree. The origin of DAVF is still controversial. Although two theories, "congenital" and "acquired", are put forward, it has been thought that both factors play important roles. In our case, the patient had stenosis in the jugular canal portions of the sigmoid sinus. In addition, sinus thrombosis seemed to have occurred. It is thought that increased intrasinus pressure may have lead to communication with surrounding arteries through existing dural vessels. We applied transvenous thrombolytic therapy in this case. Our result suggests that we should consider this therapy for some cases of DAVF.
