OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical features and imaging diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis. METHODS: 65 cases of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) were proved by angiography (n = 34) or MR (n = 44), 30 by both procedures and 6 by pathology as well. Their age ranged from 13 to 59 years (mean age 32.5), 31 were male and 34 were female. RESULTS: The clinical manifestations were variable, but most patients had symptoms and signs of intracranial hypertension (91%)such as headache and papilledema. Nearly half of the patients had focal neurological dysfunction (49%) such as weakness of limbs and seizures and half of the patients had intracranial hypertension (51%) only. The occluded dural sinus and the clot could be visualised directly by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). CONCLUSION: MRI and MRA are becoming the imaging investigation of choice for the diagnosis of CVT, Anticoagulation, thrombolysis and dextran may be effective measures in the treatment of cerebral venous thrombosis.
