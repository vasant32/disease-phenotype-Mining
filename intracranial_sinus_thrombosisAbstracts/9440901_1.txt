PURPOSE: To perform an initial evaluation of the accuracy in detection of dural sinus and cerebral venous thrombosis using a bed-side test (SimpliRED). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Early diagnosis and treatment of cerebral sinus thrombosis are important. A screening test to decide which patients should undergo further diagnostics would be valuable due to the low incidence. Six patients with MR proven cerebral sinus thrombosis underwent bed-side testing. The SimpliRED kit provides a clearly visible agglutination of the patient's red blood cells in the presence of elevated levels of the crosslinked fibrin derivative (D-dimer) in the sample. RESULTS: The assay yielded a positive result in all six patients, even 56 days following the onset of clinical symptoms. CONCLUSION: The sensitivity of SimpliRED in the detection of sinus venous thrombosis is not known. This assay, therefore, should be evaluated in a large prospective study. In addition, the capability of the test to assess the effect of and predict the duration of anticoagulation therapy should be considered.
