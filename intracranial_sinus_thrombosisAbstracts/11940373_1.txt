OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pathogenesis, clinical features, radiographic findings and therapeutic outcomes of non-acute intracranial deep venous thrombosis in adults. METHODS: Five patients who presented with increased intracranial pressure were examined with computed tomography, magnetic resonance and angiography, diagnosed as having non-acute intracranial deep venous thrombosis, and treated with thrombolytic therapy. They were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: There were 3 men and 2 women, aged from 22 to 49 years. Symptom duration ranged from 1 month to 7 months, and 4 of the 5 patients were associated with venous sinus thrombosis. Two patients developed cold and fever before the onset of disease, and 3 patients had no evident predisposing factors. After the infusion of thrombolytic and systemic anti-coagulant therapy, the neurological symptoms and signs of the patients were alleviated. CONCLUSIONS: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is more sensitive and accurate than MRI on diagnosing intracranial deep venous thrombosis. It may play an important role in the assessment of the treatment of intracranial deep venous thrombosis. Thrombolysis and anticoagulation of intracranial deep venous thrombosis appears to be a safe and efficacious treatment not only in the acute stage but also in the non-acute stage.
