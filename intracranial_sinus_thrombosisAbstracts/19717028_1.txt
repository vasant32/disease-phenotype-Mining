We report on a rare case of a patient with rhinocerebral mucormycosis that presented as intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). A 54-year-old man who was immunosuppressed had ophthalmoplegia. Four days later, ICH developed in his left frontal lobe. The ICH was surgically removed totally. Pathology specimen surgically obtained from brain surface adjacent to hematoma cavity showed blood vessels filled with Mucor mycelium. Combined with surgical findings, venous occlusion by Mucor mycelium might be the cause of ICH in the patient.
