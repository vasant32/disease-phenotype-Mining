Along with the jugular veins, the vertebral veins serve as an important pathway for venous blood returning from the brain. In this study, the authors report duplex sonographic findings in 138 healthy subjects without central nervous disease. Successful insonation was possible in 70.7% of all examined vessels. Bilateral insonation was achieved in 86 subjects (62.3%). Only 1 vertebral vein was detected in 23 persons (16.7%), whereas no vein was found in 29 persons (21%). The authors observed a marked variation of peak flow velocities ranged (5-81 cm/s, mean +/- standard deviation, 23.9 +/- 12.3 cm/s). No significant gender-related or side-to-side differences or age influences on flow velocities were detected. The authors' findings may be of relevance when discussing flow velocities in the vertebral veins in cases of cerebrovenous disorders (e.g., dural sinus thrombosis) or in patients after neck dissection.
