Pediatric deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is an emerging problem in tertiary care hospitals, recent reviews shows a rate of 40.2/10 000 admissions. Experts affirm that enoxaparin has become in the drug of choice for DVT therapy. Despite this, there is a little information regarding the optimal dose schedule for enoxaparin therapy in children and the therapeutic guidelines for enoxaparin use in children are extrapolated from adult guidelines. Monitoring by antifactor Xa (anti-Xa) measurement and target concentrations between 0.5-1 U/ml at 4-6 h postdose are recommended. This study was designed to analyse our experience in paediatric-specific dosage requirements for enoxaparin therapy. A retrospective study was performed with patients less than 16 years old, who were treated with enoxaparin for DVT and monitored by anti-Xa concentration, between January 2005 and March 2012. Demographic and clinical characteristics and outcomes were obtained. Fourteen patients were analyzed: boy/girl ratio, 8/4; median age, 3.5 months. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis was the most common indication for therapy. All patients presented thrombosis risks factors. Dose increases were necessary only in patients less than 6 years old. Target anti-Xa concentrations were achieved in 12 (85%) patients. Children younger than 1 year required a higher dose of enoxaparin/kg (1.5-2.7 mg/kg per 12 h). Complete resolutions of DVT were registered in all cases. The mean number of dose increases was three and a median of 11 days to achieve target anti-Xa concentration. This study indicates that an initial higher enoxaparin dose may be necessary in neonates and infants, but other factors must be considered to improve management.
