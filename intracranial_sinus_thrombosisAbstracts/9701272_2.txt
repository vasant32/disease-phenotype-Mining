BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic and organ transplantations are increasing worldwide with more patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Neurological problems may complicate the posttransplant period. Possible causes include the conditioning regimen (e.g., seizures with busulfan), central nervous system infections (viral, bacterial, and fungal), or factors secondary to the immunosuppressive therapy and side effects of drug treatment (e.g., cyclosporine and tacrolimus). Sinus venous thrombosis, the occlusion of a cerebral venous vessel or a sinus, is an unusual cause of neurologic symptoms in patients after transplantation, and this has not been reported in the literature previously. METHODS: Three patients presenting with various neurological symptoms after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation underwent computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging as a primary diagnostic procedure. RESULTS: In all patients, sinus venous thrombosis was found as the cause for seizures; it was the cause of disturbance of consciousness in two patients and headaches in two patients. All symptoms resolved without any neurologic deficiency after anticoagulation therapy with heparin followed by dicumarol. CONCLUSION: We conclude that sinus venous thrombosis should be considered as a cause of neurological symptoms in patients after transplantation under immunosuppressive therapy. Diagnosis is rapidly confirmed by noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging angiography. Therapeutic heparinization is the treatment of choice.
