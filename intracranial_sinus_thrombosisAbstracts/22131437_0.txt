Dural venous sinus thrombosis, although relatively rare, has the propensity to cause potentially fatal conditions, such as stroke. This review presents the current endovascular treatment and management options for dural venous sinus thrombosis and provides current recommendations. Select databases were utilized for an exhaustive literature search with key search terms in efforts to obtain all relevant cases to endovascular treatment of dural venous sinus thrombosis. Recommendations for management options include initially the use of anticoagulation. For patients with a poor prognosis, local thrombolysis with urokinase or recombinant tissue plasminogen activator should be initiated. Ultimately, if the patient is not a good candidate for local or systemic thrombolysis, treatment via rheolytic thrombectomy should be employed.
