The sphenoid localization of aspergillosis is a rare sinusal disease, often latent or asymptomatic. The neurological complications are the result of invasive forms occurring in most cases for the immunocompromised or diabetic patients. Nevertheless, non-invasive sphenoid aspergillosis may cause also several complications and affect the vital prognosis of nonimmunocompromised patients. This report is about two cases of cavernous sinus thrombosis secondary to a non-invasive sphenoid aspergillosis. The authors refer to the clinical and radiological findings and therapeutic approach of this rare complication.
