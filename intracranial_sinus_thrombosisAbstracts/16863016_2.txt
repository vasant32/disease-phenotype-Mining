We report the case of a 44-year-old man with superior sagittal and transverse sinus thrombi, who initially presented with venous subarachnoid hemorrhage over the right parietal sulci. After 7 days of intravenous anticoagulation therapy, his condition stabilized. Cerebral venous thrombosis can be difficult to diagnose and is further complicated when patients initially present with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage. A high index of clinical suspicion is needed to diagnose venous subarachnoid hemorrhage so that appropriate treatment can be initiated as promptly as possible.
