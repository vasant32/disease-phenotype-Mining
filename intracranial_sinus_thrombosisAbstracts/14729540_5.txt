Sinus pericranii is an unusual venous anomaly characterized by communication of pericranial varicosities with an underlying dural sinus. We report two cases of spontaneous partial thrombosis of sinus pericranii presenting as focally tender, nonreducible mass lesions different in character from the baseline venous abnormality. CT, CT angiography, and CT venography (CTV) were performed in both cases. CTV was essential in depicting thrombi within the varicosities. MR (in one case) demonstrated the anomaly well, but the thrombus was not evident. Conservative therapy was instituted in both cases.
