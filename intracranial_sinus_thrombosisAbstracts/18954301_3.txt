OBJECTIVES: Neurologic complications are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients who undergo transplants. We sought to evaluate the nature and incidence of neurologic complications in patients undergoing a renal transplant. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2005 and December 2007, 132 adults (35 women, 97 men; mean age, 34.32 -/+ 0.90 years) underwent a renal transplant at our institution. Associated comorbid medical conditions, presenting neurologic symptoms, and type of immunosuppression were obtained from patients' medical records. RESULTS: Major indications for renal transplant were hypertensive nephropathy (14.4%), vesicoureteral reflux (11.4%), and idiopathic causes (21.2%). Mean follow-up was 17.26 -/+ 0.89 months (range, 2 weeks to 40 months). Twenty neurologic complications were found in 18 patients (6 women, 12 men; mean age, 33.83 -/+ 2.37 years). Presenting symptoms included posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, 1 (5.6%); cephalgia, 10 (55.6%); cerebral infarcts, 2 (11.1%); seizure, 3 (16.7%); tremor, 2 (11.1%); encephalopathy, 1 (5.6%); and sinus thrombosis, 1 (5.6%). Immunosuppressive agents were the primary cause of 16 of the 20 neurologic complications. Effectiveness and complications of cyclosporinewere screened for a total of 1858.50 months, tacrolimus for 853.50 months, and sirolimus for 620 months; 50.2% of the neurologic complications appeared during the first 3 months after transplant; the blood level of immunosuppressive medications did not need to be higher than normal in every case. DISCUSSION: In addition to cyclosporine and tacrolimus, we suggest (for the first time) sirolimus as a cause of neurocomplications after renal transplant.
