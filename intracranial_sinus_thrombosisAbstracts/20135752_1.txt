We determined platelet-leucocyte complexes, which play roles in the thrombosis-inflammation relationship, in Behçet's disease patients with and without major vascular involvement (MVI) and in healthy controls. We included 36 Behçet's disease patients (22 male, 14 female, mean age: 34.4 +/- 8.3 years) and 20 healthy individuals (14 male, six female, mean age: 31.8 +/- 4.4 years). Whole blood count, CRP and ESR were determined in both groups. Clinical data about the patients were obtained from medical charts. Individuals with hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and smokers were excluded. Behçet's disease patients with MVI were taken as a separate group (8 male, 5 female, mean age: 37 +/- 8 years). MVI was defined as the presence of pulmonary arterial aneurysm, deep venous thrombosis, vena cava inferior or superior thrombosis, or venous sinus thrombosis. Flow cytometry was used to determine platelet-monocyte complexes (PMC), platelet-neutrophil complexes (PNC), basal and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-stimulated platelet CD62P expression. Behçet's disease patients with MVI had significantly higher PNC than Behçet's disease patients without MVI and healthy controls (P values = 0.01). PMC levels in Behçet's disease patients with MVI were significantly higher than in healthy controls (P = 0.01). The groups were similar in basal and ADP-stimulated platelet CD62P expression (P values >0.05). Basal and ADP-stimulated CD62P expression, PMC and PNC were not significantly different between active Behçet's disease versus inactive Behçet's disease patients. The evaluated parameters were similar in Behçet's disease patients with and without uveitis, and pathergy-positive and pathergy-negative groups. Our results might suggest that the formation of PMC and PNC might play a role in thrombosis and MVI of Behçet's disease.
