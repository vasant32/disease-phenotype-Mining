Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is infrequent among cerebrovascular diseases. The simultaneous thrombosis involving both cerebral artery and venous sinus is even extremely rare. We reported a 41-year-old woman who presented with acute headache and left hemiparesis due to concomitant arterial ischemic stroke and recurrent CVT. Extensive investigation disclosed acquired protein C and protein S deficiency, iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and cryoglobulinemia. She was treated with intravenous injection of heparin followed by oral anticoagulant therapy. The headache rapidly subsided; however, left hemiparesis persisted over five months. The rare condition of simultaneous thrombosis of cerebral artery and venous sinus may be caused by the synergistic effect of coagulation disorders, IDA and cryoglobulinemia.
