Although it is rarely seen now, lateral sinus thrombosis may occur in either its septic or aseptic form. Septic lateral sinus thrombosis is a potentially fatal condition in which early diagnosis may be difficult because of previous antibiotic therapy. Once diagnosis is made, combined antibiotic and surgical treatment is necessary to keep the mortality rate at 25%. Aseptic lateral sinus thrombosis is a condition that is rarely fatal but that leads to symptoms of severe headache and visual impairment. The increased intracranial pressure is associated with a blockage of the dominant sinus (usually the right one). The decision to use medical treatment alone or to combine it with surgical treatment must depend on the clinical features of each case.
