Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) associated with minor or trivial head trauma has only been described in a few cases so far. We report two patients who developed CVT after a sudden intracranial pressure increase and head acceleration. A 49-year-old woman jumped from a small rock, 1 m in height, and developed instantaneous occipital headaches. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed confluens sinuum thrombosis. Risk factors consisted of smoking and oral contraceptives. Our second patient, an 18-year-old woman, experienced instantaneous headaches after a sneezing attack. Superior sagittal and right-sided transverse sinus thrombosis were confirmed by venous computed tomography angiography. She took oral contraceptives as an additional risk factor. In about 20% of CVT cases the cause remains unclear. As minor head trauma may not have been recognized during history taking, this may represent a so far under-recognized precipitating factor for CVT.
