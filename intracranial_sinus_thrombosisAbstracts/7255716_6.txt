Three cases of deep cerebral venous thrombosis in children are presented, and the cranial computed tomographic (CT) findings and angiographic findings reviewed. Two patients had findings indicative of brain death at the time of initial CT examination. The third patient recovered without neurological sequelae. Noncontrast-enhanced CT examinations showed abnormally dense-appearing deep venous structures, mimicking a contrast-enhanced study. On the arteriogram the deep venous system failed to opacify, and multiple collaterals to the superficial venous system were formed.
