Thrombosis of the lateral sinus/proximal jugular vein and jugular venous ectasia are infrequent but not uncommon neck masses. Lateral sinus thrombosis was well described in the preantibiotic era, but modern-day surgeons may not be familiar with this entity. Failure to diagnose a neck mass due to jugular vein thrombosis may have deadly consequences. Jugular vein ectasia, which is innocuous, has been mistaken for laryngocele, cystic hygroma, as well as other vascular lesions. However, the management of jugular vein ectasia, which is thought to be caused by incompetence of the bicuspid jugular venous valve, is conservative. We present a case illustrating a neck mass arising from the internal jugular vein with a discussion of jugular venous pathology.
