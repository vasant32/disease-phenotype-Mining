This case report deals with transverse sinus thrombosis accompanied by intracerebellar hemorrhage. A 33-year-old woman had sudden onset of headache, vomiting, and disturbance of consciousness. Computed Tomography (CT) scan showed left intracerebellar hematoma, while vertebral angiography revealed no visualization of the transverse sinus and cerebellar cortical veins on the left side. Evacuation of the intracerebellar hematoma along with decompression of the posterior fossa was carried out. Findings of the histopathological examination of the operation specimen showed the cortical veins to be filled with fresh thrombus and softened cerebellar parenchyma mixed with many small clots. Until now, cases such as hemorrhagic infarction in the cerebellum, due to transverse sinus thrombosis have not yet been reported. It is considered that there is much more collateral circulation in the infratentorial region rather than in the supratentorial region. This indicates that cerebellum hemorrhagic infarction rarely occurs due to transverse sinus thrombosis. In our case, the inflammation of the cortical veins (thrombophlebitis) was thought to have disturbed the collateral circulation in the cerebellum.
