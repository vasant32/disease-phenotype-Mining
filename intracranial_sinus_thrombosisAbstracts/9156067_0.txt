Acute tonsillitis is a common infection of early childhood which may even run a self-limiting course without antibiotic therapy in some cases. Complications are encountered infrequently and rarely assume a life-threatening propensity. Central nervous system involvement has not to our knowledge been described in association with tonsillitis without local abscess formation. We describe three cases in which acute tonsillitis/peritonsillitis was complicated by major central neurological sequelae. The neurological complications encountered in young previously healthy adults were: facial palsy and hemiplegia; superior sagittal sinus thrombosis with communicating hydrocephalus and papilloedema; Guillain-Barr√© syndrome and facial palsy. The pathogenesis and management is discussed. All patients made satisfactory recoveries, though with minor residual neurological disabilities.
