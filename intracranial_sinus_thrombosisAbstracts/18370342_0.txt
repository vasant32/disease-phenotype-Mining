INTRODUCTION: Intracranial hypertension is a picture characterized by elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure that may cause some different complications including optic disc edema and visual accuracy alterations. Although treatment is generally pharmacological, invasive therapeutical techniques such as optic nerve sheath fenestration and lumboperitoneal shunt are sometimes required. The latter one is a technique that usually provides good results with a low complication rate, including infections, mechanical failure and overdrainage. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 40 year-old female patient with an idiopathic intracranial hypertension picture who required a lumboperitoneal shunt due to her progressive deterioration. After a few hours, the patient developed an intracerebral hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage, and some days later she developed a venous sinus thrombosis. These two complications, although described in the literature, are very unusual. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the lumboperitoneal shunt is a safe technique with good results, it is not exempt from complications. We alert about the need to take into account subarachnoid hemorrhage and venous sinus thrombosis as possible complications in the followup of these patients.
