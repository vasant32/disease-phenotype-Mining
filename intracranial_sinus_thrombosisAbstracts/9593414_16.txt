In an earlier comparison1 between women with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) and the female population of the Netherlands, we found that oral contraceptives increased the risk for CVST (age-adjusted odds ratio: 13; 95 percent confidence interval 5&#x2013;37). We now report additional data on the risk of third-generation oral contraceptives. This expression is generally taken to mean combined pills containing either gestodene or desogestrel.We enrolled women aged 18&#x2013;54 with newly diagnosed CVST in a clinical trial between 1992 and 1996. There were 40 cases. Information on use of oral contraceptives at the time of the initial symptoms of CVST was obtained from the patient or nearest relative, supplemented by medical sources. Control data were obtained from prescription information about all women aged 15&#x2013;64 years in a population of 3&#xb7;2 million insured persons in 1994 in the Netherlands.2 We calculated odds ratios as approximations of relative risks, based on the percentage distribution. Because observed odds were compared with population frequencies, we did not calculate confidence intervals, as the size of the control group would make them invariably statistically significant.Of the 40 women, 34 (85%) had been using oral contraceptives at the time of CVST, and 19 of them were on third-generation products (56%). In the control population 38% of those who were on the pill used third-generation contraceptives. This yields an odds ratio for third-generation contraceptives of two to one. For the age categories 15&#x2013;24, 25&#x2013;44, and 45&#x2013;64, the use of third-generation products in the controls was 46%, 34%, and 31%; in the patients it was 60% (6 of 10), 47% (9 of 19), and 80% (4 of 5).Our data on family history of thrombosis were incomplete. If we assume that all patients with a genetic prothombotic abnormality had a positive family history of thrombosis, and re-analyse the data without these patients, this does not change the results. Seven CVST patients had a coagulation abnormality: two of them had used third-generation products, four had taken other oral contraceptives, and one had used none. The results are consistent for all age categories: for all ages, use of third-generation contraceptives was higher among the patients than among controls.We conclude that the increased risk for venous thrombo-embolism in users of third-generation products, compared with other oral contraceptives, recently confirmed by a WHO expert committee,3 is also found for CVST. Since CVST is rare (estimated annual incidence four per million) there is no need for individual women to change their contraceptive, unless additional risk factors for venous thrombosis (such as hereditary clotting disorders or a strong family history) are present.
