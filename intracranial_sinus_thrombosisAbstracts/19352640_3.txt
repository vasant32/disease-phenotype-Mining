INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficiency of the endovascular treatment of transverse-sigmoid sinus dural arteriovenous fistulas (TS_dAVF). METHODS: A total of 150 consecutive patients and 348 procedures were evaluated. RESULTS: Pulsatile tinnitus (81%), headache (15%), and intracranial hemorrhage (10%) were the most frequent manifestations of the TS_dAVFs. More than half of the affected sinuses were partially or completely thrombosed. Access-wise treatment was performed transarterial (n = 33), transvenous (n = 21), or a combination thereof (n = 96). A mean of 2.4 procedures per patient was required. Immediate postprocedural occlusion rate after transarterial embolization was 30% only. Transvenous treatment alone resulted in an early occlusion rate of 81%, with delayed complete obliteration of half of the remaining fistulas. After combined transarterial/transvenous treatment, the angiographic cure rate was 54%. At follow-up, 88% of patients with residual shunt after the treatment showed complete occlusion. The cumulative complication rate was 9% (n = 13), with minor adverse events in ten patients (7%) and major complications in three patients (2%). CONCLUSION: Transvenous coil occlusion of the sinus segment with the adjacent dAVF site, eventually combined with transarterial occlusion of supplying arteries, is a very effective and well-tolerated treatment method. In selected patients, variations of these methods (e.g., sinus stenting, compartmental sinus occlusion) can be useful.
