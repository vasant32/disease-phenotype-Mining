Fast-brain MRI is a promising technique for young children who require anesthesia for conventional MRI; however, poor contrast resolution and the use of one type of pulse sequence only has limitations. We aimed to review and document pitfalls of fast-brain MRI in non-sedated children. Fifty fast-brain MRI studies (Fast Imaging Employing sTeady State Acquistion [FIESTA] protocol; 1.5-Tesla Signa Excite HD, GE HealthCare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) performed between January 2008 and August 2010 in 30 non-sedated patients aged 1day to 5years of age (mean: 18months) were reviewed retrospectively and compared to the most recent MRI or CT scan. The indications were: ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt insertion or revision or follow-up (20/50, 40%), postoperative follow-up (9/50, 18%), macrocephaly, ventriculomegaly or congenital malformation (15/50, 30%), complications of prematurity (6/50, 12%). The VP shunt position and size of fluid-filled structures were satisfactorily assessed in all patients. Undetected findings in 7/50 studies (14%) were: venous sinus thrombosis (one patient), subdural hematoma (three), failure to differentiate blood products (two), and limited evaluation of extra-axial collections (one). FIESTA fast-brain MRI provides satisfactory assessment of shunt position and the size of fluid-filled structures, but radiologists should be aware of limitations for depiction of venous sinus thrombosis, and bleeding. Modification of fast-brain protocols appears to be indicated.
