On the basis of 29 cases of meningo-cephalic complications of sinusitis, the authors evaluate the following ; the type of sinusitis responsible, emphasising the fact that in contrast to classical concept maxillary sinusitis was responsible equally as often as frontal sinusitis. Amongst abcesses, the predominant cause is the streptococcus. Cases of meningitis are dominated by the pneumococcus, which cases obviously the gravest bacteriological aetiology. Finally, amongst the 3 cases of thrombophlebitis reported, there were two blood cultures positive for staphylococci. In the light of these bacteriological data, the authors emphasise the need for appropriate antibiotic therapy in acute and chronic sinusitis.
