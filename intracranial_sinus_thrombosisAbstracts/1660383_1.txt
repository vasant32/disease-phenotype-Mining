Hypopituitarism related to cavernous sinus thrombosis is a very rare event which usually occurs at least 1 year after the acute stage. We report a case which distinguished itself from the previously reported cases through (i) its occurrence during the acute stage and (ii) its total recovery within 1 year. Early anterior hypopituitarism is probably more frequent than expected on the basis of reported cases and it may contribute to the high rate of mortality in cavernous sinus thrombosis. This underscores the need to consider hypopituitarism in every patient with cavernous sinus thrombosis.
