Dural puncture with corticosteroid could be a predisposing factor for cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). A 35-year-old woman using oral contraception was treated with corticosteroid epidural infiltration for L5 radiculalgia. The following day a postural headache developed and accidental dural puncture was suspected. Four days later, she presented with fever and consciousness impairment requiring mechanical ventilation. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) confirmed thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus. Recanalization was observed three weeks later and the patient fully recovered. Blood tests for thrombophilia showed a moderate decrease in the C protein level (chronometric activity 44%, N = 65-130). CVT has been reported after spinal anaesthesia or peridural anaesthesia with accidental puncture. After dural puncture the decrease of cerebrospinal fluid pressure induces a rostrocaudal sagging effect with traumatic damage to the fragile venous endothelial wall, and may trigger a venous vasodilatation with resultant stasis. CVT has also been described in patients after lumbar puncture and oral corticoid treatment for multiple sclerosis and after corticosteroid intrathecal infiltration. Therefore, corticosteroids can be considered as a potential additional procoagulant stimuli.
