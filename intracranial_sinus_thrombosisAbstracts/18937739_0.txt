Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) is associated with anaemia, intravascular haemolysis and venous thrombosis. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a late but serious complication of PNH. We for the first time report a young man who presented with CVST and was diagnosed to have PNH after 11 months. We highlight the reasons for delay in the diagnosis and discuss the special issues in the management.
