Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is an important cause of stroke in young population. A thorough understanding of its pathophysiology, clinical, and radiological features is needed for an early and timely diagnosis to initiate appropriate treatment before the disease becomes worse and difficult to manage. In this study, the recent advances in the therapeutics of cerebral venous thrombosis with brief overview of epidemiology, clinical features, and imaging modalities were reviewed. With emerging imaging modalities and therapeutic options, there has been a progress in ease of ability to diagnose and treat cerebral venous thrombosis, but because of the lack of a much-needed randomized controlled trial, there is deficiency of a standardized algorithm/protocol for treatment of cerebral sinus thrombosis, which remains mostly at the discretion of experiences of treating physicians. In this study, the presently available treatment and diagnostic modalities with pros and cons of each of them were reviewed.
