A congenital cholesteatoma or epidermoid is a benign mass that causes devastating effects if left untreated. An unusual case with a congenital cholesteatoma located in the mastoid region complicated by epidural abscess, sinus thrombosis, and cutaneous fistula is presented. The patient had normal otologic findings and had no neurologic deficit. A review of the literature found no report of a similar case.
