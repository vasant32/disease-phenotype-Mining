We report a case of simultaneous presentation of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and thyrotoxicosis in a 28 year-old female subsequently found to have the Factor V Leiden mutation. She made an excellent neurological recovery with anticoagulation. The mode of presentation of the case was surprising, as she had no thrombotic episodes in two previous pregnancies. This suggests that thyrotoxicosis may give rise to a hypercoagulable state.
