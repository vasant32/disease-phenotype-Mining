A case of complete thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus in a pregnant women with multiple haemorrhages and hydrocephalus is described. Due to acute onset and progressive neurological deterioration, the decision was taken to remove the clot surgically. A sinotomy was performed removing the thrombotic material followed by local infusion of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). The combination of surgical removal and thrombolysis was life-saving for this young patient.
