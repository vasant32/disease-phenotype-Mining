Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is a rare but dangerous condition, occurring with an incidence of 3-4 cases/million/year. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis presents a diagnostic challenge due to its varied presentation patterns. We report a case of a 42 year old Nepali man diagnosed with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis after presenting with a week long history of continuous headache. He improved rapidly following prompt anticoagulation. Despite thorough investigation no discernable underlying cause could be found. Our report highlights the value of prompt diagnosis of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis through neuroimaging and the importance of immediate anticoagulation as part of patient management.
