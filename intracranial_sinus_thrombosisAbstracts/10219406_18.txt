Thrombosis of the dural venous sinuses is a potentially lethal condition that remains a diagnostic dilemma. Clinical outcome is typically dependent on the timeliness of diagnosis and definitive treatment. We report a case of successful rapid thrombectomy of extensive thrombus within the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses using a rheolytic catheter device. This appears to be a promising treatment option, particularly in those patients who do not respond to other, more established, forms of therapy.
