Acquired or hereditary prothrombotic risk factors may lead to cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), particularly when other predisposing factors coexist. A 57-year-old man experienced right leg deep venous thrombosis, severe thrombosis of the haemorrhoid plexus and CVST over a 12-month period during which he was taking sildenafil regularly twice a week. Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5)-inhibitor used for erectile dysfunction (ED). A slight reduction in antithrombin III and free protein S levels was demonstrated. After suspension of sildenafil and six months on oral anticoagulants, clinical improvement was obtained. Recurrent venous thrombosis, including CVST, may complicate prolonged treatment with PDE5-inhibitors in subjects at risk. Periodic monitoring of clotting factors is recommended in these subjects.
