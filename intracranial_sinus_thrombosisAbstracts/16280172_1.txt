We report about a boy with the symptoms of Gradenigo's syndrome (abducens nerve palsy, acute otitis media, unilateral headache). The MR imaging showed a sinus vein thrombosis instead of the expected petroapicitis. After 2 weeks of conservative therapy with antibiotics and anticoagulation, without any clinical effort the boy underwent a mastoidectomy. Headache and otitis media recovered quickly but the diplopia still remained after 25 months.
