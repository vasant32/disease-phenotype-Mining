This article summarizes recent developments in the growing field of interventional neuroradiology for the treatment of acute cerebrovascular disease. We describe the possibilities in endovascular therapy of acute cerebral aneurysms using electrolytically detachable coils combined with trispan neck bridging devices and stent implantation to occlude acute wide neck aneurysms. Techniques and results of local intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy in acute stroke and central retinal artery occlusion are described and we discuss the potential for rapid, large-burden thrombus removal in cases of internal carotid artery thrombosis by rheolytic thrombectomy, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent implantation. Emergency endovascular therapy using the transvenous approach to treat severe intracranial or intraocular hypertension and multifocal haemorrhagic venous infarction due to cerebral sinus thrombosis or dural fistulas is also described. In cases of acute bleeding of head and neck lesions following trauma, tumours after radiotherapy, arteriovenous malformations, epistaxis or from iatrogenic origin, angiography plays a major role in localizing the source of bleeding and occluding the damaged vessel during the same session using the same endovascular approach.
