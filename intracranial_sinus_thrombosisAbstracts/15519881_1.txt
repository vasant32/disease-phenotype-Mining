Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVT) after mild head injury is infrequent. A 38-year-old patient presented with a Glasgow Coma score (GCS) of 15 after a road traffic accident. CT scan revealed a temporal contusion. He was treated with measures to prevent cerebral oedema and anticonvulsants. Three weeks later he presented with features of pseudo-tumour syndrome. Investigations revealed the presence of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, protein C deficiency and elevated titres of antiphospholipid antibodies. He was treated with anticoagulants and showed improvement. This case report highlights that multiple "hits" may lead to CVT and hence laboratory screening of patients with CVT is necessary even if the clinical situation seemingly provides sufficient explanation for a thrombotic event. The presence of acquired and inherited causes of thrombophilia need not always lead to symptomatic thrombosis. As illustrated by this case, a second hit, such as trauma, may be the precipitating factor that unmasks the prothrombotic state.
