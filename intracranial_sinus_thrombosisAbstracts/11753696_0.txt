CASE REPORT: A 14 year old patient showing bilateral frontal headache during the previous four months was studied. Ophtalmoscopic examination revealed presence of bilateral papilledema. Magnetic resonance angiography showed presence of thrombosis in upper sagital and transverse sinuses. Patient was treated with oral acetazolamide (500 mg a day), one month later, headhache had disappeared and papilledema decreased. DISCUSSION: Aseptic cerebral venus thrombosis is an infrecuent condition that often is cause of neurologic complications that may become severe. Treatment should aim at decreasing intracranial pressure in order to avoid optic nerve atrophy and visual loss.
