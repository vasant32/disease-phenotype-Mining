PURPOSE: To describe bilateral blindness resulting from infection with community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). DESIGN: Observational case report. METHODS: A 44-year-old man developed proptosis, ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and no light perception vision after attempting to lance a nasal pustule. A nasal culture grew MRSA. Imaging showed bilateral orbital cellulitis, pansinusitis, and cavernous sinus thrombosis. The right fundus showed severe ischemia, but the left fundus was essentially normal. RESULTS: Despite initiation of appropriate antibiotics early in the course of infection, the patient lost sight in both eyes. Surgical drainage of the paranasal sinuses and use of intravenous corticosteroids and heparin led to the resolution of orbital cellulitis. CONCLUSIONS: MRSA orbital cellulitis can progress to irreversible blindness despite antibiotic treatment. A new, community-acquired clone of this organism has exhibited increased potential for tissue invasion.
