A 13-year-old boy had a history of severe headache for two weeks. He also had seizures and vomited many times. Neurological examination was normal except for bilateral papilloedema. Sagittal T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images showed loss of the normal flow void in the superior sagittal sinus. There was hyperintensity, which came from subacute thrombosis in the posterior half of the superior sagittal sinus. MR venography confirmed loss of flow signal in the superior sagittal sinus. There was also thrombosis of the right transverse, right sigmoid, and left transverse sinuses, and haemorrhagic infarctions in the right frontal and left parietal regions. A diagnosis of dural sinus thrombosis with cerebral venous infarction was made. CT, MR imaging, MR venography, and CT venography findings are discussed in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis.
