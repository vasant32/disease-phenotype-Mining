We report clinical findings, risk factors and neurological and cognitive long-term outcome in three Italian children aged 7, 8 and 5, respectively, who experienced cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). All children presented with headache, associated to nausea, vomiting and papilloedema. None suffered from epileptic seizures. In two of them a paresis of the sixth cranial nerve with diplopia was found. Diagnosis was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging angiography (angio MRI) in all cases. In all patients plasma levels of protein C, protein S, antithrombin III (AT III), antiphospholipid antibodies (ApA) and homocysteine were detected. Furthermore, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin mutation G20210A and MTHFR mutation were searched for. A Protein C reduction was detected in all patients at onset; this finding, however, was not confirmed at follow-up in all of them. At one-year follow-up, neurological examination was normal in all children and neuropsychological assessment, aimed at excluding linguistic and non-linguistic cognitive deficits, revealed normal performances in two of them. In the third child, cognitive assessment confirmed a previously diagnosed developmental dyslexia.
