Currently, the combination of T1- and T2-weighted spin echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences with MR venography is considered the best diagnostic tool for diagnosing cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), because they allow positive identification of the thrombotic clot along with the disturbed venous flow signal. We report two patients in whom initial MRI with the mentioned techniques did not show a clot signal. In both patients anticoagulation was started despit lacking proof of CVT by imaging and both patients improved. Only on repeated MRI sinus clot signal could be confirmed.
