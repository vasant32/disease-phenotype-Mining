The genotype-phenotype relationship of compound heterozygous protein S-deficiency in a 7-year-old girl with reduced protein S-levels and a severe cerebral sinovenous thrombosis is illustrated. In this patient we identified a novel deletion in the protein S-gene causing a compound heterozygous state and subsequently a symptomatic protein S-deficiency. In case of thrombosis analysis of protein S is recommended. Low levels of protein S should be further investigated by molecular diagnostics.
