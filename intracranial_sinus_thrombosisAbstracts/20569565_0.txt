Summary: Patients with acute cerebral venous sinus thrombosis treated with Heparin or in situ thrombolysis in our department were evaluated in an attempt to rationalize treatment with heparin or thrombolysis. 279 patients with angiographically proven acute cerebral venous sinus thrombosis were included in the study. Patients were classified into mild and severe clinical grade. The study was divided into three phases. Phase I included 27 patients treated with systemic heparin. Phase II included 72 patients, 30 in severe grade and 42 in mild. 26 were thrombolysed with 14 in severe and 12 in mild grade. Phase III included 180 patients treated according to a defined protocol. 133 were in mild grade and 47 in severe. 67 patients were thrombolysed. In the thrombolysed group 27 patients were in mild grade and 40 in severe. 113 patients were treated with systemic heparin. Following acute management all were anticoagulated for six months. The baseline characteristics were found to be same in all three phases. On comparison of outcome in Phase III with Phase 1 the likelihood ratio was found to be statistically significant in favor of Phase III (p<0.0001). The likelihood ratio was found to be statistically significant in mild and severe clinical grade in favor of thrombolysis in Phase III (p 0.039 in mild and p 0.00001 in Severe clinical grade). This ratio was insignificant (p=0.716) for intracranial bleed; however, local puncture site bleeding was found to be significant in the thrombolysed group (0.00005).
