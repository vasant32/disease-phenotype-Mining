OBJECTIVE: Determination of characteristic signs for the early diagnosis of neuro-otological complications of otitis media. DESIGN: Retrospective. SETTING: University Hospital Groningen, the Netherlands. METHOD: The medical histories of 11 patients with neuro-otological complications of otitis media were analysed. The time interval between the first manifestation of symptoms related to the complication and the start of correct therapy was established. RESULTS: In 10 of the 11 patients persistent fever and (or) headache were manifest as early symptoms. More severe morbidity was correlated with an increased time interval between the early symptoms and the start of treatment. Doctor's delay was regarded as the most significant delaying factor. CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis of neuro-otological complications of otitis media based on the early symptoms persistent fever and headache can reduce morbidity and mortality.
