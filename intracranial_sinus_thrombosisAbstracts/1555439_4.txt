We report the rare occurrence of fatal cardiac tamponade due to coronary sinus and right atrial thrombosis associated with central venous catheterization. The clinical course was extremely rapid, with death occurring a few minutes after the acute clinical event. Other causes of acute cardiac tamponade were ruled out by the postmortem studies.
