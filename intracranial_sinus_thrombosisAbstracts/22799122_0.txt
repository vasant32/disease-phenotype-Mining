A 17 year old male presented with seizures, headache, and fever and left chronic suppurative otitis media. A 35 year old male presented with headache, giddiness, vomiting, pain in eyes, diplopia and right chronic suppurative otitis media. Brain imaging in both revealed thrombosis of lateral and sigmoid sinus and also of internal jugular vein on the left and right side respectively. A diagnosis of Lemierre's syndrome was made in both. They were treated with antibiotics and anticoagulants, and they responded to treatment. We want to report this case as we feel, that with the advent of the antibiotic era, this syndrome has become rare; and so "quite forgotten" or overlooked, by many physicians.
