Radiographic signs of cavernous sinus thrombosis were found in eight consecutive patients with an angiographic diagnosis of carotid-cavernous sinus fistula; six were of the dural type and the ninth case was of a shunt from a cerebral hemisphere vascular malformation. Diagnostic features consisted of filling defects within the cavernous sinus and its tributaries, an abnormal shape of the cavernous sinus, an atypical pattern of venous drainage, and venous stasis. Progression of thrombosis was demonstrated in five patients who underwent follow-up angiography. Because of a high incidence of spontaneous resolution, patients with dural-cavernous sinus fistulas who show signs of venous thrombosis at angiography should be followed conservatively.
