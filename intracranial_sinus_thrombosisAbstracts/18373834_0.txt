Distant cutaneous metastases from cervical malignancies are uncommon, with scalp metastases being exceptional events. We present the case of a 53-year-old postmenopausal lady with adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix that metastasized to the scalp with superior sagittal sinus thrombosis 8 months after diagnosis. In contrast to the seven prior cases of scalp metastases of cervical squamous cell carcinoma reported in published reports, ours is the first documentation of such an occurrence in cervical adenocarcinoma. Superior sagittal sinus thrombosis has not been reported with this tumour in the past.
