A 73-year-old female was admitted to our hospital because of disturbed consciousness and left-sided motor weakness. Computed tomographic scans demonstrated a hemorrhagic infarction in the right parietal region. Right carotid angiograms showed both the posterior portion of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and the entire left transverse sinus simultaneously occluded. Left carotid angiograms revealed an enlarged occipital artery, which had direct communications to the left sigmoid sinus and the superior petrosal sinus. These findings were consistent with dural arteriovenous fistula (D-AVF). The laboratory examinations yieled normal results. The patient was managed conservatively with glyceol and anticonvulsants for four weeks and eventually recovered with complete resolution of hemiparesis. Follow-up angiography carried out 6 weeks later showed the SSS, partially stenotic, but recanalized with no evidence of venous congestion. The D-AVF still remained opacified, but there was a marked reduction in retrograde flow to the sigmoid sinus. Further repeated angiograms obtained at 10 months after the onset confirmed complete recanalization of the SSS and disappearance of the D-AVF. From the timing of the angiographies, we considered that the sinus occlusion was caused by the high arterial flow to the fistula and its disappearance made recanalization of SSS possible.
