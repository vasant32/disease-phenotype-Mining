Acute otitis media complications are relative rare since the introduction of antibiotics. Still many controversies exist on the diagnosis and treatment of some of them. In this report we describe a pediatric case of upper cervical abscess (bezold abscess), sigmoid sinus thrombosis and occipital osteomyelitis following mastoiditis, presenting with persistent fever and otorrhea. The patient responded well to intravenous antibiotics and wall-intact mastoidectomy. We discuss methods of early diagnosis and appropriate treatment options.
