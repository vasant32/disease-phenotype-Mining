BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Inherited protein S deficiency has been associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic disease. It is possible that such a coagulopathy could predispose children to the development of strokes by permitting clot formation in response to stimuli that ordinarily would be insufficient to cause thrombus formation. CASE DESCRIPTION: We evaluated a previously well 4-year-old boy who developed cerebral venous thrombosis after suffering minor head trauma. Crossed-immunoelectrophoresis of his plasma showed a marked decrease of the free, active form of protein S. Family studies revealed that the patient's father and other paternal relatives had a similar abnormality of protein S. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the cerebral venous thrombosis in this child was initially precipitated by minor head trauma and pathological thrombus formation was then potentiated by inherited protein S deficiency. This case extends the clinical spectrum for protein S deficiency and emphasizes the importance of evaluating family members to establish a specific diagnosis and therapeutic intervention.
