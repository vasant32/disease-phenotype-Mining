For 150 years, the variable clinical appearance of dural sinus thrombosis has plagued clinicians. Computed tomography (CT) has alleviated much of the difficulty in making this diagnosis. A high density lesion in the involved sinus on precontrast scans and a filling defect in the sinus on postcontrast scans were the most frequently observed CT abnormalities in 12 patients with sinus thrombosis. Other findings include the "cord" sign and diffuse cerebral edema. Thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus, transverse sinus, or sigmoid sinus can occur as an isolated event or in association with other disease entities and may cause no neurologic impairment.
