Two patients with unilateral painful ophthalmoplegia are presented, a woman of 26 and a man of 28. In both cases the phlebography of the orbit shows an alteration of the orbital veinous blood flow, specially of the third segment of the superior orbital vein. Another characteristic feature of this syndrom is efficiency of corticotherapy and heparinotherapy, which may suggest an inflammatory and thrombophlebitic origin.
