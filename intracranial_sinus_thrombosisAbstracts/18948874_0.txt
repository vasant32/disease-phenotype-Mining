Despite appropriate treatment, surgery for aortic dissection is frequently associated with bleeding problems. In these series we report on the employment of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) for refractory hemorrhage after emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection, used to face the problems of postoperative blood loss and transfusion requirements. Despite the good results of the therapy, a patient presented with thrombosis of the left cavernous sinus. Although a risk of thromboembolic complications has to be considered, rFVIIa is a reasonable rescue option in life-threatening hemorrhage and enlarges our hemostatic armamentarium in surgery for acute aortic dissection.
