A 59-year-old female was hospitalized because of disturbance of consciousness and convulsive seizures. She had taken a hormonal drug for 15 months after breast cancer surgery. A computed tomography scan revealed multiple high-density areas in the left temporal and frontal and the right parietal lobes. Angiography showed a dural arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the posterior fossa fed by the occipital and the middle meningeal arteries and draining into the transverse sinus. It also demonstrated occlusion of the left sigmoid sinus in the venous phase. She complained of headache in the occipital region and dizziness. On day 13, the left occipital artery was ligated and cut, and then abnormal arterial anastomoses around the lesion were coagulated. After surgery, clinical symptoms disappeared. The etiology of dural AVM is controversial, but in this case it is suspected that sinus thrombosis due to the drug caused the dural AVM. The authors discuss the etiology and treatment of dural AVM in the posterior fossa.
