A 35-year-old healthy male with no history of any past medical illness developed severe headache, vomiting and drowsiness while at high altitude (4,572 m) in the eastern Himalayan ranges. He was evacuated to a tertiary-care hospital where he was diagnosed to have cerebral sinus venous thrombosis (CSVT) on magnetic resonance imaging, with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of his right popliteo-femoral vein on color Doppler study. Investigation for thrombophilia revealed protein S (PS) deficiency in this patient. Family screening revealed low levels of PS in two elder brothers. One brother had a history of 'stroke in young' at the age of 20 years with the other being asymptomatic. This established the hereditary nature of PS deficiency. We are not aware of any previously published report on hereditary PS deficiency combined with CSVT and DVT occurring at high altitude. However, 1 case of protein C deficiency with CSVT has been reported previously.
