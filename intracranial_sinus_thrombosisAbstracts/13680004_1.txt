We describe the MRI features of sigmoid sinus thrombosis following mastoiditis in a 3-year-old girl. The features consisted of increased signal from the sinus on T2-weighted images and absence of flow on MR venography. It is concluded that MRI enabled a timely diagnosis of this life-threatening disease. MRI, as a non-invasive technique that does not use ionizing radiation, should be considered the investigation of first choice, especially in young patients.
