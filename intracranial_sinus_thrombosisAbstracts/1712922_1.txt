The authors report a rare case of dural arteriovenous malformation (AVM) associated with occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus. A 78-year-old female developed transient aphasia, followed by generalized convulsion. Common carotid angiography showed a dural AVM fed by the bilateral middle meningeal arteries, draining to the superior sagittal sinus, and sinus occlusion. 123I-single photon emission computed tomography demonstrated decreased blood flow in the bifrontal-parasagittal regions. Transcatheter embolization via the feeding arteries improved the cerebral blood flow around the lesion, and the symptoms disappeared.
