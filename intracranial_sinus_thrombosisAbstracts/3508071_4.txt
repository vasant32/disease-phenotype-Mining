Intracranial venous thrombosis has been described in newborns, but there have been no reports of intractable neonatal seizures due to this condition. We report cortical venous sinus thrombosis in two term neonates who presented with seizures in the first 24 hours of life. The diagnosis was made by cranial computed tomography and was confirmed by cerebral angiography. Both patients improved clinically after the intracranial venous thrombosis resolved. These patients demonstrate that intracranial venous thrombosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neonatal seizures.
