Two cases of lateral sinus thrombosis in fit adults with no previous otological history are presented. One case occurred in association with Bezold's abscess and followed mastoiditis which was masked by previous antibiotic treatment. The other case occurred in association with an occipitoparietal scalp abscess and there was no obvious preceding middle ear infection. The causative bacteria were Streptococcus milleri and a variant Streptococcus intermedius. Lateral sinus thrombosis is discussed.
