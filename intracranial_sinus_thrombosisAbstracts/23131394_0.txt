 OBJECTIVE: To explore and evaluate the efficacy of intrasinus thrombolysis (IST) in patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) during postpartum period. METHODS: 11 patients during postpartum period with CVST who received IST during July 2007-November 2011 were included. Urokinase was infused into the sinuses via a microcatheter. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) was performed to assess the recanalization of venous sinuses. RESULTS: Before discharge, the intracranial pressure in 11 patients was under 200 mmH(2)O. MRV confirmed that venous sinus of 9 patients were smooth. The cortex venous and deep venous recovered to normal. Venous sinus of 2 patients recanalized partly, and cortex venous and deep venous had compensation. 9 patients had good outcome and 2 patients had only mild deficits. CONCLUSION: Intrasinus thrombolysis is safe and effective in patients with severe cerebral venous sinus thrombosis during postpartum period.
