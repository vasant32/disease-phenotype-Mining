BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Outcome from sinus vein thrombosis is very variable, with symptoms from headache to coma. Experimental findings suggest that an involvement of cortical veins is necessary to affect the cerebral microcirculation. Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to investigate the regional and temporal changes in local cortical blood flow after experimental occlusion and thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus and tributary cortical veins in rats. METHODS: Thrombosis was induced by slow injection of kaolin-cephalin suspension after frontal and caudal ligation of the sagittal sinus in rats. Local cerebral blood flow was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry and correlated with parenchymal damage found 24 hours after induction of thrombosis. RESULTS: Local cerebral blood flow 1 hour after sinus occlusion and induction of thrombosis had decreased to 60.92 +/- 29.05% (p < 0.01); however, there was a large variability among individual animals. Only five of 12 rats showed histological damage and intracerebral hemorrhages 24 hours after induction of thrombosis. A subgroup analysis revealed that parenchymal damage occurred in concurrence with reduced blood flow values after sinus ligation and injection of the thrombogenic material. Sinus thrombosis alone, without alteration of blood flow, did not cause tissue necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: The data support the contention that sinus vein thrombosis evolves gradually, with major symptoms occurring only if the thrombus expands from the sinus into bridging and cortical veins. Collateral venous outflow pathways are thereby occluded, and local blood flow may become reduced to and below the ischemic threshold.
