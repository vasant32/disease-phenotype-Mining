In January, 1995, a 64-year-old man became dizzy and vomited for several hours. 48 h later he was drowsy, confused, and dysphasic. His pulse was 80/min and regular; blood pressure 220/110 mm&#xa0;Hg. He had small equal pupils, no nystagmus or neck stiffness, diminished power in the right arm and leg with increased tone, and some right ankle clonus. He then had generalised seizures. His previous medical history was unremarkable. Urea (8&#xb7;7 mmol/L), glucose (8&#xb7;2 mmol/L), and creatine kinase (853 U/L) were elevated. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 22 mm/h. A computed tomography (CT) brain scan on admission (figure) was interpreted as showing a primary intracerebral haemorrhage in the left temporoparietal region. Neurosurgeons and neuroradiologists thought the scan showed haemorrhagic transformation of a large arterial infarct in the middle cerebral artery territory. He died 8 h later. Necropsy showed cardiomegaly, symmetrical left-ventricular hypertrophy, and a fenestrated patent foramen ovale. Histologically verified ante-mortem thrombus was present in right and left atria, adding to the clinical interpretation that the brain lesion had resulted from an arterial embolus.
