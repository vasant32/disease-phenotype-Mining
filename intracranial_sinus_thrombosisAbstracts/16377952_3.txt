A 55-year-old woman presented with consciousness disorders. Computed tomography revealed hemorrhage in the left temporoparietal region. The angiographic diagnosis was progressive sinus thrombosis from the superior sagittal sinus to the bilateral transverse sinuses. Her condition deteriorated despite heparin administration. Therefore, mechanical thrombolysis was performed for sinus thrombosis using a balloon catheter, in addition to supportive thrombolytic therapy with urokinase, resulting in sinus patency. Mechanical thrombolysis is an effective therapeutic modality for sinus thrombosis refractory to heparin administration.
