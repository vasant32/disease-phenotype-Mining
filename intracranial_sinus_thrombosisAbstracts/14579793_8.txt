Cranial dural arteriovenous fistulae (DAVF) may occur post-traumatic or sporadic. The physiopathologic mechanisms of sporadic DAVF are still unclear. A dural sinus thrombosis followed by an increase in venous pressure and/or an increased procoagulatory activity of the coagulation system are associated at least with some DAVF. The objective of this study was to investigate the coagulation profile in patients with DAVF. Thus the association of thrombophilic abnormalities, sinus thrombosis and DAVF should be analyzed. A total of 15 patients with cranial DAVF were included in this study. Blood samples were analyzed for 20210A mutation of the prothrombin gene, resistance to activated protein C and factor V Leiden mutation. Fibrinogen (Fib), Textarin time (TT), antithrombin (AT), protein C and protein S activity, von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag), Ristocetin cofactor activity (vWF:RCo), D-Dimer (DD) and coagulation factor VIII-activity (F VIII) were determined in all patients. Blood was screened for the occurrence of lupus antiphospholipid antibodies and cardiolipin antibodies. Thrombophilic risk factors were found in 5 (33%) of the 15 patients with cranial DAVF. Four patients had a heterozygote 20210A mutation of the prothrombin gene and one patient had a heterozygote FV Leiden mutation. Sinus thrombosis was detected in two patients with grade 2b DAVF and was associated with a 20210A mutation of the prothrombin gene in both patients. Additionally, one patient had deficient protein C activity and screening for cardiolipin antibodies was positive in three patients. In the current series the frequency of prothrombin Gene 20210A mutation was higher in patients with DAVF compared to the general population, whereas the incidence of Factor V Leiden mutation was not. Therefore in patients with cranial DAVF thrombophilic abnormalities should be considered in the post-operative/post-interventional management.
