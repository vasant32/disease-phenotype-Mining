Cerebral sinus and venous thrombosis were diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) and subsequently confirmed by other studies in eleven patients. CT revealed normal or small ventricles, hemorrhages, low-density areas, and increased density of dural sinuses and tentorium. CT in combination with appropriate angiographic studies is necessary for diagnosis and confirmation of sinus and venous thrombosis. Proper use of CT can result in decreased morbidity and mortality associated with this condition.
