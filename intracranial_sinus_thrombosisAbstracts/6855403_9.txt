Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a serious life threatening condition which usually results from midfacial skin infections. Preantibiotic era mortality rates of 80% have improved markedly because of an early awareness of the condition and prompt initiation of parenteral antibiotics. Sphenoid sinusitis is an uncommon associated cause of cavernous sinus infection and is itself a rare and elusive clinical problem. A case of sphenoid sinusitis and concurrent cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis is presented to highlight the clinical diagnostic considerations with special emphasis on bilateral eye signs as indicators of the impending thrombophlebitic process.
