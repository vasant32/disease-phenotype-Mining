PURPOSE: We report on our first experience in imaging the cerebral veins and sinuses with CT angiography (CTA). MATERIAL AND METHODS: CTA was performed in 10 patients after bolus injection of contrast medium to rule out sinus thrombosis. RESULTS: In 8 of 10 patients thrombosis of cerebral venous sinuses was ruled out by CTA. Sinus thrombosis was diagnosed and confirmed in two patients. In 5 cases, diagnosis of CTA was confirmed by MRI and/or DSA, in 5 other cases by the clinical course. CTA results in detailed information about flow and anatomy of cerebral veins due to high intravascular contrast. CONCLUSIONS: CTA is a suitable noninvasive method to study cerebral veins as it is superior to conventional CT because of high resolution and intravascular contrast. To assess the sensitivity of CTA for diagnosis of venous sinus thrombosis a prospective study is needed.
