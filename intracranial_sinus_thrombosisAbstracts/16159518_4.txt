Arterial ischemic stroke is approximately four times more prevalent than sinovenous thrombosis and has been associated with a worse neurologic outcome than sinovenous thrombosis; however, no data are available comparing intellectual outcome after pediatric arterial ischemic stroke and sinovenous thrombosis. We report the short-term intellectual outcome (mean 5.8 months since stroke) in a sample of 72 children, 47 with arterial ischemic stroke, and 25 with sinovenous thrombosis. Intellectual outcome measures were the Full-Scale IQ of the age-appropriate Wechsler intelligence test for older children and the Mental Developmental Index of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development for younger children. Stroke type did not directly influence intellectual outcome. Intellectual outcome was in the normal range whether the children had suffered an arterial ischemic stroke or a sinovenous thrombosis.
