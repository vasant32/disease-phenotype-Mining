A 19-year-old man with severe active ulcerative colitis was admitted to our hospital where he was prescribed 80 mg prednisolone and underwent leukocytapheresis (LCAP). Two weeks after initiating therapy, his symptoms had not recovered. We administered cyclosporin via continuous intravenous infusion for 12 days. Although his clinical symptoms improved, he complained of severe headache. Immediate plain computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging angiography (MRA) revealed extensive thrombosis in the superior sagittal sinus and right transverse sinus. We treated this condition with the anticoagulant agent, heparin, which prevents and can treat venous thrombosis. We report an occurrence of cerebral sinus thrombosis accompanying ulcerative colitis, where active anticoagulant therapy was useful.
