Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with the occurrence of thrombotic complications. They rarely involve cerebrovascular events, manifesting as arterial ischemic strokes or venous thrombosis, more often in patients with ulcerative colitis than Crohn's disease. Pathogenesis of hypercoagulability in IBD contributing to thromboembolic events is not well known. We present a 31-year old man with Crohn's disease complicated with the transverse and sigmoid sinus thrombosis and secondary intracerebral hemorrhage, confirmed in magnetic resonance imaging. Thrombotic complication occurred during the active phase of the disease and treatment with steroids.
