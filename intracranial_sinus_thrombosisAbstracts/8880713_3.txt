A young man developed intracranial hypertension immediately after myelography with non-ionic water-soluble contrast medium (iopamidol). Cerebral angiography showed extensive cerebral venous thrombosis. The common causes of thrombophlebitis were excluded. A relationship to the contrast medium was strongly suspected, since a similar case has been reported. The rheological properties and haemo-concentration induced by iopamidol could explain this complication.
