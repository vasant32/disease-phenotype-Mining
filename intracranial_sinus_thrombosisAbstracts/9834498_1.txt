We report a case of dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) of the transverse and sigmoid sinus which developed over five years. The patient was a 64-year-old man, who had a history of congestive heart failure and transient ischemic attack (TIA). No abnormal lesions were detected in the cerebral angiograms five years prior to the time the etiology of his TIA was investigated. He suddenly suffered from left hemiparesis and the CT scan showed right parietal subcortical hemorrhage. Right carotid angiogram demonstrated dAVF of the transverse and sigmoid sinus supplied by the right occipital and ascending pharyngeal arteries. We thought the reason for the subcortical hemorrhage in this patient was due to the disturbance of venous return in the right cerebral hemisphere. We underwent direct embolization of the right transverse sinus by interlocking detachable coils. Postoperative cerebral angiograms demonstrated the disappearance of dAVF and he was discharged. Whether dAVF is a congenital anomaly or not, has been controversial. Since the dAVF in this case had newly developed over five years, it is suggested that dAVF is an acquired lesion.
