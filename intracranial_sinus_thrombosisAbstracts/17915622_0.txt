Although venous thrombosis is a major complication in nephrotic syndrome, cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is rarely reported. We describe a 29-year-old male with nephrotic syndrome who suddenly developed headache and nausea. Although computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging detected no abnormal lesions, phase-contrast magnetic resonance venography (PC MRV) demonstrated extensive thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus. After receiving systemic anticoagulant therapy and oral prednisolone, his neurological symptoms improved dramatically, and complete remission from nephrotic syndrome was achieved. Follow-up PC MRV demonstrated recanalization of the superior sagittal sinus, and renal biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of minimal change nephrotic syndrome. Although CVT is difficult to detect with conventional diagnostic methods, PC MRV may help the establishment of an early diagnosis and prompt treatment for a successful outcome.
