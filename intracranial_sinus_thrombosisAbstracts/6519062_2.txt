This paper describes the CT findings in five cases of cerebral and cerebellar sinovenous occlusion. Characteristic CT findings are the visualisation of the thrombosed sinuses and veins, known as the "filled triangle" and the "cord sign" on the control scan, and the "empty triangle" with tentorial and gyral enhancement after contrast enhancement. The high incidence of thrombosed internal cerebral veins and superior cerebellar veins with sinus thrombosis in children is remarkable. CT with both control and contrast enhanced scans will probably provide the correct diagnosis in the majority of cases.
