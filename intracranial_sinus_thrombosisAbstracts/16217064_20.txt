BACKGROUND: Bilateral transverse sinus (TS) stenosis has been found in more than 90% of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether TS stenosis changed after normalization of CSF pressure in patients with IIH during medical treatment. METHODS: Fourteen consecutive patients with IIH with bilateral TS stenosis on cerebral MR venography (MRV) during the medical treatment were studied. Patients were followed for over a 6-year period. During the follow-up, patients underwent repeated lumbar punctures (LPs) and cerebral MRV. MRV was always performed before each LP. RESULTS: TS stenosis persisted in all the patients during the follow-up. In 9 of 14 (64%) patients with IIH, CSF pressure normalized during medical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Transverse sinus (TS) stenoses, as revealed by MR venography, persist in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension after normalization of CSF pressure, suggesting the lack of a direct relationship between the caliber of TS and CSF pressure.
