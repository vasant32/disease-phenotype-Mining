Cerebral venous thrombosis may occur as a complication of infectious and noninfectious processes. In this study 56 patients with angiographically proven cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) affecting dural sinuses are being reported. Sixty-one percent of the patients were female and 60% were below 30 years of age. Sixty-four percent of the patients had lateral sinus thrombosis and in 26.8% of the cases a septic focus has been found. The diagnosis is established by serial angiography and clinical findings. CVT is not a rare disease while the clinical diagnosis may be difficult because of the variable modes of onset. As the CT findings are found to be non-specific, angiography remains as the best diagnostic tool. Early diagnosis, controlled intracranial pressure, and appropriate antibiotic treatment may reduce the mortality and morbidity rates due to CVT.
