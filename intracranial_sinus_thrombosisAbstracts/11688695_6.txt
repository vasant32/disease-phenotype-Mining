Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulae are direct arteriovenous shunts within the dura matter. We report two cases of arteriovenous fistulae upstream to a neoplastic dural sinus thrombosis. These cases add further support to the acquired etiology of dural arteriovenous fistulae and to the fact that venous hypertension is one of the most important precipitating factors.
