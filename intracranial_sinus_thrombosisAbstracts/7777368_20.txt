Lemierre's disease consists of suppurative thrombophlebitis of the IJV in the presence of oropharyngeal infection and can be complicated by septic pulmonary emboli. If a patient has an oropharyngeal or deep neck infection and neck pain suspicious for IJV thrombosis, a CT or MRI is warranted to establish the diagnosis. Blood cultures should be obtained to establish the responsible organism. In most cases F. necrophorum, an anaerobic bacterium, is responsible for the sepsis. Once the diagnosis of Lemierre's disease is made, long-term, high-dose intravenous antibiotics with beta-lactamase anaerobic activity should be initiated. In cases with persistent sepsis and emboli despite appropriate medical management, ligation or excision of the IJV should be performed. Finally, if there is clinical or radiologic evidence of retrograde cavernous sinus thrombosis, the use of anticoagulants should be considered.
