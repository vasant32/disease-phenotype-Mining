Deep cerebral venous thrombosis (DCVT) is a rare, potentially fatal disease. We carried out a retrospective analysis of eight patients presenting with DCVT, using CT and MRI data. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA), MR angiography (MRA) (2D phase-contrast), and angiography were performed in four, four and two patients, respectively. Direct (venous abnormalities) and indirect (parenchymatous involvement) signs of thrombosis were assessed. Follow-up MRI and MRA were performed on two patients. CT was initially normal in two patients, demonstrated a "cord sign" in deep veins in five and deep venous infarcts in three. When performed within a week of admission (seven patients), MRI showed thrombosis as into intense or high signal in deep veins on sagittal T1-weighted spin-echo images in all patients, and on axial T2-weighted spin-echo images in two. Deep venous infarcts were found in five patients. Direct or indirect signs of sagittal or lateral sinus thrombosis were present on CT in two patients and on MRI in five. CT angiography, MRA and DSA were concordant with MRI findings. CT venography showed persistent flow in thrombosed veins. MRI follow-up demonstrated progressive deep venous recanalisation.
