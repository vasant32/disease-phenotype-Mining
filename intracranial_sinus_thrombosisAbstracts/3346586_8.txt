One hundred and thirty patients with acute and acute on chronic mastoiditis were managed at Groote Schuur Hospital between 1980 and 1984. Twenty-two (16.9 per cent) had pathology of the lateral (sigmoid) sinus and 19 of these patients had cholesteatomas. Nine patients (40.9 per cent) had concomitant intradural sepsis and there were two deaths. The modern literature is reviewed and the pathology, presentation and management of lateral sinus pathology is discussed. This condition is rare and clinical features may range from subtle signs to gross toxaemia, torticollis and evidence of septic embolization. The otolaryngologist must be competent in diagnosing and treating this condition in all forms of its wide spectrum of presentation.
