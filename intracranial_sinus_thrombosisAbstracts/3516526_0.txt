The transarterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) examination of 4 patients studied for cerebral sinus venous thrombosis of the intracranial venous structures was reviewed to determine the reliability and adequacy of visualization of the venous drainage of the brain. In addition, 4 patients were specifically evaluated with DSA for venous sinus thrombosis of the intracranial veins and sinuses. Conditions studies included: Compression, or occlusion of the venous structures. Transarterial DSA is usually sufficient to replace conventional angiography in the evaluation of the cerebral sinus venous thrombosis (SVT).
