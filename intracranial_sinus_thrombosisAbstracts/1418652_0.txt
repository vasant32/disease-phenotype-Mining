We report two male adolescents who developed septic thrombosis of the cavernous sinuses after manipulation of a furuncle on the nasal dorsum. We noted in both patients, besides the clinical findings of a generalized infectious process, palpebral edema, proptosis, ptosis, altered pupillary reactivity and bilateral III, IV and VI nerve palsies, as well as dysfunction of the ophthalmic branch of the fifth cranial nerve. One of the patients also had bacterial meningitis. Their cerebral angiograms demonstrated narrowing of the intracavernous portion of both internal carotid arteries. They improved with the antimicrobial treatment, but were left with ptosis and ocular palsies as sequelae. The adequate management of facial furuncle to prevent such a serious complication is emphasized.
