A 38-year-old woman with thrombosis of the deep cerebral venous system, presumed to be secondary to the use of the oral contraceptive pill, is reported. The use of cerebral angiography and magnetic resonance imaging in establishing the diagnosis and management strategies is discussed. It is concluded that magnetic resonance imaging is an appropriate investigative modality for diagnosis and therapeutic decision making, and that, as with superficial cerebral dural sinus and venous thrombosis, anticoagulation is a safe and effective therapy.
