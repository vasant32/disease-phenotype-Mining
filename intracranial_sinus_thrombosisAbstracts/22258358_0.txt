There is a paucity of studies on spectrum of fungal infections in neurology care. This study reports clinical, MRI and outcome of patients with central nervous system (CNS) fungal infections. 39 patients with CNS fungal infections treated in neurology service during the last 3 years were included and a detailed medical history and clinical examination were undertaken. Cranial MRI including paranasal sinuses were carried out and the location and nature of abnormalities were noted. Fungal infection was confirmed by CSF examination or histopathology. Death during hospital stay was noted. The median age was 37 (8-72) years and 8 were females. The clinical features included altered sensorium in 31, focal motor deficits in 13, visual loss in 12, seizures in 10, diplopia in 7, and papilledema in 9 patients. 28 patients had the following predisposing conditions: HIV in 15, diabetes in 8, corticosteroid in 2 and alcohol, immunosuppression, neutropenia and analgesic abuse in 1 patient each. On CT or MRI scan, 5 patients had meningeal enhancement, 7 sinusitis, 10 each granuloma and infarction, 4 hydrocephalous and 1 cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. 28 patients had cryptococcal meningitis, 7 zygomycosis, 2 aspergillosis and 1 each candida and phaeohyphomycosis. Death was related to the type of fungal infection; all patients with zygomycosis and candida infection died. Rhinocerebral form of fungal infection due to zygomycetes has poorer survival compared to meningitis group which was mainly due to cryptococcal infection.
