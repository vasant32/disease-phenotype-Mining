OBJECTIVES: Acquire knowledge concerning the diagnosis and treatment of otogenic cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis. PATIENT AND METHODS: We report a case of otogenic cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis (CST) in a 6-year-old boy. RESULTS: CST diagnosis was based on clinical signs (septic illness, ocular nerve palsy and chemosis), and neuro-imaging confirmed the diagnosis. Contrast-enhanced CT scan demonstrates different signs: (i) filling defect or heterogeneous enhancement of cavernous sinus, (ii) cavernous sinus enlargement with bulging of the lateral wall, (iii) intensive enhancement of lateral wall corresponding to enhancement of a collateral network replacing the thrombosed cavernous veins, (iiii) and sometimes indirect orbital signs (exophthalmus, densification of the retro-orbital fat, superior ophthalmic dilatation with partial or no enhancement in case of thrombosis extension). The bacteria most frequently found are Streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative rods and anaerobes combined. The therapeutic management of CST consists of intravenous administration of appropriate antibiotics combined radical mastoidectomy if medical therapy has failed. Anticoagulant therapy is controversial. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of early diagnosis of otogenic cavernous sinus is important because prior to the antibiotic era, CST was almost always fatal. Currently, therapeutic outcome is not always favorable due to high morbidity after aggressive treatment.
