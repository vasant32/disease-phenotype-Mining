Among 5 875 children with a lifetime between 24 hours to 14 years, autopsiated during period 1951-1970, were found 115 cases of naked eye pulmonary thrombo-embolism. 96 cases occurred in children with a lifetime between 24 hours and 4 years. This extremly high frequency is caused by an unusually high number of thrombosis in renal veins and craneal sinuses, following severe diarrhetic diseases with deshydratation and haemoconcentration. Severity and frequency of this enterocolitis of different aetiology, affecting especially children of poor people, are favoured by the climatic, sanitarious and socio-economical conditions of Valencia. Surprisingly, literature do not mention comparables observations about infantil pulmonary thrombo-embolism, observed in territories of similar structure.
