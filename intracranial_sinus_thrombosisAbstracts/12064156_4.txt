A 57-year-old woman presented with a dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF) involving the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) based upon serial radiological examinations. Her chief complaints were headache and vomiting. Cerebral angiography and magnetic resonance (MR) venography revealed the sinus thrombosis involving the SSS, the bilateral transverse sinuses (TSs), and the right sigmoid sinus. Her symptoms disappeared after anticoagulant therapy. Follow-up MR venography revealed almost complete recanalization of the occluded sinuses, followed by restenosis of the SSS and the left TS and occlusion of the right TS without symptoms. She developed transient right hemiparesis 13 months after the initial onset. Cerebral angiography revealed a dural AVF involving the SSS with cortical reflux into the left frontoparietal region. The dural AVF was occluded by transarterial and transvenous embolization. Her symptom disappeared during the follow-up period.
