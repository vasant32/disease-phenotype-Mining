The aim of this study was to document the imaging abnormalities seen in the central nervous system (CNS) in cases of childhood leukaemia or as complications of its treatment. Magnetic Resonance (MR) images and Computed Tomographic (CT) scans were reviewed retrospectively in 22 children and adolescents with neurological manifestations/complications of leukaemia or its treatment. Among the 22 patients, nine had two or more different CNS abnormalities. The imaging abnormalities seen in 15 patients before or during treatment included sinus thrombosis, cortical vein thrombosis, cerebral haemorrhage, meningeal leukaemia, infections, skull leukaemic infiltration and treatment-related neurotoxicity. After therapy, seven patients had CNS abnormalities, including secondary brain tumours, skull tumour, mineralising microangiopathy, leucoencephalopathy, transient white matter abnormalities, spinal intradural haematoma, chronic subdural haematoma, radiation necrosis, meningeal leukaemia and leukaemic infiltration at the vertebral body. CNS complications are related to the inherent risk of leukaemia itself, to the treatment method and to the duration of survival.
