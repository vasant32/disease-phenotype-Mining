The incidence of cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis (CVST) is still unknown. Several assumptions of the incidence have been made. In the one and only series of consecutive brain autopsies series by Towbin in 1973 CVST was found in 10,9 % of patients aged 60 years or more. These findings suggest that the true incidence of CVST is higher than generally thought, but there are no other reports supporting these findings. Therefore in order to determine the incidence of latent CVST we conducted a new prospective post mortem study. All brain autopsies performed in our hospital between 1996 and 1998 on patients 60 years of age or older were examined for the presence of CVST in a prospective way. We examined the sagittal sinus, the torcula, the straight sinus, both transverse sinuses, and both sigmoideal sinuses for the presence of thrombosis. The clinical condition, medication, brain-imaging results, clinical cause of death, general findings from the body autopsy and definite cause of death were recorded. Additionally we requested the annual mortality figures of CVST at the department of the National Agency for Statistics of the Netherlands (CBS). A consecutive and prospective series of 102 brain autopsies was performed in our general hospital during a period of two years. We found one case of latent CVST in our series of 102 patients. Comparison with the findings of Towbin using a chi-square test yielded a significant difference in the incidence of latent CVST (chi(2) = 7.65, p < 0.01) between the two studies. The present autopsy study demonstrates that latent CVST is rare.
