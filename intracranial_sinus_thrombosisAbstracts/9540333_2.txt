A 69-year-old male presented with a jugular foramen schwannoma occluding the sigmoid sinus and associated with sigmoid sinus dural arteriovenous malformation. The patient presented with dizziness and pulsatile tinnitus following an extended period of hearing loss beginning several years before. Both lesions were resected successfully after transarterial embolization of the malformation. The sequence of symptom development suggests the dural sinus thrombosis caused the dural arteriovenous malformation.
