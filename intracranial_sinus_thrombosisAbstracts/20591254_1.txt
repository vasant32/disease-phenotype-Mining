Summary: The pathogenesis of dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) is currently unknown, with multiple DAVFs being rare. For patients with limited venous access secondary to sinus thrombosis, or for patients where parent sinus occlusion would not be tolerated, transvenous embolization may not be possible and other treatment methods must be considered. A 69-year-old female patient with a two-year history of progressive headaches, memory loss, and unsteady gait underwent cerebral angiography that revealed three separate DAVFs with congested cortical venous drainage overlying both frontal lobes. Using an application of a transarterial wedged-catheter, flow-arrest technique, N-butyl cyanoacrylate was deposited across all three pathologic arteriovenous connections providing a definitive cure. Transarterial NBCA embolization may provide curative treatment of DAVFs, and is of particular utility in situations where access to the draining venous structures is limited.
