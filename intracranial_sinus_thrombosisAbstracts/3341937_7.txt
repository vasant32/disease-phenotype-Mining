A rare case of homozygous protein C deficiency occurred in a newborn. The patient presented with purpura fulminans in the first few hours after birth and showed multiple hemorrhagic lesions on computed tomography of the brain at 5 days of age. Neurologic symptoms developed at two weeks and the patient died at 37 weeks. His protein C level was less than 5%. Autopsy revealed thrombosis of the dural sinuses, multiple cortical infarcts, intraparenchymal hemorrhages, and hydrocephalus. The pathologic findings are correlated with the neurologic deficits and previously documented cases are reviewed.
