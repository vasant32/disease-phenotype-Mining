The clinical course of spontaneous dural sinus thrombosis in children varies from indolent to fulminant. Although many different etiologies for the development of dural sinus thrombosis have been described, a full recovery can be anticipated in most children following rehydration and the administration of systemic antibiotics. Steroids, systemic anticoagulation and intrasinus thrombolysis may be beneficial in selected patients, although the efficacy of these therapies has not been established prospectively in children. We reviewed 12 pediatric patients with spontaneous dural sinus thrombosis (1978-1998) to determine the etiology, clinical course and best treatment options. In the absence of a hypercoagulable state, pediatric patients generally recover well with rehydration and antibiotics and do not require anticoagulation.
