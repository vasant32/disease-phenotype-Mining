A 35-year-old woman developed symptoms consistent with intracranial venous sinus occlusions that were demonstrated by MR angiography. After a few weeks of anticoagulant therapy, she became paraplegic due to haemorrhages in the caudal spinal canal. A decompressive laminectomy did not improve her neurological deficits. Up to this point, we assumed her condition to be caused solely by the intracranial venous thrombosis and complications of the treatment. A tumour diagnosis had so far not been considered. A few months later she became tetraplegic. MRI revealed fresh bleeding in the upper spinal cord and a dissemination of tumour along the entire craniospinal axis. Biopsy specimens obtained from the spinal canal contained tumour cells with the characteristics of neuroblastoma.
