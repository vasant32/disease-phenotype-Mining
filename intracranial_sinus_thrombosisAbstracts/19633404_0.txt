A 33-year-old female presented with an extremely rare case of chronic spinal subdural hematoma in the cervicothoracic region manifesting as sudden onset of flaccid paraplegia and urinary retention. She was receiving warfarin medication for an episode of superior sagittal sinus thrombosis 2 years earlier. Two months previously, she had undergone a minilaparotomy under general anesthesia following unsuccessful spinal anesthesia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large cervicothoracic extramedullary mass causing cord compression. However, laminectomy for excision of mass revealed a purely subdural hematoma. Her neurological deficits were partially resolved after removal of subdural hematoma.
