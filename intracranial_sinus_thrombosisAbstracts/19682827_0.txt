 BACKGROUND: Cerebral vein and dural sinus thrombosis is a rare condition with a wide range of causes and a highly variable presentation. It can lead to significant morbidity, but scant literature is available describing diagnosis and treatment when this occurs after ligation of the internal jugular vein. OBJECTIVES: To discuss potential risk factors for cerebral vein and dural sinus thrombosis after ligation of the internal jugular vein, and present current options for diagnosis and treatment. CASE REPORT: A 23-year-old male construction worker was brought to the Emergency Department by Emergency Medical Services after sustaining a severe neck laceration from a hand-held grinder. He was treated with ligation of the left internal jugular vein, but subsequently developed severe headaches and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. A magnetic resonance venogram of the head revealed a left transverse sinus thrombosis requiring treatment with anticoagulation. The placement of a lumboperitoneal shunt was ultimately needed for relief of his symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis and aggressive therapeutic interventions are critical to prevent further morbidity in patients who develop cerebral vein and dural sinus thrombosis after ligation of the internal jugular vein.
