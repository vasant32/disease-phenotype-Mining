Among 250 patients with Behcet's disease, we describe 25 cases of angiographically proven cerebral venous thrombosis. Intracranial hypertension was the most frequent manifestation. Two initially untreated patients relapsed. Treatment of cerebral venous thrombosis consisted of combined heparin and steroids in 19 patients, steroids alone in three, and heparin alone in three others. Neurologic symptoms improved rapidly in all. Nineteen patients received long-term anticoagulation, and two received aspirin. Relapse of cerebral venous thrombosis or development of optic atrophy did not occur in treated patients. Partial or total recanalization of the occluded sinus was frequent. After more than 3 years of follow-up, the prognosis of dural sinus thrombosis is satisfactory.
