31 children aged between 6 months and 14 years with various neurovascular abnormalities were examined by MR angiography in a prospective study. In order to test the sensitivity and specificity of the MR results, these were compared in 8 cases with the findings of digital subtraction angiography or conventional angiography. In 24 patients arterial MR angiography was performed; in 17 these showed anomalies or abnormalities of the intracranial vascular system. In 7 patients venous MR angiography was performed and demonstrated the presence of sinus thrombosis in 6 of these. Comparison between MR angiography and DSA showed agreement in 7 cases; in one patient the degree of a stenosis was exaggerated by MR. The results of this study indicate that arterial and venous MR is of great value as an additional study in paediatric neurovascular problems.
