Two patients presented with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) associated with iron deficiency. A 14-year-old man had thrombosis extending from the end of the superior sagittal sinus to the left transverse sinus. Severe dehydration after competitive sport had induced CVST. The laboratory findings showed severe iron deficiency anemia which persisted for 1 year. A 47-year-old man had thrombosis in the entire superior sagittal sinus. Dehydration caused by poor nutrition had induced CVST. The laboratory findings showed transient iron deficiency in the acute phase. Both patients received conservative treatment for dehydration and iron supplementation. These two cases indicate that iron deficiency is a risk factor for CVST.
