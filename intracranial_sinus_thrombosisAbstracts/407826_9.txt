Malignant external otitis is an infection which begins in the external auditory canal. It is uniformly caused by the Gram negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa organism and mainly affects elderly diabetics. It spreads to the soft tissues beneath the temporal bone and, if not properly treated leads to facial nerve palsy, mastoiditis, sepsis, osteomyelitis of the base of the skull, sigmoid sinus thrombosis, multiple cranial nerve palsies and death. Experience with 72 patients in varying stages of the disease is summarized. Stressed are the diagnostic criteria of nonresponsiveness to the usual methods of treatment, continued suppuration, and the continuing reformation of granulation tissue in the floor of the external auditory canal. Medical treatment is recommended with hospitalization and intravenous carbenicillin and gentamicin. Minor surgical debridement is helpful. All patients should be treated medically for as long as improvement continues, reserving surgical intervention only in the event a plateau is reached or symptoms and signs become worse under treatment. With or without a major surgical procedure, it is imperative to continue treatment for at least seven days after apparent cure in order to avoid recurrent disease possibly at a site distant from the canal.
