Middle ear cholesteatoma caused by repeated ear infections over time, destroys the delicate middle ear bones and causes permanent hearing loss or dizziness. It may grow to involve the facial nerve causing facial paralysis. In some instances, cholesteatomas can expand up into the brain, causing meningitis, sinus thrombosis, facial nerve palsy, vestibulitis and differently localized abscess. Nearly all patients with cholesteatoma require surgery to cure the disease. Therapeutic and rehabilitative surgical procedures were done, using either a closed technique (TCT) or an open technique: tympanoplasty in open technique (TOT). The aim of the work was to compare the advantages of TCT and TOT surgical technique for the treatment of cholesteatoma disease. The research was conducted in Tbilisi State Medical University Otorhino-laryngological Clinic on 65 patients with middle ear cholesteatoma: 21 women and 44 men in 2006-2008. Their average age was 29. The youngest was 7 years old, and the oldest one - 67. The investigation revealed that after TCT recidivations were noted in 16% of patients; after TOT in 42.3% of patients. It is concluded that CT technique is the most appropriate and optimal surgical interference for the treatment of chronic middle ear diseases.
