INTRODUCTION: Stroke is very seldom seen as the first manifestation of a neoplasia. The mechanisms that are most frequently involved in its pathogenesis are Trousseau's syndrome, haematological disorders such as disseminated intravascular coagulation or thrombocytosis, and the release of mucin by the tumour. Secondarily, non bacterial thrombotic endocarditis, septic or neoplastic cell embolism, venous sinus thrombosis and atherosclerosis secondary to radiotherapy have been reported. CASE REPORTS: Case 1: a 27-year-old male who presented a stroke in the right thalamus with a torpid progression and digestive complications; neuroimaging studies revealed unknown neoplasia of the head of the pancreas. Case 2: a 53-year-old male with repeated stroke (left sylvian and right occipitotemporal) and progressive neurological deterioration secondary to disseminated neoplastic disease, which had its origins in the body and tail of the pancreas. In both cases all the diagnostic explorations carried out in an attempt to determine the aetiopathogenesis of the stroke were negative. The post mortem study in the second patient revealed the existence of a non bacterial thrombotic endocarditis, which was taken as being one of the mechanisms involved. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenic mechanisms of cerebral ischemia associated to neoplasia are discussed and the primary and secondary forms are differentiated. We highlight the idea that when dealing with a stroke with an unknown aetiology and a torpid progression, the neurologist must consider the existence of a concealed neoplasia with stroke as its first manifestation.
