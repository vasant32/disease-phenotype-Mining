Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare but potentially life-threatening medical condition. We describe a case of a 47-year-old woman who presented with headache, speech defects, and visual disturbances, and was later diagnosed with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. The article describes a possible risk of such thrombotic events with exposure to high altitude environment in patients with coagulation defects such as Factor V Leiden mutation. Besides, such neurological conditions can occur independent of altitude illness and need to be recognized as their management differs.
