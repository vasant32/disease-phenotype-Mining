Complications of paranasal sinusitis constitute true surgical and medical emergencies. These complications appear to be more prevalent and seem to present in a more fulminant manner in the pediatric age group. The most common complication of paranasal sinusitis is orbital cellulitis followed collectively by all the intracranial complications. These include meningitis, subdural empyema, intracerebral abscess, epidural abscess and rarely cavernous or superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. We report the case of a 7-year old boy who presented with posterior scalp cellulitis and abscess as a complication of minimally symptomatic paranasal sinusitis. A combined neurosurgical and otolaryngologic approach was required to treat a unilateral ethmoid and frontal sinusitis associated with an epidural abscess abutting the length of the superior sagittal sinus and a posterior subgaleal abscess. The pertinent anatomy allowing for the development of this disease process is discussed. The danger of neurologic sequellae resulting from thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus is emphasized. Aggressive treatment utilizing a multi-disciplinary surgical approach as well as broad spectrum antibiotics is paramount to obtain the best chance for a full recovery.
