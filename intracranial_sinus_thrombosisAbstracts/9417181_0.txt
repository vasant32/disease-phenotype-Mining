BACKGROUND: Orbital or endocranial complications of sinusitis are rare clinical syndromes in infancy. METHODS: We retrospectively examined the complications that occurred and the role of functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FES). RESULTS: Most of the complications were caused by acute inflammation of the ethmoid or sphenoid cells with direct extension through dehiscent areas (flat bone) or neurovascular foramina. MRT had the highest sensitivity in detecting acute inflammatory foci. Early elimination of the cause of inflammation by FESS prevents spread of the complication. Advantages of FESS included better orientation and surgical access to the paranasal system of infants. The orbital complications were treated by surgical exploration of the communication pathways by a new endoscopic speculum. CONCLUSION: Early elimination of acute inflammatory foci by FESS prevents spread of infection in complications of paranasal sinusitis in infancy.
