The sue of bone wax is commonly used to control bleeding during mastoid surgery. An unusual case of bone wax granuloma in the mastoid, with sigmoid sinus thrombosis, is reported. Although the use of bone wax in and around the mastoid is generally considered safe with few complications, caution should be exercised, particularly in infected fields and in patients known to have general immunohypersensitivity.
