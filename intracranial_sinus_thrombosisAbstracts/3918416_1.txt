Prior efforts at experimental production of superior sagittal sinus (SSS) thrombosis generally have been unsuccessful. An experimental method was devised of inducing SSS thrombosis in the dog by use of double-lumen balloon catheters. Two balloon catheters, introduced into each internal jugular vein, are finally positioned at the torcular Herophili. The resulting stasis in the SSS, initiated by the inflated balloons, is augmented by injecting thrombin into the SSS. The stasis and the intraluminal thrombin cause thrombosis, which can be visualized on computed tomography (CT). This method may be used to study the natural history of SSS thrombosis as well as establish its CT and magnetic resonance imaging characteristics.
