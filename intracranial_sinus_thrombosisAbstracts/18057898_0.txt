BACKGROUND/AIM: The lateral sinus (LS) is composed of the transverse sinus (TS) and sigmoid sinus (SiS). METHODS: We studied the clinical pattern of complete or isolated LS thrombosis in 22 consecutive patients. RESULTS: Isolated LS thrombosis patients had a more severe clinical presentation, and more frequent intracranial hemorrhages and seizures. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that partial involvement of the LS in the thrombotic process may cause more severe clinical symptoms.
