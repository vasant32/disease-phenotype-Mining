Thrombosis of the straight and transverse sinuses associated with a large hemorrhagic venous infarct developed in an infant with large chronic subdural fluid collections after drainage of the subdurals. CT and MR studies obtained before and after the onset of venous sinus thrombosis showed interval widening of a segment of the posterior falx between the vein of Galen and the superior sagittal sinus. MR angiography confirmed a recanalized falcine sinus.
