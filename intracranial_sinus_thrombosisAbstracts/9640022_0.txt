A case of 44-year-old man is presented with no simultaneous bilateral posterior scleritis with amelanotic chorioidal mass initially diagnosed as intraocular tumor. The patient showed the features of nodular posterior scleritis without associated systemic disease. The case presented symptoms of severe eye pain, unilateral proptosis, hyperemia and dilatation of scleral, episcleral and conjunctival vessels. Diagnosis was made on the basis of B-scan ultrasonography. Differential diagnosis excluded melanoma malignum chorioideae, orbital cellulitis, Graves ophthalmopathy, orbital cellulitis, cavernous sinus thrombosis and carotid-cavernous fistula. The patient did not respond well to systemic steroids given in high doses and during slow tapering at the dosage of 30 mg prednisone once per day the symptom of uveal effusion syndrome occurred. After 10 months of steroid therapy the signs of disease like mild hyperemia and tenderness were still present. The adjunction of cyclosporin improved the disease and caused the remission.
