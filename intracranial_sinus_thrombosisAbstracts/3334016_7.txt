Three neonatal patients with superior sagittal sinus thrombosis are reported. The neurologic signs were bulging of the anterior fontanel and clonic hemi-convulsions. Neonatal polycythemia was believed to be an etiologic factor in two patients. Computed tomography revealed massive edema with slit-like ventricles in two patients. Increased density of the torcular Herophili and straight sinus also were demonstrated in two patients. The diagnosis of superior sagittal sinus thrombosis was confirmed by cerebral angiography in one patient and by digital subtraction angiography in the other two patients. Digital subtraction angiography appears to offer a definite advantage in the diagnosis of cerebral sinus thrombosis in the neonatal period.
