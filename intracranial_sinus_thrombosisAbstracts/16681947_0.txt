OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of injection of urokinase via carotid artery in treatment of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. METHODS: Thirty-nine New Zealand white rabbits were made into models of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with the superior sagittal sinus ligated and injected with suspension of cephalin kaolin and cephalin, and then were randomly divided into three groups: control group (n = 15), anticoagulation group (n = 12, infused with heparin 2 mgxkg(-1)xd(-1) via external carotid venous for 5 days), and thrombolysis group (n = 12, injected with urokinase 4000 Uxkg(-1)xd(-1) via carotid artery for 5 days). Laser Doppler scanning was used to determine the local cerebral blood flow before ligation, 20 and 90 min after ligation, and at the end of experiment. Five rabbits of the control group per each of the 3 time points (before ligation, 12 h after ligation, and at the end of experiment) were killed to collect the tissues of cerebral cortex in front of the ligated part to determine the brain water content. All the remaining rabbits were killed within 24 hours after the end of experiment to determine the brain water content and undergo microscopy. RESULTS: The local cerebral blood flow of the thrombolysis group was 94.8% +/- 0.3%, significantly higher than those of the anticoagulation group (88.6% +/- 0.3%) and control group (80.9% +/- 0.3%) (both P < 0.01). The brain water content of the thrombolysis group was 78.9% +/- 0.3%, significantly lower than those of the anticoagulation group (81.8% +/- 0.7%) and control group (82.1% +/- 1.0%) (both P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Improving the local blood flow and reducing the brain water content, injection of urokinase via carotid artery is effective in treatment of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.
