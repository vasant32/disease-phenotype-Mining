Two supra tentorial arteriovenous malformations of the dura are described. In one there was a direct localised shunt between the anterior and middle meningeal arteries, and the superior sagittal sinus. The shunt had resulted in varicosities of the cortical veins in both hemispheres. The second malformation was situated in the tentorium and the left occipital lobe and resulted in thrombosis of the left transverse sinus.
