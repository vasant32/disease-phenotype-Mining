Symptomatic vestibular schwannomas can be treated with resection (translabyrinthine, retrosigmoid [suboccipital], or middle cranial fossa approaches) or stereotactic radiosurgery. When appropriate, auditory brainstem stimulators can also be implanted in patients with current or impending hearing loss due to bilateral vestibular schwannomas. Imaging plays a prominent role in determining management following these procedures. In this article, the expected postoperative imaging appearances are depicted. The radiological features of complications are also reviewed, including recurrent tumor, fat graft necrosis, CSF leakage, infection, hydrocephalus, cerebral infarction, venous sinus thrombosis, hemorrhage, and temporal lobe and cerebellar contusions.
