A 63-year-old man developed a severe left frontal headache followed by an acute change of mentality 6 days later. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral thalamic ischemia. Angiography confirmed the occlusion of deep cerebral veins. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) of the thalami showed normal N-acetylaspartate (NAA) peak and the presence of lactate peak, indicating a relatively preserved neuronal viability. The patient improved during the follow-up period, and returned to work 45 days after the onset of the disease. With 1H-MRS, prognosis following venous infarctions may be feasible.
