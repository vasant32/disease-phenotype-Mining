A case of panfacial cellulitis with contralateral orbital cellulitis and blindness after extraction of a tooth has been reported. Contralateral orbital involvement, with sparing of the ipsilateral eye, constituted the unusual feature. This was considered to be a result of hematogenous spread rather than of direct extension.
