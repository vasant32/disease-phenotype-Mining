A case of cerebral venous thrombosis with intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhages was initially treated unsuccessfully with mechanical and pharmacologic thrombolysis using intrathrombus tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and angioplasty, and later successfully treated with an intravascular ultrasound tPA infusion catheter. This new microcatheter allowed direct infusion of tPA while using local therapeutic intravascular ultrasound to increase the thrombolytic effect. Flow was quickly restored. Our patient recovered from coma to discharge home without worsening of existing hemorrhages.
