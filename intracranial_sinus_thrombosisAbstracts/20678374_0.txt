Summary: Thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus may result in significant morbidity and recently up to 20% mortality, Primary treatment has consisted of anticoagulation and methods for controlling increased intracranial pressure. The development of interventional neuroradiologic techniques has enabled infusion of thrombolytics at the clot. We describe a woman with a cerebral haemorrhage due to a thrombosed superior sagittal sinus. Her decreased level of consciousness and increasing hemiparesis prompted direct thrombolytic therapy (urokinase). Flow was restored in the occluded sinus, but an acute expansion of the haematoma an hour after conclusion of the infusion resulted in temporary worsening of her neurologic deficits. Although the ultimate outcome was satisfactory, the possibility of further intracranial bleeding must be balanced against the risk of death with conservative therapy.
