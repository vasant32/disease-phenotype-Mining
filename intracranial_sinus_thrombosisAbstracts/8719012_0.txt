We report on a case of a 22-year old primigravida with HELLP syndrome in association with blindness and cerebral sinus thrombosis. The diagnosis of the cerebral sinus thrombosis was based on MRI 1h after delivery. Immediate caesarean section and intensive care treatment led to a complete recovery of the patient.
