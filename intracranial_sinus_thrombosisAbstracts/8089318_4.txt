OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to describe the neuroradiologic findings in hemorrhagic venous infarction related to a hypercoagulable state caused by antiphospholipid antibodies (aPA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on two patients with superior sagittal thrombosis related to the presence of aPA. RESULTS: A parenchymal region of hyperintense signal due to hemorrhagic venous infarction was demonstrated in both patients, along with abnormal signal within the thrombosed superior sagittal sinus. CONCLUSION: Hemorrhagic venous infarction may result from the hypercoagulable state related to aPA. The presence of these antibodies should be considered in the setting of otherwise unexplained dural sinus thrombosis and/or venous infarction.
