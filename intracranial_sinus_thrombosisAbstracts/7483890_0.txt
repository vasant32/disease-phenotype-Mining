In 15 adult cats the bridging draining into the superior sagittal sinus as well as their main tributaries were dissected under surgical microscope and ligated. Samples of tissue from cerebral cortex (CC) and subcortical white matter (SWM) with presumed disturbances of venous outflow were investigated by means of electron microscopy following different survival times (ranging from 3 to 15 days). The examination of the ultrathin sections from the CC and SWM disclosed signs of severe oedema: extensive areas of oedema fluid accumulation, swollen dendrited and synaptic endings, neurones with mitochondria destruction, disorganised endoplasmic reticulum and polysomal aggregates, prominent number of vacuoles, dendrites undergoing correspondent changes, degenerating axons and synaptic endings. The conspicuous presence of erythrocytes usually in perivascular zones of the neuropil, occluded, ruptured or collapsed capillaries having vacuoles in their endothelial cells were frequently encountered. These findings confirm the light microscopial observations demonstrating haemorrhagic infarctions after venous occlusions. They provide ultrastructural details about the CC and SWM changes resulting from venous hypertension and hypoperfusion.
