Inflammatory bowel diseases are associated with increased risk for thrombotic complications, In patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) cerebral sinus venous thrombosis (CSVT) is an extremely rare complication. We report a patient with active UC and CSVT. The patient was heterozygous for Factor V Leiden and G20210A prothrombin gene mutations without other identifiable precipitating factors. This patient highlights the need for investigating the patients with UC with thrombotic complications for other thrombophilic states.
