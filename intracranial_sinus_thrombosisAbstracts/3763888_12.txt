The magnetic resonance (MR) images of six patients with thrombosis of a dural sinus were reviewed. The diagnosis had been verified by computed tomographic scans in three patients and arteriograms in two; in the sixth patient, only MR imaging was used to confirm the clinical syndrome. In all patients, high-intensity signal was seen from the thrombus within the affected dural sinus on all echoes. This persistent signal intensity allowed intravascular clot to be distinguished from normal causes of increased signal such as flow-related enhancement (entry phenomenon) and even-echo rephasing. MR imaging demonstrated the cause of the thrombosis in three patients: two were secondary to adjacent tumors, and one was secondary to unsuspected mastoiditis. Complications such as infarction were also demonstrated. Using MR imaging, one can easily and safely diagnose thrombosis of a dural sinus. MR should be the imaging method of choice in patients suspected of having thrombosis of a dural sinus.
