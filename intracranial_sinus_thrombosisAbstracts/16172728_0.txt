Pseudotumor cerebri is a relatively common neurologic syndrome in adolescence. In most cases, etiology is idiopathic, but it may have serious complications, such as blindness, that are related to increased intracranial pressure. The aim of this article is to emphasize the differential diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri, with special attention to treatable etiologies. We report a case of an 12 year-old adolescent who presented with diplopia and headache 9 days after right-sided otitis media and mastoiditis. Head computerized tomography was normal, but brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated thrombosis of ipsilateral transverse and sigmoid sinuses, which responded promptly to early anticoagulation. The conclusion is that magnetic resonance imaging is essential for patients with a clinical diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri in order to exclude treatable causes, such as dural sinus thrombosis.
