Benign intracranial hypertension is known to be associated with obesity, endocrine abnormalities, various medications, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. We report a patient presenting with headaches and vomiting attributed to benign intracranial hypertension. The diagnostic work-up revealed Langerhans' cell histiocytosis of the occipital bone. There was no evidence for cerebral vein thrombosis by cranial computed tomography scan, Doppler ultrasonography, planar and single photon emission computed tomography technetium 99m-labelled red blood cell scintigraphy, and magnetic resonance angiography. Excision of the occipital bone lesion and a short course of acetazolamide and prednisone were curative. We hypothesize that cytokines secreted by the tumor were responsible for the development of intracranial hypertension.
