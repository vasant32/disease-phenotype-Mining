We report an unusual case of ophthalmoplegia after maxillofacial surgery. A thirteen year old girl with unilateral left cleft lip and palate underwent maxillary advancement by distraction osteogenesis. Postoperatively she developed diplopia. The diplopia was not due to orbital lesions, most often seen after maxillofacial surgery, but to a haemorrhage posterior to the cavernous sinus.
