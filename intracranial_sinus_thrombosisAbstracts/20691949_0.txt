Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is a relatively rare but serious condition, more commonly affecting children and pregnant women. It can be precipitated by dehydration. Despite the frequent coexistence of hemorrhage in venous infarcts of patients, clinical trials in adults recommended the use of anticoagulation. No randomized, clinical trials exist in the pediatric age group. Rarely, consumptive coagulopathy is reported to coexist with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. We report on a child with venous sinus thrombosis and consumptive coagulopathy developing after routine tonsillectomy and its successful management with anticoagulation.
