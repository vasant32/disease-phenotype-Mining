A 5-year old girl with cerebral palsy (CP), preterm birth, postnatal aortic thrombus, and cerebellar venous infarction who is homozygous for the thrombophilic factor-V Leiden (fVL) mutation is reported. The role of hereditary thrombophilic disorders in the development of perinatal vascular lesions such as aortic thrombi, renal-vein thrombosis, venous-sinus thrombosis, and cerebral infarction is unknown. This case report brings into question a potential association between fVL, perinatal vascular lesions, perinatal stroke, and CP.
