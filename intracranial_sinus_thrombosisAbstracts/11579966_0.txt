A previously healthy 60-year-old man had a two-year history of dizziness or faintness when eating but not when drinking. MRI of the brain detected deep venous dilatation, and digital subtraction cerebral angiography showed superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. These symptoms were completely resolved after the daily administration of 200 mg ticlopidine for four weeks. The pathomechanism of this unusual presentation is speculated episodic congestion of the jugular venous drainage during mealtime due to an increase in the circulatory volume of the external carotid-jugular system.
