INTRODUCTION: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is a rare condition that is generally associated with acute processes, one of the most important being mastoiditis. Associated prothrombotic disorders can be detected in approximately half of all cases, regardless of the aetiology. Patients usually present clinical symptoms like headache, convulsions and diminished level of awareness, this latter factor being linked to a poor prognosis. CASE REPORTS: We report the cases of two paediatric patients with a clinical picture of intracranial hypertension within a context of mastoiditis as a complication of an acute ear infection, in whom cerebral venous sinus thrombosis was identified. Both patients were treated with lumbar punctures to evacuate cerebrospinal fluid and diuretic therapy. Anticoagulant therapy was added in the case of the second patient. Nevertheless, because of the persistence of the symptoms of intracranial hypertension, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt had to be performed in this patient. CONCLUSIONS: The preferred diagnostic method is magnetic resonance imaging with venography, although in an emergency computerised tomography can help reach a diagnosis in a third of cases. In addition to treating the symptoms, anticoagulation is also accepted (degree of evidence 1B) to prevent further progression.
