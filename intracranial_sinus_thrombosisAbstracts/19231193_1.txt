Beh√ßet's disease (BD) is a systemic inflammatory disease commonly characterized by oral and genital ulcerations, with skin and eye involvement. Its cause is still unknown, but vasculitis is the major pathologic feature. BD is a rare condition, seen more commonly in Turkey, as well as in Middle Eastern, Mediterranean and Far Eastern countries. Neurological involvement is reported to manifest as brainstem or corticospinal tract syndromes, increased intracranial pressure mostly related to venous sinus thrombosis or aseptic meningitis, isolated behavioral symptoms or isolated headache. This report presents a 34-year-old BD patient with secondary cerebral infarction due to head trauma. The clinical and central nervous system findings of BD are discussed.
