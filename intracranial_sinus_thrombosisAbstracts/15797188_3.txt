An 8(1/2)-year-old-female child with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome developed sagittal sinus thrombosis while on pulse therapy with corticosteroids, presenting with recurrent vomiting, headache, and impaired consciousness. The diagnosis was established by cranial computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance angiography. She gradually recovered without neurologic sequelae while being treated with low-molecular-weight heparin (2 mg/kg/day). Sagittal sinus thrombosis consists of a rare and probably underdiagnosed complication of childhood nephrotic syndrome.
