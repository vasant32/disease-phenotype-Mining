Burkholderia pseudomallei infection of the central nervous system (CNS) is rare with less than 50 cases reported over the last 30 years. The retrospective melioidosis study at University Malaya Medical Centre has documented three cases of CNS melioidosis out of more than 160 cases of melioidosis since 1978. There were two patients with brain abscess and one with spinal epidural abscess. The predisposing factors were: one patient was an aboriginal farmer and the other two were diabetic. Their age ranged from 17 to 45 years. Prominent neurological features were limb weakness, cranial nerve palsy (6th and 7th) and visual disturbance. CT brain scan and MRI spine showed abscess formation, subdural collection, and spinal epidural collection, osteomyelitis of vertebra and occipital bone and also sagital sinus thrombosis. All these patients underwent surgical drainage leading to bacteriological diagnosis as well as appropriate long-term antibiotic therapy. All had good recovery at 6 months after completion of treatment.
