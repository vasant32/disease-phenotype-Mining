Dural sinus thrombosis after closed head injury is seen very rarely and its pathophysiological mechanisms are not yet understood. An 18-year-old man who had been crushed in an automobile had closed head injury with Glasgow Coma Score 4. Computerized tomography showed diffuse cerebral edema and right occipital linear fracture extending to the internal jugular foramen. Because of high- level intracranial pressure, he underwent bilateral frontotemporoparietal craniectomy. After surgery, magnetic resonance scan with venography showed that the right internal jugular vein was obliterated from the torcular Herophili and the left internal jugular vein was very thin in calibration. He was discharged home with Karnofsky performance score of 30/90. Dural sinus thrombosis with dominant side can carry high morbidity and mortality if not treated immediately.
