Sinus thrombosis, which causes pseudotumor cerebri, is difficult to diagnose with conventional imaging apparatus, CT and MRI. We report a case of sinus thrombosis due to Behçet's disease diagnosed by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). A forty-five-year old man with severe headache and ocular pain was examined. Since he had a history of oral ulcers, genital ulcers, and erythema nodosum venous thrombosis, he had been diagnosed as having Behçet's disease previously. He showed marked papilledema bilaterally but no obvious intracranial lesion was observed by CT and MRI. On MRA, an obstruction was apparent at the sagittal sinus. Anticoagulant and steroid therapy were effective to relieve the headache, and to improve the constricted visual field temporarily. By MRA, blood flow was confirmed in the sagittal sinus. However, mild papilledema persisted and finally vision was lost because of optic atrophy.
