BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media is a common disease, mostly contracted at childhood. The development of acute mastoiditis has been decreased since the introduction of antibiotics. Currently it is only developed in 0.004 % cases of acute otitis media. But despite of this fact, even today one should not neglect this condition as the complications such as intracranial spread and lateral sinus thrombosis are still life threatening. METHODS AND PATIENTS: In a retrospective study from 01/96 - 09/00 we reviewed the cases of acute mastoiditis as a result of acute otitis media at our department. Additionally we compared study results out of 1972 until 1989 with our current results. RESULTS: Altogether mastoidectomy has been carried out at 157 patients. The cases have steadily increased since 1996. This is confirmed by comparison with study results of previous years. The majority of the patients were between 8 months and 3 years old (60 %). When the patients first presented at our department, the first signs of otitis media were 19.5 days ago in average. 38 % of the patients received no antibiotic treatment before admission. A thickened mucous membrane was seen by the mastoidectomy mostly (58 %). A subperiostal abscess we noted in 8.5 %. The most common isolated bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (33 %) and Streptococcus pyogenes (11 %). The patients stayed at the department about 10 days. In comparison to recent study results the "typical" mastoiditis has decreased. The causative pathogens have not changed. CONCLUSIONS: In the last years we realised an increasing number of mastoiditis at our department. The isolated bacteria are the same as presented in the literature. Early surgery combined with an effective antibiotic treatment can avoid the known complications of mastoiditis.
