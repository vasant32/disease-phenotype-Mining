 BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the plasma levels of factor VIII (FVIII), von Willebrand factor (vWF) and their association in patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). METHODS: We prospectively included 25 CVST patients admitted to the university hospital and 53 voluntary subjects as a control group. FVIII and vWF were measured after 6 months when anticoagulant therapy was stopped. RESULTS: The mean FVIII and vWF levels were significantly higher in the CVST group compared to the control group (126.21 ± 54.69 vs. 91.9 ± 48.8 IU/dl; p = 0. 012; 157.05 ± 107.74 vs. 94 ± 84%; p = 0.01, respectively). Using analyses calculating the 95th percentile cut-off values, we found high levels of FVIII in patients compared to controls (29.2 vs. 5%; p = 0.01) and the odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI) was 7.82 (1.46, 41.6). After adjustment for vWF levels, sex and age, the risk remained significantly increased and the odds ratio with 95% CI was 10.5 (1.1, 101.4) (p = 0.041). CONCLUSION: FVIII is one of the most prevalent risk factors of CVST and may be associated with an approximately tenfold increased risk for developing CVST. This effect is independent of vWF levels; however, vWF is not an independent risk factor of CVST.
