A 44-year-old man presented with a 12-day history of severe non-throbbing headache. He showed no physical abnormality but obesity. On day 12, ring-shaped low intensity lesions inside straight sinus were revealed on T2*-weighted MRI image (T2*WI). On the following day (day 13), he was found unresponsive at home, and ambulated with disturbed consciousness. FLAIR and diffusion-weighted MRI image disclosed high intensity signals in bilateral thalamus which were postulated as vasogenic edema. MR venography and conventional cerebral angiography showed an absence of flow in inferior sagittal sinus, vein of Galen, and straight sinus. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). Anticoagulant treatment was introduced and his consciousness level was gradually improved. On day 43, he was discharged with no neurological sequelae. A delay of correct diagnosis and treatment with CVT can lead to devastating disability or even to death. An early diagnosis of CVT is often dismissed owing to the nonspecific symptoms such as headache and nausea. Recent reports described high sensitivity of T2*WI for detecting CVT. Alterations in blood flow and oxyhemoglobin reduced products, deoxyhemoglobin, in thrombosed veins often produce the magnetic susceptibility on T2*WI. A detection of ring-shaped low intensity lesions within venous sinus on T2*WI were quite rare, and the signal changes of these sinus lesions were successfully visualized by chronological T2*WI. Taken together, our case implies that T2*WI is the powerful tool for the early detection of CVT, even before the critical symptoms might happen.
