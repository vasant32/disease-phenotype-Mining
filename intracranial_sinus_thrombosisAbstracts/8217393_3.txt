Radiological and clinical analysis was performed in 5 patients with posterior fossa dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) with isolated sinus segment due to sinus thrombosis, and their patho physiological, diagnostic, and therapeutic concerns were discussed. Patients ranged in age from 36 to 73 years old with a mean of 57 years and included 2 males and 3 females. Two patients presented with ataxia, one with ataxia and bruit, one with atypical facial pain, and one with parietal dysfunction. One patient had a history of hemorrhagic event. DAVFs were located at transverse-sigmoid sinus (3 cases), superior petrosal sinus (1 case), and straight sinus (1 case). They were fed by many branches of external carotid artery including middle meningeal artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, posterior auricular artery, occipital artery, meningeal branches of vertebral artery and posterior cerebral artery, and meningohypophyseal trunk of internal carotid artery. Shunt flow drained into contralateral transverse-sigmoid or supratentorial sinuses via the isolated venous segment through markedly dilated cortical and/or deep venous systems, which caused altered normal venous drainage pattern and venous hypertension. Transarterial embolization in multiple stages (mean 3.4) using n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) could alleviate symptoms in all cases. DAVFs were almost totally obliterated in 3 patients. Further embolization in one case, and surgical excision in one case were planed because of some residual dilated cortical venous drainage. Posterior fossa DAVFs with isolated sinus segment accompany markedly dilated cortical and/or deep venous systems. They could cause cerebellar, brainstem, or cranial nerve dysfunctions, and sometimes present distant supratentorial symptoms or hydrocephalus due to abnormal venous drainage and venous hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
