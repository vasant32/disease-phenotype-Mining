A 48-year-old female received serial combination chemotherapy including L-asparaginase (L-ASP) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. After administration of L-ASP, the prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were prolonged, while fibrinogen and antithrombin III levels markedly decreased, so she was given fresh frozen plasma (FFP). But subsequently, she developed cerebral infarction in the left parietal region and further hemorrhagic infarction in the right parietal region, and died. Autopsy revealed superior sagittal sinus thrombosis and bilateral cerebral infarction, but no obvious thrombus in other organs. Coagulopathy following L-ASP therapy is well-known. In this case, the coagulation studies at the first attack showed that the plasma protein levels of coagulation and fibrinolysis factors decreased in spite of administration of FFP. Fibrin-fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) slightly increased. However there were no significant abnormalities in the platelet count, nor soluble fibrin monomer, which suggested no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Thus, these findings suggest that L-ASP might be associated with the pathogenesis of thrombosis in this case.
