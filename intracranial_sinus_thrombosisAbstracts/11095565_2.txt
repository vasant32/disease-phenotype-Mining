Most frequently, chronic granulomatous meningitis (CGM) is caused by infectious agents. However, in some cases the cause of CGM remains undetermined. It is unclear whether antimicrobial agents, including antituberculous drugs, are helpful in such cases. We describe a 61-year-old man who had multiple cranial nerve lesions, epilepsy, sinus thrombosis, stroke, and hydrocephalus attributable to CGM. Repeated extensive search for a causative agent in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the meninges remained negative. Only a single culture of the sputum revealed growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which prompted antituberculous therapy with isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol. After 6 months of therapy, neurologic abnormalities were slightly improved. We conclude that antimicrobial/ antituberculous agents have only a minor short-term effect in long-lasting CGM of undetermined cause.
