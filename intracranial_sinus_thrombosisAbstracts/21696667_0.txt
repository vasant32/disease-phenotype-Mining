We describe the case of a 26-year-old man with orthostatic headache. Cerebral angiography revealed thrombosis in the sagittal sinus. Spine MRI showed cerebrospinal fluid collection at the C1-2 level. We performed blood patch and the symptoms disappeared. We report a rare case of intracranial hypotension caused by CSF leak and describe our hypothesis that SIH can change the velocity of cerebral blood flow and cause thrombosis.
