OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to report the association of dural sinus thrombosis with a hypercoagulable state associated with activated protein C resistance. CONCLUSION: In our small study population, hemorrhagic venous infarction was common (three of four patients) among patients with dural sinus thrombosis and activated protein C resistance. Four of five patients with dural sinus thrombosis had positive tests for activated protein C resistance. This finding, in conjunction with data from other studies, suggests that patients with dural sinus thrombosis may need to be studied for the presence of activated protein C resistance. A positive finding for activated protein C resistance can be important not only in helping to explain the cause of thrombosis in affected individuals but also in identifying families at risk for thrombosis.
