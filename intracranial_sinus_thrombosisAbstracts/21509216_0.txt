Spontaneously occurring epidural haematomas are an uncommon entity. A spontaneous post fossa epidural haematoma due to sigmoid sinus thrombosis secondary to mastoiditis has not been reported in English medical literature. We report a 40 year-old man who presented to us with headache and incoordination. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed epidural sub-acute bleeding in the right side of posterior fossa with mastoiditis and right sigmoid sinus thrombosis. A right suboccipital craniotomy and evacuation of the haematoma was done and the patient was relieved of his complains.
