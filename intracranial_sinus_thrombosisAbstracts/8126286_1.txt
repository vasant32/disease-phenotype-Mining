Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a disease of children characterized by idiopathic proliferation of histiocytes in the reticuloendothelial system. Intracranial LCH involving the brain is uncommon. We present a case of LCH involving the dural venous sinuses and choroid plexus. Contrast MRI provided an excellent means of identifying the extent of tumor involvement and showed that the patient was at risk for venous sinus thrombosis.
