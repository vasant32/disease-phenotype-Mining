The systemic manifestations of Behçet disease were evaluated retrospectively in 45 patients. Twenty-seven patients underwent radiographic examination. Twenty-two examinations (64.7%) showed positive but nonspecific findings, most of them involving the vascular tree. The roentgen diagnosis of Behçet disease will be influenced by the dermatologic and ophthalmologic findings.
