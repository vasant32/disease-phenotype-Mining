Dural sinus thrombosis is a rare, potentially fatal complication of a radical neck dissection. The prognosis can vary from complete recovery to rapid death. Magnetic resonance venography provides an effective, noninvasive diagnosis. The goals of therapy are to decrease intracranial pressure and to lyse the thrombus. Systemic anticoagulation and systemic thrombolytics are controversial therapies. The direct intrasinus infusion of thrombolytic agents is under investigation.
