Twenty-three patients with benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) were seen at the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, Sydney over an 18 year period to 1988. Age at presentation ranged from 6 months to 13 years and 5 months. The female to male ratio was 2.3:1. The aetiological factors (sometimes multiple) included: chronic middle ear infection, 30%; dural sinus thrombosis, 22%; head injury, 13%; Vitamin A overdosage, 4%; tetracycline exposure, 4%; and no apparent cause, 43%. Headache was the most common presenting symptom occurring in 91% of patients, followed by vomiting in 65% and blurred or double vision in 57%. Papilloedema occurred in 96% of patients, abducens palsy was noted in 48% and visual impairment in 45%. All patients improved clinically after treatment, one with lumbar puncture only. Of 17 patients treated with steroids, 10 patients recovered and seven patients went on to lumboperitoneal shunt. Two patients recovered with steroid and diuretic treatment. Of two patients initially treated with diuretics only, one recovered and one subsequently required a shunt. Only one patient was initially treated with a lumboperitoneal shunt. Three of the shunted patients had shunt block requiring revision. None had permanent visual loss or other significant sequelae. The visual prognosis of BIH in childhood is good. In view of the relatively high complication rate of steroids and shunting, a controlled comparison of steroid vs acetazolamide/diuretic therapy should be undertaken.
