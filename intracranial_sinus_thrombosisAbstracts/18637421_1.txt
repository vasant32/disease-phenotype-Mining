INTRODUCTION: Otogenic intracranial complications are rare. Misdiagnosed and untreated can be dangerous for health and life. They should be always kept in mind. AiM: We discuss patients in whom defects of skull base were observed during operation. These defects can lead to serious intracranial complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyse patients with chronic otitis media operated in our department between 2004-2006. 250 operations on ears were performed in that period of time. We discuss patients with intracranial otogenic complications and patients in whom defects of skull base were noticed by chance during operations. RESULTS: Defects of skull base were observed in 24 cases. Intracranial complications were in 3 patients. 1 patiens died because of abscess of cerebellum, others were treated with good distant effect. Used methods of reconstruction were effective, we observed no discharge of cerebro-spinal fluid and no other intracranial complications. CONCLUSIONS: It exists group of patients with chronic otitis media that have asymptomastic defects of cranial fossa. These defects can be responsible for intracranial complications. MRI and TC are very important in preoperative diagnostics.
