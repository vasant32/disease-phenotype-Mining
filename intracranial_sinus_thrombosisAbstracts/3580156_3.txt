Eighty-two temporal bone fractures were diagnosed in 75 patients with high-resolution computed tomographic scanning. Excluding six gunshot injuries, 55 (72%) of the fractures were oblique, 11 (15%) were longitudinal, and ten (13%) were transverse. Facial paresis or paralysis occurred in 45 patients (60%), hemotympanum occurred in 67 (89%), and cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea occurred in 19 (25%). Among 66 patients in whom audiometry was performed, 20 (30%) had conductive hearing loss, nine (14%) had sensorineural loss, and 36 (55%) had mixed hearing loss. Vestibular symptoms were present in 23 patients (30%). Other unusual complications of temporal bone fractures were observed: bilateral abducens paralysis, three patients (4%); unilateral abducens paralysis, two (2.67%); trigeminal paralysis, one (1.33%); and aseptic sigmoid sinus thrombosis, one (1.33%).
