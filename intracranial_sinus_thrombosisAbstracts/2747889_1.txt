With T1-weighted gradient recalled echo (GRE) MR images and flow compensation, we studied the superior sagittal sinus in 3 normal volunteers and 3 patients with sinus occlusion. In these images, sites of patency of the superior sagittal sinus were identified due to the high signal intensity of the normal sinus. Tumor invading the sinus was nearly isointense with cerebral gray matter. T1-weighted GRE imaging proves to be an effective technique to evaluate sinus blood flow.
