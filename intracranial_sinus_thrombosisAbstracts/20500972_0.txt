BACKGROUND: The vaginal contraceptive ring is a hormonal contraceptive that releases etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare but serious complication of hormonal contraceptive use. CASE: We present a case of CVST in a 33-year-old nulligravid woman who was using a vaginal contraceptive ring. At the time of presentation, she had been using the ring for 18 months, having previously used oral contraceptives for 13 years. She had no additional risk factors for thrombosis apart from cigarette smoking. Despite vigorous management, the patient died from the effects of the CVST. CONCLUSION: The serious adverse effects of the vaginal contraceptive ring are not well known, although deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and aortic thrombosis in association with use of the ring have been reported to Health Canada. Continuing post-market surveillance of thrombotic risk in users of the vaginal contraceptive ring is critical.
