In most cases of deep venous sinus thrombosis, systemic anticoagulation represents the initial treatment of choice for preventing propagation of a clot in the dural sinuses. In patients with deep or extensive venous sinus thrombosis, a combination of treatment modalities may be required including systemic anticoagulation, selective venous thrombolysis, and mechanical thrombectomy. In the current study the authors report on a patient who presented with the acute onset of headache, vomiting, a depressed level of consciousness, and a left hemiparesis and in whom a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic conversion was initially diagnosed. Results of diagnostic cerebral angiography demonstrated a patent right MCA and a deep venous sinus thrombosis involving most of the dural sinuses. Despite adequate systemic heparinization, the patient's neurological condition deteriorated and direct administration of alteplase into the transverse sinus in conjunction with mechanical clot disruption using a coronary AngioJet was required. Venous flow was successfully reestablished in the deep and superficial venous sinuses by using a 0.014-in exchange wire routed from the right common femoral vein through the sinuses and out the left common femoral vein. Excellent angiographic results were obtained, and the patient had recovered completely by the 7-month follow up.
