 BACKGROUND: To recognize ocular presentations in cranial venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) which were easy to be misdiagnosis. DESIGN: Retrospective study. METHODS: Review clinical informations including general informations, general performances, and ocular presentations of 118 inpatients with CVST in the general hospital of chinese people's liberation army during 2005-2009. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The ocular symptoms as the initial onset presentations or simultaneous phenomenon among different onset type patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Of all the CVST patients, 21.2% (25/118) presented with ocular symptom as the initial presentation, 30.5% (36/118) presented with ocular symptom as well as the other symptoms, and 48.3% (57/118) presented with non-ocular symptoms as the initial onset. The CVST patients were divided into 3 groups according to the onset type. There was no marked statistical significance among groups. The most common major complaints were blurring and degeneration of acute vision, accounting for 85.9% (61/71) of all abnormal ocular chief complaints. The most common objective sign in eyes was papilloedema, accounting for 48.3% (57/118) in this group of CVST patients. About 22.4% (13/58) showed acute vision deterioration at 1-year follow-up, due to optic atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: As ophthalmologists, we should master the onset characteristics and clinical manifestations of CVST. Early diagnosis and treatment is very important for the prevention of vision deterioration, especially for patients with ocular syndrome as the initial onset syndrome. For isolated agnogenic intracranial hypertension, we should consider the possibility of CVST.
