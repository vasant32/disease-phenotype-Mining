The clinical course of twins with osteopetrosis has provided a catalogue of the neurological complications that may occur with the disorder. Such a list has not previously been compiled: (1) Hydrocephalus - probably due to outflow obstruction in the posterior fossa. (2) Sagittal sinus thrombosis - due to bony encroachment, or to hematological causes. (3) Exophthalmos - due to bony encroachment in the orbit. (4) Foraminal occlusion at the base of the skull, producing compromise of cranial nerves and vessels. (5) Paraparesis - cause unknown, perhaps due to spinal stenosis. (6) Anemia - myelophthisic, although a hemolytic component due to hypersplenism has been identified, as well.
