Extensive cerebral venous sinus thrombosis may cause death or severe neurologic sequelae. A minimally responsive 10-year-old boy with thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus, left transverse and left sigmoid sinus, torcular, vein of Galen, and straight sinus underwent fibrinolytic therapy with urokinase during transfemoral venous angiography. He improved dramatically during the procedure as antegrade venous flow was re-established. Local thrombolytic therapy may be beneficial for other patients with rapid neurologic deterioration caused by extensive thrombosis of superficial and deep venous structures.
