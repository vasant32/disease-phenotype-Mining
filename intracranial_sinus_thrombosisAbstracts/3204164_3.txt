Traumatic carotid-cavernous sinus fistula is an uncommon situation resulting from severe trauma, with less than 40 cases having been reported. It is usually associated with a skull base, frontal or mid-facial fracture, but it may also be a spontaneous phenomenon of congenital, infective or degenerative origin. The blood shunts from the internal carotid to the cavernous sinus resulting in pulsating exophthalmos, orbital headache, pain, orbital or frontal bruit, loss of visual acuity, diplopia, ophthalmoplegia and the differential diagnosis should include superior orbital fissure syndrome, orbital apex syndrome and cavernous sinus thrombosis. Several modes of treatment have been proposed. We were recently faced with such a case, who had sustained fractures of the facial skeleton and developed the fistula despite an initial non-contributory angiogram. The patient remained in a permanent coma.
