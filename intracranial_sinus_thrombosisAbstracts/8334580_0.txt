Cerebral vein thrombosis, also called superior sagittal sinus thrombosis, is a well recognized clinical and radiologic entity associated with a variety of medical disorders. We report a patient with fatal cerebral vein thrombosis following myelography, in whom the cause was familial antithrombin III (AT3) deficiency. Unsuspected AT3 deficiency should be considered in cases of unexplained cerebral venous thromboses.
