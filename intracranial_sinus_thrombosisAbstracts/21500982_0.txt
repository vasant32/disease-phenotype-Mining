Thromboembolic diseases are accepted as the most important complications in adult nephrotic syndrome, particularly membranous nephropathy. As renal vein thrombosis is usually seen in patients with membranous nephropathy, cerebral venous thrombosis is a very rare condition, which has not been reported previously in adult patients with membranous nephropathy. Although acquired dysfunctions of coagulation and fibrinolytic systems are responsible for hypercoagulopathy in patients with nephrotic syndrome, the two most common causes of hereditary venous thrombosis [the mutations of factor V Leiden and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)] facilitate thrombosis in arterial and venous system in these patients. We report a 56-year-old man with sinovenous thrombosis, diagnosed as membranous nephropathy and detected to have mutations in factor V Leiden and MTHFR A1298C. Our patient is important because he had genetic risk of thrombotic conditions and was the first adult patient with membranous nephropathy.
