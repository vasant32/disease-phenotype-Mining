Two cases of dural arteriovenous malformation (DAVM) of the posterior fossa were presented and a histopathological examination was described. After embolization of the feeding arteries, DAVMs of the posterior fossa were removed with the adjacent sinus. Serial sections of the surgical specimens showed an abnormal mass with dilated, tortuous vessels of varying diameters in the sinus wall, and partially hyalinized connective tissue around the vessels. The elastic lamina of the sinus wall was interrupted and a mass of abnormal vessels developed into the subintimal layer of the sinus. Fistulas, about 200 microns in diameter, were formed between arterialized dural veins and dural arteries which had obvious internal elastic lamina. An opening of the fistula of the abnormal vessel, 25 microns in diameter, to the sinus lumen was also seen. No stage of organized thrombus could be seen in the sinus lumen. These findings strongly suggested that physiologically existing arteriovenous fistulas within the dura mater, which have been reported by Kerber et al, had developed due to many factors which increase intracranial pressure. They protruded into the sinus lumen in such a way that it could cause stenosis or obstruction of the sinus. In conclusion it can be said that an obstructive lesion of dural sinus is considered of itself to be DAVM in most cases and sinus thrombosis is the result of the DAVM.
