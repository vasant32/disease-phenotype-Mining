Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is a rare acquired disorder of clonal hematopoietic stem cells and it is characterized as a hypercoagulable disorder. We report a 36-year-old woman with the rare triad of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, cerebral sinus thrombosis triggered by infection, and rapid-onset heparin-induced thrombocytopenia after resensitization of heparin. This case raises caution for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.
