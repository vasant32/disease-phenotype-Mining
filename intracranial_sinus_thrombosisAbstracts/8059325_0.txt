Infectious intracavernous carotid artery aneurysms usually present with ophthalmoplegia and/or signs of cavernous sinus thrombosis. We report an unusual case in which a patient with AIDS presented with intractable epistaxis secondary to rupture of a giant infectious intracavernous carotid artery aneurysm. Culture of the aneurysm grew mycobacterium avium intracellulare (MAI). The patient was treated successfully by excision of the aneurysm and reconstruction of the internal carotid artery with a saphenous vein interposition graft.
