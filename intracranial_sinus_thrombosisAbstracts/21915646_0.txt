Although patients of cerebral sinus thrombosis after intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been previously reported; reports of cerebral venous thrombosis secondary to subcutaneous injection of immunoglobulin (SIG) in conjunction with oral contraceptives are nonexistent in the current literature.

Furthermore, we shall explore proper clinical precautions for someone who receives IG therapy, especially in conjunction with the use of oral contraceptives.
