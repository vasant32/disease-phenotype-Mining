OBJECT: Sinus thrombosis following a closed mild head injury is rare. A case of dural sinus thrombosis following a mild closed head injury due to an uncommon cause is reported. METHODS: A 7-year-old child presented with GCS 15 after a road traffic accident. CT revealed an occipital fracture. Ten days later the child developed signs of increased intracranial pressure. An MR venogram at this time revealed thrombosis of the transverse sinus with hypoplasia of the contralateral transverse and sigmoid sinuses. The patient's anitiphospholipid antibody titres were elevated. The patient was treated with anticoagulants and improved. CONCLUSIONS: The role of inherited and acquired procoagulant factors in the aetiology of sinus thrombosis is increasingly being recognized. When a patient presents with sinus thrombosis after a closed mild head injury, it is necessary to investigate for the presence of risk factors for thrombophilia as it has implications for the long-term management of the patient.
