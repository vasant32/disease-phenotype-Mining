A cured case of superior sagittal sinus thrombosis is reported. The patient, a 26-year-old man, also displayed severe complications such as hemorrhagic infarction and status epilepticus. Although his prognosis was considered to be extremely poor, conservative treatment, with mannitol, steroid, anticonvulsants, etc. was effective, and he was discharged without any neurological deficit. This report discusses the clinical course, CT findings, angiographical findings and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). At first, CT showed no abnormal findings, but hemorrhagic infarction was detected on the 3rd day after the onset. Follow-up CT showed subcortical low density area, hemorrhagic infarction with perifocal brain edema, midline shift etc; the focus of hemorrhagic infarction was almost absorbed 2.5 months after the onset. Cerebral angiogram showed not only the obstruction of the superior sagittal sinus but also that of cortical veins of cerebral convexity at first. Follow-up angiogram showed the development of collateral circulations such as deep cerebral, ophthalmic and emissary veins. On CBF study, low rCBF at the bilateral parasagittal region was observed, but marked increase of rCBF was measured in the parasagittal region, especially at the site of hemorrhagic infarction after the administration of 20% mannitol. We, therefore, consider mannitol as an effective agent for the treatment of cerebral sino-venous thrombosis.
