Intracranial complications of sinusitis (ICS) (cerebral, epidural, and subdural abscesses, meningitis, and dural sinus thrombophlebitis) remain a challenging and contemporary topic. The progressive pneumatization and continued development of the sinuses after birth and the late appearance of the frontal and sphenoid sinuses imply that some infections would not appear until later childhood. We reviewed the records at a large pediatric hospital between 1986 and 1995 and found 10 children with 13 ICS (cerebral abscess, 5; extra-axial empyema, 5; and meningitis, 3). Of 43 children with cerebral abscess and 16 with extra-axial abscesses treated in this period, 12% of cerebral and 63% of extra axial abscesses were due to a sinogenic source. Multiple intracranial and extracranial complications of sinusitis in a single patient were common. The average age of children with ICS was 12.2 years old. We present these 10 cases and discuss their presentation, microbiology, and clinical course. Although the majority presented with a classic picture of headache, altered mental status, and fever, a few had symptoms that were more subtle. One child had recurrent meningitis, believed to be due to skull base dehiscence after endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). He has required multiple otolaryngologic and neurosurgical procedures in an effort to prevent further episodes of meningitis. Ultimately, nine of 10 patients survived with an average hospital stay of 27.8 days (median of 17 days). The diagnosis of ICS requires a high index of suspicion, imaging of the brain and paranasal sinuses, and aggressive intervention.
