Magnetic resonance (MR) angiography is a new, noninvasive imaging method with well-known uses in adults for the evaluation of carotid disease in the neck and cerebral vasculopathy. MR angiography examinations were prospectively studied in 126 children to evaluate the usefulness of MR angiography of the head and neck in children, as well as to correlate its findings with those of conventional angiography. Eleven patients underwent conventional angiography in addition to MR angiography. MR angiography was performed with commercially available pulse sequences and included two- and three-dimensional time-of-flight and phase-contrast techniques. Indications for MR angiography included evaluation of pathologic conditions (aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations, infarcts, venous sinus thrombosis, brain tumors, and cerebritis), screening examinations in sickle cell disease, and follow-up of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. MR angiography was found to be a useful, noninvasive diagnostic and screening examination for head and neck and cerebral vascular abnormalities in children and had excellent correlation with conventional angiography.
