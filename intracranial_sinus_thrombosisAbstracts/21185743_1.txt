We report a 55-year-old man with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis presenting as acute subdural hematoma. He was treated with an intravenous infusion of heparin sodium and the occluded superior sagittal sinus was recanalized. According to our literature review, acute subdural hematoma caused by cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is relatively rare, and only a single case has reported thus far. We speculate that dehydration was the reason for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in the present case, and the sudden rise in intracranial pressure in addition to hemodynamic stress caused by cerebral venous sinus thrombosis resulted in the collapse of a bridging vein and caused an acute subdural hematoma.
