The prognosis of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is variable, and outcome may range from complete recovery to death. Prognostic factors to predict outcome in the acute phase of CVST have not been analysed in a prospective study. Prognostic factors in patients enrolled in a clinical treatment trial were prospectively investigated. Poor outcome after 12 weeks, defined as death or dependency (Oxford handicap score > or =3), was used as the principle outcome measure. Univariate relations between possible prognostic factors and outcome at 12 weeks were analyzed with chi(2) tests. Treatment and all factors associated with prognosis (p< or = 0.25) were forced into a logistic regression model with a forward selection procedure. Fifty nine patients (50 women, nine men) were studied, with a mean age of 37 years (range 18 to 80 years). After 12 weeks 10 patients (17%) had a poor outcome. The univariate identified factors related to poor outcome were papilloedema, altered consciousness, coma, age older than 33 years, diagnostic delay < or =10 days, intracerebral haemorrhage, and involvement of the straight sinus. Isolated intracranial hypertension and a delta sign on CT were associated with good outcome. In the multivariate analysis coma and cerebral haemorrhage were significantly associated with a poor outcome, with odds ratios of 8.2 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1. 3-50.1) and 20.7 (95% CI 1.6-264.3) respectively. Involvement of the straight sinus was also weakly, but not significantly, associated with poor outcome. In conclusion, coma and intracerebral haemorrhage are independent predictors for poor outcome of CVST.
