In three patients with clinically unsuspected diagnosis, MRI has afforded a positive and conspicuous demonstration of dural sinus thrombosis, allowing specific treatment and followed by improvement in the patients' condition. Even in retrospect, CT examinations were nondiagnostic. Presenting symptoms were usual and nonspecific. CT and radionuclide scanning have proved valuable when performed on a clinically oriented basis. Angiography cannot be carried out without clear indications. MRI offers advantages in being a non-invasive technique without ionising radiation, allowing direct visualization and accurate delineation of the thrombus. MRI is definitely the method of choice to assess clinically suspected cerebral venous occlusion. As MRI diagnosis relies on a routine examination protocol, we believe that it will detect other unsuspected cases of dural sinus thrombosis.
