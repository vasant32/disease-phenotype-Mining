The incidence of dural sinus thrombosis (DST) appears to be on the rise. This is most probably due to an increased awareness as well as the earlier detection by computerized tomography (CT). Computerized tomography has emerged as the radiological screening procedure of choice and may in fact be the only investigation necessary. The CT scans should be done without and with contrast enhancement. A number of signs have been described; some are pathognomonic while others are nonspecific. As CT is relatively noninvasive, follow up scans at appropriate intervals can be done in patients suspected of having DST. CT can also aid in the understanding of its evolution and can prognosticate its outcome. Angiography is only reserved for a selected few where diagnosis proves difficult. We report our experience of 13 patients with DST.
