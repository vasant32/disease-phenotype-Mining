The purpose of the study was to enhance the efficiency of early diagnosis of orbital phlegmon, by examining its clinical picture and using instrumental studies. Sixty-three patients with orbital phlegmon were treated at hospital in 1985 to 2007. Its diagnosis employed ultrasound and X-ray studies. Orbital phlegmon was diagnosed in 30 patients with orbital injury and 33 patients with inflammatory diseases of the eyelids, face, nasal sinuses, and infection metastasis from septic foci. The disease was characterized by intoxication syndrome, eyelid inflammatory changes, chemosis, exophthalmos, and ophthalmoplegia. The following complications: neuritis, optic nerve ischemia, meningoencephalitis, brain abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and sepsis were observed. Ultrasound and X-ray (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) studies provide the diagnosis of the disease in early periods and timely medical and surgical treatments.
