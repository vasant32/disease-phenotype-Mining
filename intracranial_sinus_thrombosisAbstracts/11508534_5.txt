A retrograde ventriculosinus (RVS) shunt is a watertight connection that delivers excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) against the direction of blood flow. This method of CSF shunting utilizes the impact pressure (IP) of the bloodstream in the SSS to maintain the intraventricular pressure (IVP) more than the sinus pressure (SP) regardless of changes in posture or intrathoracic pressure (ITP) and discourages stagnation and clotting of blood at the venous end of the connection. It also utilizes collapse of the internal jugular vein (IJV) in the erect posture to prevent siphonage. During the past 8 years, 50 RVS shunts were successfully implanted using valveless shunting catheters. There were no problems related to incorrect CSF drainage or sinus thrombosis. The results indicated arrest of the hydrocephalic process, normalization of the IVP and proper shunt function.
