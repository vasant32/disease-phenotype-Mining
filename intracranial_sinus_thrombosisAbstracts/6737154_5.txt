Six full-term severely asphyxiated newborn infants underwent evaluation with digital intravenous angiography. All infants were comatose and flaccid and had seizures, depressed brainstem function, and signs of intracranial hypertension. An initial brain CT scan revealed diffuse hypodensities and compressed ventricles. Follow-up noncontrast CT scans showed areas of increased attenuation. Digital intravenous angiography demonstrated venous sinus thrombosis in five infants, two of whom also had arterial thrombosis, and hypervascularity in the sixth infant. Our data document that occlusive vascular disease is a prominent feature of severe perinatal asphyxia.
