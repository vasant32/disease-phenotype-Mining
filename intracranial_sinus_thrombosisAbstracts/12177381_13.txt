The etiology of neonatal sinovenous thrombosis is poorly understood. The authors report the risk factors and radiologic features of neonatal sinovenous thrombosis seen over an 11-year period. Of 30 patients, 29% received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment, and 23% had congenital heart disease. Genetic thrombophilias were present in four of the seven infants tested. Eighteen neonates had multiple maternal, neonatal, perinatal, or prothrombotic complications. Sinovenous thrombosis was often accompanied by infarction (50%) or intraventricular hemorrhage (33%).
