The presentation of cavernous sinus thrombosis can be ominous and, in many cases, lead to death or serious morbidity. Infections from the face can tract via a valveless venous system in a retrograde manner to the cavernous sinus. A case of cavernous sinus thrombosis secondary to a non-operable posterior maxillary sinus wall fracture is reported. This case is of interest because the inciting factor was a fracture in the posterior maxillary wall that created a tract from which bacteria traveled to the pterygoid plexus and, ultimately, to the cavernous sinus. Although cavernous sinus thrombosis is uncommon, we present this case to remind medical and dental professionals of the potential complications of infection and trauma to the face, especially in immunocompromised patients.
