Bezold's abscess and sigmoid sinus thrombosis are both classic complications of otitis media. However, since the introduction of antibiotics both have become very rare. Very few cases of these complications occurring concomitantly have been reported. We describe the clinical case of a 45 year old male with a 10 year history of neglected right ear cholesteatoma. The patient presented to our department with a 10 day history of purulent right otorrhea, otalgia, increasing headach, pyrexia and suppurating right parapharyngeal mass. CT scan confirmed right middle ear cholesteatoma associated with ipsilateral Bezold abscess and and sigmoid sinus thrombosis. Treatment was by mastoidectomy, broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics and anticoagulation. The patient made a full uncomplicated recovery. The association between chronic middle ear disease, sigmoid sinus thrombosis and Bezold abscess are discussed.
