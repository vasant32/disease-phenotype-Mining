Acute otitis media is a widespread disease affecting all ages. The introduction of antibiotics has led to a reduction in the incidence of complications from approx. 17% to 1%. Nevertheless, life-threatening complications still occur. The present paper describes the course and treatment of mastoiditis, petrositis and sepsis, as well as intracranial complications, i.e. meningitis, sigmoid sinus thrombosis, extradural abscess, subdural empyema, brain abscess and otitic hydrocephalus. The importance of antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media and the need to assess treatment outcomes are emphasised.
