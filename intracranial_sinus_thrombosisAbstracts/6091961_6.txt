Dural sinus thrombosis developed in a young man with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). His neurological disorder developed in the face of anemia and a urinary tract infection. Progressive neurological deterioration occurred in spite of anticoagulation, antibiotic and steroid therapy. The propensity to develop cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis in PNH may be due to release of thromboplastin material from hemolyzed red blood cells, the interaction of complement with red blood cells and platelets, or from increased sensitivity to platelet aggregation.
