Exophthalmos and clinical signs of heart failure occurred sporadically in 3- to 12-month-old cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) in a colony originally derived from three male and four female littermates. Macroscopic lesions in severely affected animals included subcutaneous edema, hydrothorax, right ventricular dilatation, unilateral or bilateral atrial thrombosis, and exophthalmos. Hearts from 17 cotton rats that were found dead or were euthanatized because of exophthalmos or dyspnea and 33 control cotton rats were examined microscopically. Myocardial lesions were present in 46 of 46 cotton rats > or = 1 month of age and consisted of multifocal cardiac myocyte necrosis, mineralization, and mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltration. Cotton rats > 5 months of age also had foci of interstitial fibrosis and myocyte atrophy. Twelve of 24 (50%) necropsied cotton rats had chronic pulmonary congestion, and livers from eight of 24 (33%) had chronic periacinar congestion and atrophy. Thrombi were present in one or both cardiac atria in nine of 50 (18%) hearts, and in at least one orbital venous sinus in 14 of 24 (58%) necropsied cotton rats and in 12 of 14 (86%) with exophthalmos. Exophthalmos in this colony of cotton rats appears to have resulted predominantly from orbital venous sinus thrombosis caused by stasis of venous blood secondary to right heart failure associated with a heritable cardiomyopathy.
