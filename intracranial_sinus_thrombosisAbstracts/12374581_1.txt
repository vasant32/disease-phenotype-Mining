The authors present serial magnetic resonance (MR) images of an infant with cardiac failure and generalized cerebral venous dilation, which was initially misdiagnosed in the first week of life on cranial ultrasound as a vein of Galen malformation. At 3 months of age, repeat MR imaging demonstrated complete resolution of this marked cerebral venous distension with no evidence for cerebral injury. This case illustrates the value of MR in the identification of this disorder and its distinction from more serious conditions, such as vein of Galen malformation and venous sinus thrombosis. Complete resolution of the venous dilation and the lack of definable parenchymal injury suggest a good prognosis for this disorder.
