Thrombosis of the cerebral dural sinuses and veins has been described since the early 19th century. Clinically the process is characterised by diverse symptomatology and physical findings and in spite of advances in diagnostic radiological techniques it remains an under-recognised condition. It has been most commonly associated with sepsis, trauma, pregnancy, the puerperium and many other hypercoagulable states. We describe an apparently unique case of sagittal sinus thrombosis occurring during an ectopic pregnancy. This was subsequently complicated by intracranial hypertension in spite of clinical improvement and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence suggesting a return of venous patency. The clinical presentation, radiological features and management is discussed.
