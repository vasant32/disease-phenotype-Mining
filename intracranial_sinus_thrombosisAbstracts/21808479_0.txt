A 35-year-old businessman with a history of migraine with aura developed new neck pain while lying on a sofa in his home. He was given neck massage and physical therapy for a day, and subsequently after two days developed severe generalized headache when sitting or standing. He was hospitalized in his hometown. Investigations revealed venous sinus thrombosis and bilateral thin subdural collections for which he was anticoagulated. Headache improved and then worsened and became severe in all positions. He was then admitted under our care. MRI scan of the brain at our hospital showed left subdural hematoma with midline shift. It required urgent evacuation. His previous first brain MRI was re-evaluated. It showed characteristic features of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH). If not recognized early, SIH results in various complications, some of which require immediate intervention. Any change in the pattern of headache in SIH one must alert the clinician due to the possibility of one of its complications.
