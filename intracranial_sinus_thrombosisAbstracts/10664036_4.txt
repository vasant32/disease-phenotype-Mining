Antimicrobial agents have greatly reduced the incidence of intracranial complications of infections of the middle ear and mastoid. Too many prescriptions and overconsumption of antibiotics when otitis media is suspected has caused resistance to many antibiotics, leading to a pronounced and justifiable desire to reduce the widespread excessive use of antibiotics. The possible untoward consequences of a too restricted antibiotic policy, however, is illustrated by the following case of a 14-year-old boy who, after non-treatment of an ear infection, fell ill with one-sided headache and vomiting caused by a lateral sinus thrombosis. After intravenous treatment with antibiotics, anticoagulants and ventilation of the middle ear, the infection was cured without complications. This case calls attention to the symptoms of otitic complications arising outside the temporal bone. The physician must always bear in mind the possibility of an unusual event. The general treatment of endocranial complications is outlined, giving details of the treatment given in this special case. We stress that one should not be too cautious in prescribing antibiotics in otitis media.
