With an ultra low field magnetic resonance imager (ULF-MRI) operating at 0.02 Tesla we describe a case of increased signal intensity from the transverse and sigmoid sinuses of the brain. A comparison with radionuclide angiography and skull computer tomography is made. The difficulties in differentiating low blood flow and venous thrombosis is also discussed.
