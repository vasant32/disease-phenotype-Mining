A patient with sinus thrombosis and characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, who was managed successfully by barbiturate therapy is reported. MRI showed massive high intensity lesions on T2-weighted image which indicated venous cerebral infarction and brain oedema. Intravenous infusion of thiopental decreased increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The effectiveness of barbiturate therapy is discussed in terms of the similarity between this case and experimental sinus thrombosis. Barbiturate therapy should be considered in cases of severe sinus thrombosis with elevated ICP.
