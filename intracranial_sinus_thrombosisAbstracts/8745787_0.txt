Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis is a serious infective condition with a high mortality and morbidity. We report the first case to our knowledge of septic cavernous sinus thrombosis following manipulation of fractured nasal bone under general anaesthesia. The patient later developed complications of pneumonia with pleural effusion, a vegetative lesion of the mitral valve, and blindness.
