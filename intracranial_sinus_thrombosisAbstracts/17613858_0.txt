Cavernous sinus thrombosis may occur as a secondary threatening condition to spread from local or distant foci of infection. We report a case where secondary retrograde spread occurred to both the ipsilateral and contralateral orbits with very different clinical manifestations. To our knowledge such spread is unreported. The case highlights the difficulty in recognising orbital collections when venous engorgement secondary to a cavernous sinus thrombosis coexists and demonstrates how the prognosis has been improved through antibiotics, anticoagulation and timely surgical intervention.
