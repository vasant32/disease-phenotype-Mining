Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is a rare fungal infection of the nasal cavity and sinuses that can spread to the orbits and cranium within days. Its presentation can be confused with those of sinusitis, viral infections, diabetic ketoacidosis, or carotid sinus thrombosis, and it is often missed at early presentation. Survival is directly linked to early detection and treatment. We present a case of rhinocerebral mucormycosis and discuss the literature on its early signs and symptoms, pathophysiology, and treatment options.
