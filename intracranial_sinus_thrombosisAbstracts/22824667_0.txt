Because of the rarity of dural sinus thrombosis in children with polycythaemia vera (PV), the options for diagnosis and treatment remain elusive. A 12-year-old girl was admitted with dural sinus thrombosis associated with PV, diagnosed by magnetic resonance venography. She was managed  with interventional endovascular thrombolectomy and venoplasty, phlebotomy, hydroxyurea, low molecular weight heparin, and aspirin followed by warfarin. She made a good recovery without residual neurological deficit. This case highlights the importance of diagnosis and appropriate intervention  with multi-modality treatments in patients with PV and thrombosis.
