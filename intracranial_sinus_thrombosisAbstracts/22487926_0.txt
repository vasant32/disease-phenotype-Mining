 OBJECTIVES: To present a rare case of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND INTERVENTION: A 43-year-old woman presented with coma and was diagnosed as a case of CVST. She recovered in a few days with heparin treatment. Many possible risk factors for CSVT were negative in the patient but intermittent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea was accidentally noticed. Cerebral computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were done. The patient was diagnosed as having spontaneous intermittent CSF rhinorrhea due to a defect in the base of the skull. CONCLUSIONS: This case showed the importance of being aware that a defect in the base of the skull may lead to intermittent CSF rhinorrhea in patients with CVST.
