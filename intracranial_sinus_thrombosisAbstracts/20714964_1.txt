PURPOSE: Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) has a wide spectrum of symptoms and is therefore difficult to diagnose. CVT has been reported to be associated with various etiologies. There are, however, very few reported cases of CVT associated with iron deficiency anemia (IDA), especially in adults. CASE REPORT: We reported the case of a female patient with seizure and hemorrhagic infarction due to sagittal sinus thrombosis. She had severe hypochromic microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency, and had a good prognosis after iron supplementation and oral anticoagulation therapy. CONCLUSION: The present case indicates that iron deficiency is a risk factor for CVT.
