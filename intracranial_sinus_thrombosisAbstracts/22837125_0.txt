Cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT) is increasingly diagnosed in neonates. Despite many studies which have addressed diagnosis and management of pediatric CSVT, diagnosis of CVSD in neonates is difficult. A female neonate born by natural vaginal delivery was diagnosed with CSVT after initiation of seizure. The seizure was stabilized and after performing diagnostic tests, the diagnosis of CSVT was made. This report describes diagnosis of this rare condition in a newborn baby in order to make awareness about this serious condition in neonates.
