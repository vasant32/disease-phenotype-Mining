Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare but potentially serious disorder in children. There is no literature on the long-term neuropsychological and emotional sequelae and implications for quality of life. We studied 17 children who had CVST after the neonatal period, aged between 1 month and 16 years at the time of CVST (mean age at CVST was 6 years, median 4 years 8 months). Five children died during follow-up. The cause of death was related to CVST in one child. Twelve children participated in a clinical follow-up assessment. Mean follow-up was 2 years 8 months. One child had physical sequelae with impairment of skilled movement. All children had average or high intelligence scores. Two children with CVST due to an uncomplicated mastoiditis had mild cognitive deficits: one child had difficulty with written language; the other had diminished cognitive efficiency with concentration and attention problems associated with decreased psychosocial functioning. Decreased physical well-being was reported in three of 12 children. We conclude that children who had survived CVST had a fair prognosis. Most had normal cognitive and physical development, although mild cognitive deficits or decreased physical and psychosocial well-being can occur.
