We present a case of septic transverse/sigmoid sinus thrombosis imaged with gadopentetate dimeglumine enhanced magnetic resonance (MR). The appearance of the septic thrombus was atypical and did not conform to the usual blood degradation products probably because of the septic nature of the process. Enhanced T1-weighted images demonstrate both the "delta" sign and the tentorial enhancement as previously seen with contrast enhanced CT. Surgical correlation was obtained and helps to account for the appearance of the clot on MR.
