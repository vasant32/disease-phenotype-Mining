PURPOSE: To raise awareness of the importance of prompt and appropriate imaging in patients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. METHODS: Case report with diagnostic tests and discussion of management options. RESULTS: A 15-year-old girl presenting with bilateral optic disc swelling was noted to have extensive thrombosis of intracerebral venous sinuses with the clot extending along the internal jugular vein as inferior as the root of the neck demonstrable on magnetic resonance venography. CONCLUSIONS: Ophthalmologists should be vigilant in obtaining appropriate imaging in cases of optic disc swelling.
