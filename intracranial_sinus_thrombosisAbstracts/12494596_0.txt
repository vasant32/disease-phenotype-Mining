Rhinogenous complications may manifest in the region of the orbits, bone or soft parts of the wall of the frontal sinus, or endocranially. With regard to orbital complications, a differentiation is made between edema, periostitis, subperiosteal abscess and phlegmon--depending on severity and extent. A possible sequela of frontal sinusitis may be osteomyelitis. If the frontal bone is involved, there is a danger that the infection may spread to the endocranium via medullary spaces and blood vessels. The diagnostic basis for deciding appropriate treatment is CT or MRI. While orbital edema and periostitis usually respond to conservative treatment, subperiosteal abscess, orbital phlegmon and abscess of the brain require immediate operative treatment under antibiotic cover. The treatment of choice for osteomyelitis of the frontal bone is the liberal removal of affected bone, also under antibiotic cover.
