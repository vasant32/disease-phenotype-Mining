SIH is an underdiagnosed condition with variable clinical and radiological presentations that leads to engorged dural sinuses and promotes stasis predisposing for dural sinus thrombosis (DST). We describe a young female patient who presented with clinical and imaging signs of SIH alone followed by a superimposed DST 10 days later. We discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms that may have led to this constellation, and review the literature to-date along with diagnostic and management implications.
