PURPOSE: To determine the ability of transtemporal power- and frequency-based transcranial color-coded duplex sonography to aid in the assessment of cerebral veins and sinuses, as well as to provide reference data for flow direction and velocity. METHODS: Using a color duplex device equipped with a 2.0/2.5-MHz sector scan, we insonated 120 healthy volunteers and three patients with cerebral venous thrombosis. RESULTS: In subjects 20 to 59 years old, deep middle cerebral veins were identified in 88%, basal veins in 97%, straight sinuses in 60%, and transverse sinuses in 42%. The corresponding values for subjects 60 to 79 years old were 53%, 86%, 23%, and 20%, respectively. Velocities were highest in transverse and straight sinuses, slower in basal veins, and slowest in deep middle cerebral veins. Flow was directed lateromedially in the deep middle cerebral vein, rostrocaudally in the basal vein and straight sinus, and mediolaterally in the transverse sinus. Two patients with straight sinus thromboses showed reversed flow direction in the basal veins, and one patient with superior sagittal sinus thrombosis showed elevated velocities in a deep middle cerebral vein. CONCLUSION: Transtemporal power- and frequency-based color-coded duplex sonography enabled imaging and velocity measurements in deep cerebral veins in subjects 20 to 59 years old, but detection of the straight and transverse sinuses was low. In older subjects, only the basal vein was regularly assessed.
