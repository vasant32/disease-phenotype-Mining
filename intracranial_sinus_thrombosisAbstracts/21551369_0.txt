To investigate the impact of anticoagulation on short-term outcome (1 month) in neonates with cerebral sinovenous thrombosis, the authors conducted a retrospective chart review of neonates admitted to 2 tertiary hospitals over a 5- and 8-year period, respectively. Neonates with confirmed radiographic evidence of cerebral sinovenous thrombosis were included. Eighteen total patients treated with hydration only were identified. Approximately 50% of these neonates showed clot extension or other complications on follow-up imaging that were obtained within 72 hours with either magnetic resonance imaging or computed topography. Five neonates were treated with anticoagulation, and none of these patients developed new infarcts or hemorrhages. The results of this retrospective study suggest that anticoagulation is safe in neonates with cerebral sinovenous thrombosis. Early follow-up scans can help treatment decision. Larger studies are needed to develop standardized guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of neonatal cerebral sinovenous thrombosis.
