The authors report a case of sino-venous thrombosis occurring in the course of trichinella infection in a 43 year-old man. MRI and angio-MRI showed a right rolandic haemorrhagic infarct and thrombosis of the superior sagittal and left lateral sinuses. Sino-venous thrombosis in such infection appears to be extremely rare. We found 4 reported cases which we compared to the present case. The findings of sino-venous thrombosis in relation with neurotrichinosis is examined.
