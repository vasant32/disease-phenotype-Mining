A case is presented of Aspergillus fumigatus granuloma involving the sphenoid sinus, sella turcica, cavernous sinus, and the internal carotid artery. The diagnosis was established by a transsphenoidal biopsy. The infection proved difficult to treat and finally remitted after chemotherapy with a combination of amphotericin B, rifampin (rifampicin), and flucytosine (5-fluorocytosine). The spectrum of aspergillosis of the central nervous system is reviewed, and difficulties in treating this infection are considered.
