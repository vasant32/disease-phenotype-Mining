Acute infection the paranasal sinus is a rather frequent pathology in children. On the contrary, local orbital complications are rare. The employment of antibiotics reduces the incidence of complications but can sometimes conceal their appearance so that diagnosis is delayed. Orbital as well as intracranial complications of ethmoidal and maxillary sinusitis are most often encountered in childhood. Within a brief time span, 8 patients with complicated frontal and ethmoid-maxillary sinusitis were diagnosed and treated: 4 cases of periorbital cellulitis, 2 of subperiorbital abscess and 2 of orbital abscess (one of which with cavernous sinus thrombosis). Particularly relevant from the diagnostic point of view was the employment of C.T. scan which furnished an accurate definition of the orbit and its surrounding structures which influenced treatment choice. Under antibiotic cover all patients but one (who had been treated very early and had responded immediately to intensive antibiotic therapy) were treated surgically and the clinical course of the disease showed significant improvement very shortly after surgical drainage.
