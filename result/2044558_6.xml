<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were correlated with the findings of precordial echocardiography, catheterization and surgical inspection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clear advantages of transoesophageal imaging over precordial imaging include: (1) direct identification of atrial appendage <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients; (2) delineation of systemic and pulmonary venous connections; (3) atrial baffle function (eight patients); (4) better evaluation of the Fontan-type circulation (five patients); (5) improved morphologic assessment of the atrioventricular junction and valves (29 patients); (6) definition of subaortic obstruction (18 patients); and (7) definition of ascending aortic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and supravalvar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> (13 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The problems encountered with transoesophageal imaging include: (1) limited imaging planes; (2) poor visualization of specific intracardiac regions (antero-apical trabecular septum, right ventricular outflow tract); (3) flow masking behind implanted intracardiac prosthetic material </plain></SENT>
