<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many important genes were localized or characterized recently: genes for in cystic <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, NF-2, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043346" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">xeroderma pigmentosum</z:e>, to name a few </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also, in the past 15 months, the CFTR gene affected in cystic <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> has been isolated, the first disease gene to be isolated without use of previous cytogenetic clues, such as deletions or translocations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other examples should follow, although we have been disappointed to date by the difficulties encountered in the isolation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's disease</z:e> gene which was localized a number of years ago to distal chromosome 4p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is still very difficult to isolate a disease gene without critical cytogenetic information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>New improved techniques for finding the desired expressed sequences in a large cloned segment of human DNA are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our ability to find mutant alleles of a given sequence has expanded greatly with the recent technical advances in denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, chemical cleavage, and single-stranded conformational electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One would predict that information derived from the human genome project will have a major impact upon the isolation of further disease genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As whole regions of human chromosomes or indeed entire chromosomes are physically mapped and cloned as continuous, overlapping YACs (yeast artificial chromosomes), isolation of disease genes will become easier and easier.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
