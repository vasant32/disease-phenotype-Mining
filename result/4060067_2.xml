<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A recent report claimed that an <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> in human skin (believed to be pyridinoline) was deficient in specimens from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> (AAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Further studies suggest that this work was erroneous in two respects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, the <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> has been isolated and partially characterized; the major component of the peak of interest is a deoxyanalogue of pyridinoline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It may be a collagen cross-link of some biologic importance, because it is not detectable in skin from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Second, further studies in an additional 19 patients with AAA and an additional 13 controls suggest that this <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> is abnormally abundant in skin from patients with AAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This difference cannot be accounted for by any potential source of artifact that has been traceable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effects of age, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, sex, race, site of biopsy, and source of specimen (autopsy versus surgery) have been studied; none of these variables can account for the high ratio of pyridinolines to hydroxylysine found in skin from patients with AAA </plain></SENT>
