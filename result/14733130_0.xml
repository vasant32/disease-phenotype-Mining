<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> advanced markedly during the 20th century </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The surgical approach to rhegmatogenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> was first established by Joules Gonin, and treatment of traction <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> by vitrectomy was developed by Robert Machemer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although favorable outcomes are obtained in most cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> using current vitreoretinal surgical techniques, several special types of complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> can be refractory to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The biologic mechanism and the strategy for treatment of a complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> will be discussed in this lecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A discrepancy in the length between the retina and the outer shell, specifically in the extension of the sclera or shortening of the retina, is commonly seen in refractory cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To correct this, shortening of the sclera should be the primary treatment approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relaxing retinotomy should not be a primary procedure in most cases, since retinotomy encourages further shortening of the retina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Equal extension of the scleral wall is frequently seen in eyes with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000557'>buphthalmos</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000592'>blue sclera</z:hpo>, and the discrepancy is corrected by equal shortening of the sclera by encircling and not by focal shortening of the sclera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unequal extension of the sclera occurs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">posterior staphyloma</z:e> in highly myopic eyes, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549307" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">morning glory syndrome</z:e>, and posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0000589'>coloboma</z:hpo> of the choroid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Focal expansion of the posterior sclera should be corrected by placement of a posterior buckle or circumferential lamellar scleral resection and shortening in the same quadrant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Circumferential surgical shortening of the sclera is also indicated in extreme shortening of the retina in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001493'>congenital retinal folds</z:hpo> with persistent fetal vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In cases with associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> folds, radial surgical shortening of the sclera or radial buckling of the sclera corresponding to the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> fold is indicated, and retinotomy must be avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In comparison, in the presence of the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> shortening and folding that develops postnatally in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e>, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, and incontinentia pigment, spontaneous release of the shortening can be expected following surgical removal of the preretinal fibrous tissue, and associated encircling procedures can be effective in selected cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Inadequate surgical procedures such as creation of multiple iatrogenic <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> breaks to remove extensive subretinal tissue, excessive photocoagulation for <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> angiomatous lesions, and inadequate indications for vitrectomy to treat a special form of rhegmatogenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> frequently result in the most complicated form of traction <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A large circumferential retinotomy is beneficial rather than multiple small breaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Penetrating diathermy through a lamellar scleral flap and encircling carries less risk of inducing traction <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> compared with excessive photocoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>For oral breaks or ciliary epithelial breaks commonly seen with blunt ocular trauma or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001047'>atopic dermatitis</z:hpo>, a scleral implant more anterior to the extraocular muscle insertion combined with separate encircling is safer and more effective than primary vitrectomy </plain></SENT>
