<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We experienced four cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002622'>dissecting aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, in which two staged operations were performed with satisfactory results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The operations performed in the four patients were the replacement of the ascending aorta, transverse aortic arch and the entire descending thoracic aorta in DeBakey type I <z:hpo ids='HP_0002622'>dissecting aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>, replacement of the entire descending thoracic and abdominal aorta in type IIIb, replacement of the aortic valve, ascending aorta, transverse aortic arch, the entire descending thoracic and upper abdominal aorta in type I, and replacement of the total aorta including the aortic valve in type II + IIIb, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, but a 42-year-old woman with DeBakey type IIIb died suddenly 2 years 11 months after the second operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was presumed to be due to rupture of a dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (DeBakey type II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002622'>Dissecting aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> must be observed carefully and corrected surgically, because the lesion is progressive and the residual dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> usually dilates eventually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In view of our clinical results, we conclude that the operation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002622'>dissecting aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> should be performed as extensively as possible </plain></SENT>
