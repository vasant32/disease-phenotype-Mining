<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, there is a paucity of data regarding intervention criteria for surgery of the dissected thoraco-abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 22 Marfan's patients with distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> managed between September 1999 and April 2006 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial diameters and linear expansion rates were calculated from imaging studies and the outcome of intervention was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 14/22 male patients (median age 38 years), and 18 had prior aortic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgery was recommended in 20 patients and undertaken in 19 (1 died prior to operation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the operated patients, 2 presented with rupture, 2 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">airway obstruction</z:e>, 1 with intermittent <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> and 14 underwent planned surgery for increased expansion rate or pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had residual type A or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type B dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median aortic dimension at surgery was 6.7 cm (interquartile range (IQR) 5.5-8.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The preoperative mean expansion rate increased from 0.5 cm/year to 1.7 cm/year (p&lt;0.001), prior to operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients underwent Crawford Extent II, two underwent Extent I and two underwent Extent III repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and CSF drainage was used in 16 and 18 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no early mortality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At a median postoperative follow-up of 56 months (range 6-86), the survival of the operated cohort was 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thoraco-<z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> repair in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> can be performed with good outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Intervention should be based on size or accelerated expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Any role of endovascular management needs careful consideration </plain></SENT>
