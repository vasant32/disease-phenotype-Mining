<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our institution performed an orthotopic heart transplantation in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The immediate postoperative course was complicated with ultimate discharge; however, this patient died within 1 year as a result of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the basis of our experience, we surveyed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> heart transplant centers listed with the North American Transplant Coordinator Organization for other patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> who had been referred for transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nearly one third of responding centers evaluated a total of 30 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, only 13 were formally listed for a donor organ and 11 underwent heart transplantation with an operative mortality of 9.1% (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Posttransplantation morbidity was significant and includes a 40% (n = 4) incidence of thoracic aorta dissection (one fatal) in operative survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were three other non-dissection-related late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> for an overall survival of 54.4% after a mean follow-up of 33.0 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this shared experience, it appears that the known vascular complications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> may diminish the anticipated results after heart transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reluctance to place these patients on heart transplant donor waiting lists can be justified </plain></SENT>
