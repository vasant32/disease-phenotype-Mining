<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Aortic wall stress has been shown to increase locally at the convex aspect of the ascending tract when axial root motion is increased, as occurs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study aim was to assess the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins involved in stress-induced vascular remodeling in the convexity and the concavity of <z:mp ids='MP_0010470'>dilated ascending aortas</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Aortic wall specimens, harvested at the convexity and concavity of eight <z:mp ids='MP_0010470'>dilated ascending aortas</z:mp> with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo> underwent morphometry, Western blot, RT-PCR and confocal immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five patients (group A) had congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp>), and three (group B) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specimens from the aorta of three multi-organ donors served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At morphometry, medial degeneration was more severe in the convexity than in the concavity, especially in group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot, RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry disclosed an asymmetric pattern in the expression of some ECM proteins (laminin, tenascin, fibronectin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fibronectin was increased in the convexity of both groups compared to controls at Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry confirmed this pattern only in <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Higher levels of tenascin were found in the convexity in group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The laminin content was greater in the concavity than in the convexity of both groups, but in group B the type of laminin was different, with the beta2 chain particularly expressed, and almost absent in non-Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Type I and type III collagens were more markedly reduced in the convexity than in the concavity in <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In group B, type I collagen was decreased and type III increased, but without any significant difference between the two aspects of the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A tissue remodeling response to valve disease-related wall stress may underlie <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> with <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> regurgitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although morphometry showed similar changes in Marfan aortas, molecular investigations differentiated this condition, qualitatively, from <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
