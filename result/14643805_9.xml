<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such techniques have various names </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Usually 'valve sparing' is used in context with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> or aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> as in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>. 'Aortic valve salvage' tends to be the term of choice for similar surgical reconstruction in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>. 'Aortic valve repair' is often chosen when direct surgical procedures are performed on the leaflets themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the techniques have evolved based upon an increased understanding of the functional <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the aortic root complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The different technical approaches, their applications and results need to be understood by the cardiology community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The failure modes for such techniques are specific and different from prosthetic valve failure modes, but are adequately followed with echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over two-thirds of patients remain free of re-development of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> at 8-10 years following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall patient survival is more dependent upon the underlying cardiovascular status of the patient than the surgical technique itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Perioperative mortalities vary between 0 and 6% and are comparable to composite valve+graft techniques and isolated aortic valve replacement, in which the operative mortality approximates 3.3-4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Long-term results are good to excellent and spare the patient anticoagulation and prosthetic valve disease </plain></SENT>
