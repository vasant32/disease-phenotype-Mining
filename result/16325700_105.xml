<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Important advances have been made in the diagnosis and medical and surgical care of affected individuals, yet substantial morbidity and premature mortality remain associated with this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Progress has been made with genetically defined mouse models to elucidate the pathogenetic sequence that is initiated by fibrillin-1 deficiency </plain></SENT>
