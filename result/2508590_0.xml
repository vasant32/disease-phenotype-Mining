<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was confirmed by histological examination of the aorta and aortography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Functional signs were not always present, since 42 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>100 of patients were in NYHA classes I and II and 58 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>100 in classes III and IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> was 26 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cardiothoracic ratio was increased up to 0.62 +/- 0.07, and projection to the right was noted in 63 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>100 of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sokolow's index was 5 mv or more in 24 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>100 of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The aortic root, measured in 42 patients, was dilated up to 54 +/- 13 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The end-diastolic left ventricular diameter was increased to 70 +/- 10 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Haemodynamic studies yielded the following results: cardiac index 2.33 +/- 0.6 1/min/m2, end-diastolic left ventricular pressure 24.7 +/- 12 mmHg, mean pulmonary wedge pressure 12 +/- 6 mmHg, left ventricular end-diastolic volume 199 +/- 67 ml/m2, and angiographic ejection fraction 53 +/- 12 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The angiographic volume of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, graded according to Sellers' classification, was 3/4 or 4/4 in 89 patients; the maximum diameter of the <z:mp ids='MP_0010470'>dilated ascending aorta</z:mp> was 73 +/- 18 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Evolutive data confirmed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003504" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ai">aortic incompetence</z:e> due to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> is more severe than that due to other causes: 36 months after surgery, the overall mortality rate was 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Only two factors in our series seemed to be predictive of a poor prognosis: the fact that the patient belonged to NYHA class III or IV, and a mean pulmonary wedge pressure above 10 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This, however, must be taken with caution in view of the small population samples studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The value of skin biopsy was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This examination, performed in 27 patients, was compared with the pathological examination of the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Skin biopsy is specific and provides a major argument in favour of dystrophic AI in patients under 40 years of age </plain></SENT>
