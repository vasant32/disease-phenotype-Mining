<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Arterial stiffness is an independent determinant of cardiovascular risk, and there is evidence that it has a strong genetic component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-1 (FBN-1) is the disease gene for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and an FBN-1 polymorphism has been associated with large artery stiffening and elevated pulse pressure (PP) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the possible influence of the common FBN-1 genotypes on arterial stiffness in a large cohort of healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 742 individuals free from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> or risk factors were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIx), blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted, and genotyping for the FBN-1 variable nucleotide tandem repeat (VNTR) was performed using a CEQ 8000 sequencer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age (+/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) of the cohort was 49 +/- 1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The three common VNTR genotypes accounted for 87.1% of the population frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Their frequencies were: 52.3%, 2-2; 16.3%, 2-3; 18.5% 2-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the blood pressure, AIx, PWV, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> or body mass index among the common genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the FBN-1 genotype was not associated with either aortic PWV or other measures of stiffness after correction for other confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data do not support the hypothesis that aortic PWV or PP are influenced by the FBN-1 VNTR genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although we cannot exclude small effects, this negative finding also suggests that there is not a major allele for stiffness or blood pressure in apparently healthy individuals linked to this VNTR </plain></SENT>
