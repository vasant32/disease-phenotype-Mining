<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We have conducted aortic valve-sparing operation for patients having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> and almost <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortic valve leaflets since August 1998, and here report midterm results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with dilated aortic annulus or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> were treated with reimplantation, and the remaining patients with remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Either 24 or 26 mm graft was selected based on aortic annular diameter and leaflet size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aortic valve competence was assessed regularly with echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five patients (age: 29 +/- 13 yr), including 4 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, had undergone reimplantation, and 3 (age: 46 +/- 18 yr) remodeling by December 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 18 (range: 10-32) months, and no postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> has occurred and no reintervention has been required thus far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients in the remodeling group showed only a small pressure gradient through the aortic valve and decreased left ventricular diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two in the reimplantation group showed a pressure gradient exceeding 20 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> patients in the reimplantation group showed slightly increased diastolic left ventricular diameter and 3 slightly increased systolic left ventricular diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> had diminished in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients by discharge, moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> recurred in 1 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> patient in the reimplantation group because of degenerated aortic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although postoperative aortic valve function was not perfect in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing reimplantation, midterm results after aortic valve-sparing operation were generally satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Proper selection of patients, procedures, and graft size was thought to be important to ensure a favorable surgical outcome </plain></SENT>
