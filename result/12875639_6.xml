<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Despite theoretical advantages of antegrade (<z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi>) and retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP) in addition to deep hypothermic arrest (DHA) in aortic arch surgery, there is still controversy about the best method of cerebral protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed our experience with neurological outcome after aortic arch repair over the last five years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-two patients undergoing aortic arch repair were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five patients (8.1%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, 11 (17.7%) had previous cardiac operations, and 13 (21.0%) also received coronary bypass grafting (CABG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The extent of arch replacement was proximal level in 40 (64.5%), distal level in 18 (29.0%), and total in 13 (21.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The method of cerebral protection was DHA alone in 14 patients, DHA with RCP in 23, and DHA with <z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi> in 25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pre-, intra-, and postoperative variables in the three categories of cerebral protection were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the independent predictors of mortality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and temporary neurological dysfunction (TND) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall hospital mortality was 5 (8.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> occurred in 4 patients (6.4%), and TND in 5 (8.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences among the groups in mortality or neurological dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Total brain exclusion time (TBET) was significantly longer in <z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi> (DHA, 25.2+/-12.0 min; <z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi>, 61.8+/-44.1 min; RCP, 36.4+/-20.5 min; p=0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed a trend for TBET of longer than 90 minutes as a predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p=0.06; odds ratio, 7.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival rate was 88.7% at five years (DHA, 85.7%; <z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi>, 80.0%; RCP, 100%; no significant difference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite more complicated arch repairs requiring a significantly longer cerebral exclusion time which were performed in the group receiving <z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi>, there was no significant increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Increasing confidence in the ability of <z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi> has led us to perform the most appropriate arch repair without compromising the extent of replacement for fear of exceeding the "safe" period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
