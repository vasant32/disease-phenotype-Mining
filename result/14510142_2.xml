<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fifty (male = 24; female = 26; age 49.33 +/- 12.16) presumably healthy adult Nigerians were prospectively examined for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> (MVP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed clinical, electrocardiographic (ECG), M-mode echocardiographic (M-mode echo) and two-dimensional echocardiographic (2-D echo) examinations on these subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2-D echos were obtained from parasternal and apical acoustic windows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Parasternal long axis view obtained when the transducer was perpendicular to the chest wall with both mitral valve leaflets and left atrium recorded was considered optimal for studying mitral valve systolic motion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MVP was defined as late or holosystolic bowing of mitral valve leaflet at least 2 mm or 3 mm, respectively, below the C-D line at M-mode echo; or, marked systolic extension of one or both mitral valve leaflets cephalad to the plane of mitral annulus into the left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No subject had classical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's Syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the four subjects with cardiac symptoms, only one had diagnostic MVP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three subjects had mid-to late systolic click following valsalva manouver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven subjects had apical late systolic murmur none of which was louder than grade II/VI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four of them had combined anterior and posterior leaflet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> and one had posterior leaflet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> compatible with diagnostic MVP, thus resulting in 10% prevalence rate of MVP in the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two other subjects with late systolic murmur had no echocardiographic evidence of MVP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three subjects with non-diagnostic mild-to moderate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> of the anterior leaflet alone on 2-D echo had no clinical murmur even though two of them complained of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seven otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects had holosystolic bowing of mitral valve leaflets on M-mode echo but not on 2-D echo and were thus classified into non-diagnostic MVP group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No subject with MVP had serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> on resting ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the prevalence of MVP in presumably healthy adult Nigerians was 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The use of M-mode echo resulted in over-diagnosis, whereas 2-D echo was more accurate in identifying true anatomical and structural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001633'>abnormalities of the mitral valve</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
