<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Impedance and wave reflections were calculated from standard Fourier series analysis of ascending aorta micromanometer pressure and electromagnetic flow records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compliance was estimated by a method recently proposed that uses the area under the pressure-time curve assuming a two-element Windkessel model of the circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurements were made in the baseline state, during vasodilatation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7596">nitroprusside</z:chebi>, after beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with intravenous <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi>, and during vasodilatation after beta-blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> produces alterations from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in some hemodynamic variables: during baseline conditions, the magnitude of wave reflection was higher than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was normalized by vasodilatation and further increased by beta-blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite the greatly <z:mp ids='MP_0011575'>dilated aortic root</z:mp>, the aortic characteristic impedance was in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, suggesting increased aortic wall stiffness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The baseline total arterial compliance was greatly increased with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7596">nitroprusside</z:chebi> and was reduced by beta-blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>beta-Blockade did not decrease the maximum acceleration of blood into the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These are the first detailed measurements of hemodynamic indexes in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> beta-blockade is not necessarily beneficial in reducing hemodynamic loading on an already <z:mp ids='MP_0011575'>dilated aortic root</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
