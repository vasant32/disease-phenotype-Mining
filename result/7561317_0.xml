<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the time of operation, anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the left sinus of Valsalva and near site of the left coronary orifice were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then, composite graft replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve, in which a single graft of 16 mm in diameter was interposed between the coronary ostia and composite graft, was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the left sinus of Valsalva is a rare congenital abnormality </plain></SENT>
