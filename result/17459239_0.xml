<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical efficiency and safety of the iris hooks and modified capsular tension ring (MCTR) for the treatment of subluxation lens in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study comprised 5 patients (7 eyes) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and subluxation lens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 3.2 mm clear cornea incision and continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (<z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi>), 2 - 4 disposable nylon iris hooks were inserted through the stab incisions and placed in the capsulorhexis to support the capsule and enlarged the <z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following irrigation/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>, a MCTR with suture in its eyelet was placed in the capsule bag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After tightening and tying the suture of MCTR, the capsular bag was centered and fixed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A foldable AcrySof one-piece intraocular lens (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e>) was then placed in the capsule bag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve months after the operation, the best corrected visual acuity was &gt;/= 0.8 in six eyes and 0.7 in <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The scheimpflug images obtained from the Pentacam demonstrated that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> were well centered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>UBM showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the MCTR and the haptics of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> were in the capsule bag, the eyelet of the MCTR was rested stably between the capsulorhexis margin and the iris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The retroillumination photograph indicated that only <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> had obvious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1444680" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">posterior capsular opacification</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No intraoperative and postoperative complications such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> of vitreous and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035305" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">retina detachment</z:e> was occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The iris hooks can provide excellent intraoperative capsule-lens stability and facilitate the manipulation during operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MCTR allows additional suture fixation to the eye wall without damaging the capsular bag and maintains the long-term stability of the intraocular lens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, MCTR is helpful for avoiding dislocation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> due to progressive weakening of the zonular fibers in some patients and provides long-term safety </plain></SENT>
