<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that mutations of FBN1 gene or of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta type II receptor may be responsible for its pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the role of TGF-beta signaling pathway in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> has not been comprehensively investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Surgical specimens of the aorta were obtained from two female Marfan patients, and the control aortic tissue was taken from an autopsy of a healthy individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aortic specimens were examined with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin, Masson's trichrome, von Gieson/victoria blue-van Gieson bichrome, and immunohistochemical stainings of TGF-beta1, TGF-beta type I receptor, Smad2/3, Smad4 and Smad7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin staining demonstrated severe elastic lamellar disruption and patchy vascular smooth muscle dissolution in the aortic media of the Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collagen deposition, interlamilar elastic fiber fragmentation, loss or proliferation, and acid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37395">mucopolysaccharide</z:chebi> accumulation were observed in the disarrayed aortic wall structures of Marfan patients by Masson's trichrome, victoria blue-van Gieson bichrome, and Alcian blue and periodic schiff's (AB-<z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>) stainings, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By immunohistochemistry, structural disruptions with enhanced TGF-beta;1 in the cytoplasm, Smad2/3 in the interstices, Smad4 in the cytoplasm, nuclei or interstices, and OOO Smad7, in the nucleus along with attenuated TGF-beta type I receptor in the aortic tissues of Marfan patients in comparison to the healthy control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Marfan patients may have aberrant TGF-beta signaling pathway associated with increased collagen deposition, interlamilar elastic fiber degenerative changes, and acid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37395">mucopolysaccharide</z:chebi> accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The signaling dysregulation may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
