<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 9 men and 3 women aged from 26 to 39 years (mean, 33.0 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and 6 of these patients also had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients had aortic valve replacement plus supracoronary tube graft (Wheat's operation) and the other 9 patients underwent composite tube graft, with Bentall's operation in 3, Cabrol's operation in 2, and the modified Bentall's operation in which prosthetic valve was offset inside the tube graft in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> accounted for an operative mortality of 16.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean aortic cross-clamp time and the amount of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> were less with the modified Bentall's operation than with the other composite tube graft procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This modification seems to decrease the morbidity and to simplify the procedure in treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regular periodic examinations of the patients is needed, especially when <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> is present, in order to detect and surgically correct residual lesions </plain></SENT>
