<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial therapy with <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi> G, in a dose that should have been bactericidal and hence curative according to the results of the initial quantitative antimicrobial studies, became inadequate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The strain of S. viridans displayed considerable variation in both growth properties and antimicrobial sensitivity during the course of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, a different strain of S. viridans was cultured 1 month after treatment had begun </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is therefore important to repeat cultures and antimicrobial sensitivity testing during treatment of infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
