<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A pulsatile mass was present in the left groin and the left leg was pale and pulseless </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT imaging demonstrated the presence of a distal thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (AD) involving the left iliofemoral segment with extravasation of contrast into the left groin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with an urgent femoral-femoral bypass, which repaired the femoral artery and restored perfusion to the left lower extremity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whereas rupture of the aorta into the chest or pericardium is common, femoral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">artery rupture</z:e> complicating AD has not been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This case illustrates the need for peripheral branch intervention when compromised by the dissection process including isolated iliofemoral segments, which are typically benign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Given frank femoral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">artery rupture</z:e>, urgent surgical repair was required and resulted in a satisfactory outcome </plain></SENT>
