<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026267" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PMV">floppy valve syndrome</z:e> is not fully solved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An almost invariable histological finding is the great accumulation of mucinous material in the valve leaflets and constitutes the basis of the valvular theory of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of a mucinous layer in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> valves-- the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">zona</z:e> spongiosa--is not well recognised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To establish the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range of the extent of this zone, 50 excised mitral valves from patients aged 2 to 89 years and who died as a result of road traffic accidents or non-cardiac causes have been analysed by measuring the thickness of the zone in relation to the valve thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A range of 0 to 60 per cent was found and this was not influenced by age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The findings were compared with 50 patients clinically diagnosed as suffering from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026267" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PMV">floppy valve syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A value of over 60 per cent (range 62 to 94%) was found in 43 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increase in the extent of the mucinous material was considered to be a secondary change in the thickened fibrosa which normally accompanies the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026267" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PMV">floppy valve syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Measurements of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">zona</z:e> spongiosa falling within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range were found in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinical features, complications, and accompanying conditions have also been analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Chordal rupture had occurred in 20 patients, infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> in three, and calcification was found in four valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In four patients the aortic valve was also involved and accompanying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> in an additional patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that these patients should not be included in the group of Marfan's forme fruste, nor in the typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026267" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PMV">floppy mitral valve syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Apart from the valvular theory, the myocardial theory in the pathogenesis of the syndrome has been discussed and the components ensuring <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mitral valve function have been reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that an inherent, prominent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">zona</z:e> spongiosa predisposes to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026267" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PMV">floppy valve syndrome</z:e>, particularly if any one of the components of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> valve function is abnormal </plain></SENT>
