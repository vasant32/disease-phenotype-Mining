<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of our patients had intimal disruption caused by trauma; the other had probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos</z:e> type IV syndrome, causing an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection of the descending thoracic aorta and eventually requiring replacement of the aorta from the left subclavian artery to common iliac arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The challenge of treating both the pregnant woman and the fetus was managed successfully by an emergent cesarean section followed by Dacron graft replacement of the descending thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The literature reviewed disclosed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> expansion producing symptoms and dissection is most common during the third trimester and during labor and delivery in patients with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Half of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> in women less than 40 years of age occur in association with pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The available evidence indicates that patients with known valvular or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> should have surgical repairs during the first or second trimester and thereafter have delivery by cesarean section </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> aortic problems near term appear to be better managed by cesarean section followed promptly by treatment of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
