<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of these investigations was to determine the association between cardiac and oculoskeletal abnormalities and to identify specific patterns of disease with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polygraphic tests showed significant changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>: 74% showed the apical systolic click and murmur of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>; 48% had the diastolic murmur of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>; isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> was found in 52%, 26% had isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, and 22% had a combination of the two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic changes were also found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients: 79% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo>; 48% fluttering of the anterior mitral leaflet; 79% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, mostly pansystolic; 34% both mitral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo>; and 34% left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The severities of the cardiac and oculoskeletal abnormalities were not correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> found in these patients, which did not vary with age or sex, was also present in their relatives: mitral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> was present in 38% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo>, with or without regurgitation, in 14% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four of the relatives had clearcut <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, and at least four others a forme fruste </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The metacarpal index was abnormal in 41% of the relatives; ocular abnormalities were rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In kyphoscoliotic patients only an increase in the prevalence of mitral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> (18.2% in women, none in men) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings underline a complex pattern of association between cardiac, ocular, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal abnormalities</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and confirm an appreciable inheritability of several of the markers of the disease </plain></SENT>
