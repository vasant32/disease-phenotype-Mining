<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In infancy before the appearance of the metacarpal epiphyses the index is constant up to about two years of age (5.2 in males and 5.5 in females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During childhood the index rises to reach a peak at about 16 years, and then <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> slightly during adult life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The curves produced are almost identical to those previously found in black children, and one set of values may be used for children of either ethnic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The left hand should be used to calculate the MCI, and the results expressed as either below the mean for age, or in terms of percentile for age above the mean </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Curves are presented showing percentile values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No attempt should be made to produce a clear distinction between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal indices, but the percentile value used in conjunction with other clinical findings in the assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and other skeletal conditions associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
