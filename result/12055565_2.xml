<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1989 and February 1999, 105 patients (83 males, 22 females) who underwent Bentall technique were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preoperative diagnosis was annulo-aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> in 54, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in 27, atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 21, and <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients were affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases, elective, urgent, and emergency were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Button technique was performed and the associated surgical procedures were coronary artery bypass grafting in 21, total aortic arch replacement in 15, proximal hemi arch in 5, and mitral valve replacement in 5 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall hospital mortality rate was 7.6% (n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis using chi(2) and/or two-sample "t"-test showed that dissection, <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture into-pleura or pericardium, emergency status, redo, prolonged pump times and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e>, were predictors influencing in-hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>Coagulopathy</z:hpo>, low cardiac output, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, surgical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> leading to reoperation, were significantly related to in-hospital mortality (by correlation analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis showed that, emergency status (p=0.027), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (p=0.029), perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (p=0.0021), reoperation for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (p=0.0023), and pump time &gt;180 min (p=0.011), were significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival rate at 10 years follow-up was 84.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were 8 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier showed significant differences when considering dissection vs non-dissection (p=0.018), but did not reach significance in Marfan vs non-Marfan groups (p=0.83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>NYHA class IV (p=0.052), previous cardiac surgery procedure (p=0.041), concomitant CABG (p=0.021), total aortic arch reconstruction (p=0.001), and mitral valve replacement (p=0.016), were identified as significant by Log Rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Bentall procedure for aortic root replacement is safe and durable; in hospital mortality in elective status it was 1.28%; early and long-term mortality higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Six late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were procedures related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six patients (76.4%) were in NYHA I class at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The incidence of late outcomes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (1.03%), graft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (2.06%), pseudoaneurysm (0%), reoperation in ascending aorta or aortic valve (3.1%), operations on the remaining aorta (6.7%), and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> due to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy (1.03%), are very low </plain></SENT>
