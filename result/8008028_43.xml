<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The fibrillin gene encodes a protein in the extracellular matrix, and this protein is widely distributed in elastic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The fibrillin gene is the site of mutations causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This disorder shows a high degree of clinical variability both between and within families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each family appears to have a unique mutation in the fibrillin gene, which precludes the routine use of mutation screening for presymptomatic diagnosis of the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to develop a widely applicable method of molecular diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used three newly characterized intragenic sites of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> DNA repeat-sequence variation (i.e., polymorphisms) as markers to follow the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> pattern of specific copies (alleles) of the fibrillin gene in multiple kindreds with various clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The polymorphic markers allowed identification of the particular copy of the fibrillin gene that cosegregated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> in 13 of the 14 families tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 11 families a definite presymptomatic diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> could be made in family members who had only equivocal manifestations of the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In two other families, some family members demonstrated either classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> or a milder but closely related phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The copy of the fibrillin gene that cosegregated with classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> was not inherited by family members with the latter, atypical, form of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These milder phenotypes, previously diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, were not associated with aortic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results document the usefulness of novel polymorphic DNA repeat sequences in the presymptomatic diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings also demonstrate that the various clinical phenotypes seen in selected families may be due not to single fibrillin mutations, but rather to different genetic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings underscore the need for a modification of the current diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> in order to achieve accurate risk assessment </plain></SENT>
