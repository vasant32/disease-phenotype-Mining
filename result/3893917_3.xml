<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients with the skeletal stigmata of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> or the physical and radiographic findings of Marfan's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> (or both) were studied using intravenous digital subtraction aortography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction aortography revealed a <z:mp ids='MP_0011575'>dilated aortic root</z:mp> in 16 of the 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of the 17 had mildly dilated aortic sinuses with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the four children (less than or equal to 16 years of age) had aortic diameters which were greater than the 95th percentile for their body surface area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average aortic root diameter in the adult patients was 6.8 cm (range, 4-11 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of the 17 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, two of which were detected by digital subtraction aortography and two by aortic root injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four of 13 adults and three children had pulmonary arterial diameters which exceeded 4 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six patients underwent ascending aorta and valvular replacement and were studied with digital subtraction aortography after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> preoperative and postoperative studies were of adequate diagnostic quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aortic root diameters calculated from intravenous digital subtraction angiograms correlated well with those derived from echocardiography (r2 = 0.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that intravenous digital subtraction aortography is effective in diagnosing and following Marfan's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> both before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
