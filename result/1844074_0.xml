<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By the survey of pedigrees and examination of these patients, including ocular, systemic, skeletal X-ray, psychocardiogram, and urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium-nitroprusside</z:chebi> test, 21 cases were diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, 6 cases as simple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo>, 3 cases as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265313" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Weill-Marchesani</z:e>'s syndrome, 4 cases as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000526'>aniridia</z:hpo> and 1 case as homecys tinuria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that the most significant ocular manifestation of congenital lenticular dislocation was reduction in visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The severity of visual disturbance varied with the types of dislocation and the visual deficiency was closely related to the intermediate-grade (II) dislocation of the lens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Examination of ERG showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> function in most of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From this, we believe that the major cause of visual reduction in congenital lenticular dislocation is lenticular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000483'>astigmatism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There fore, early diagnosis and effective correction of vision should be emphasized to prevent the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000646'>amblyopia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
