<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate transarterial catheter embolization (TAE) for the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005261'>hemarthrosis</z:hpo> of the knee in 35 patients treated at two different hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From June 1998 through January 2011, 35 patients (22 men and 13 women, mean age 57 years) underwent TAE for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005261'>hemarthrosis</z:hpo> of the knee using polyvinyl alcohol particles (<z:chebi fb="10" ids="53706">PVA</z:chebi> particles), multi-curled 0.018in. microcoils or a combination of both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In one patient a detachable microcoil was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005261'>Hemarthrosis</z:hpo> developed after arthroscopy in 9, after trauma in 3, after arthroplasty in 18 and after <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2 patients had severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gonarthrosis</z:e> and in one patient <z:hpo ids='HP_0005261'>hemarthrosis</z:hpo> was due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiographies showed abnormal and <z:mp ids='MP_0001616'>increased vasculature</z:mp> in 23 patients, one or more pseudoaneurysms in 8 and arterio-venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient showed both, pseudoaneurysm and hypervascularization and another one pseudoaneurysm and arterio-venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the patients developed procedure-related complications such as periarticular skin- or tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, including a patient who underwent TAE of two different <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> sources in two consecutive sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical success was 93.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients showed recurrent swelling of the knee, 377 and 824 days after TAE respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, only one of them required secondary TAE because of abnormal and <z:mp ids='MP_0001616'>increased vasculature</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our view, TAE is the treatment of choice for the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005261'>hemarthrosis</z:hpo> of the knee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is an effective and minimally invasive technique with very low complication rates </plain></SENT>
