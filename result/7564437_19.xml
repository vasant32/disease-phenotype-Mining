<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with 13 thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>, single or multiple, or grafts (4) participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The causes of disease were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (4), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (2), trauma (1), and unknown (1), and there were two dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spin-echo imaging and cine velocity mapping in 10 mm thick slices with vertical and horizontal velocity encoding were done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Maps of the two velocity components were processed into multiple computer-generated streaks whose orientation and length corresponded to velocity vectors in the chosen plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dynamic arrow maps were compared with previously reported aortic arrow maps from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The forward flow occupied the entire lumen in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aorta in systole and small vortices were only present in the sinuses of Valsalva </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in the ascending aorta were located at the anterior right and had oblique, eccentric jet flows that created a large secondary vortex in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> had a central jet and two large vortices, one on each side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, dissections, and grafts had irregular flows and vortices not seen in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging with multidirectional velocity mapping is a powerful noninvasive tool to assess morphologic features and disturbed blood flow in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recognizably altered flow patterns were found to be associated with altered vessel geometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The significance of this requires further investigation </plain></SENT>
