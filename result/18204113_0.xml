<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MS is characterized by a high degree of penetration and expression of the pathological gene </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this paper is to evaluate the frequency of occurrence of factors influencing abnormalities in respiratory tract functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study encompassed 45 patients with MS syndrome ranging in age from 2 to 54 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both clinical examination and morphological measurements were performed in each case </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on the measurements recorded, the following indexes were evaluated: width/length index of the head, morphological index of the face, and index of chest flattening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of chest deformities was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
