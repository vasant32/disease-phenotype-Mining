<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Serial echocardiographic measurements of aortic root dimensions are an important clinical method for monitoring patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there are few data on the prognostic importance of echocardiographic variables for risk stratification and timing of aortic root replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 89 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (age range 1-54 years) clinical and serial echocardiographic data (n = 62) were evaluated as potential predictors of outcome (mean (range) follow up 4 (&lt; 1-16) years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aortic sinus diameter and an aortic ratio normalised for age and body surface area were examined using Kaplan-Meier life table and Cox regression analysis, with the end point defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004933'>ascending aortic dissection</z:hpo> and events defined as an end point or surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall actuarial survival at two and five years was 96% and 92% and event free survival was 85% and 76%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were five <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, four patients survived surgery for ascending dissection, and nine underwent root replacement with a composite graft for ascending <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those with aortic events were older (35 (12) v 25 (13) years, P = 0.007) and had greater initial aortic root dimensions (47 (14) v 33 (8) mm, P &lt; 0.0001) and ratios (1.6 (0.5) v 1.3 (0.2), P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 62 patients with serial echocardiographic follow up, the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> was more rapid in those with events (15 (17) v 0 (3)%/year, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Utilising a Cox proportional hazards model, the groups with an initial aortic ratio &gt; or = 1.3 or an annual change in aortic ratio &gt; or = 5% had a relative risk of an aortic complication of 2.7 and 4.1, respectively (95% confidence limits 1.5 to 4.8 and 1.8 to 9.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only one of 31 patients with an initial aortic ratio of &lt; 1.3 and a rate of change of &lt; 5% had an event (five year event free survival 97%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A low risk subgroup of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> can be identified as those with an aortic ratio &lt; 1.3 and an annual change in aortic ratio of &lt; 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings are helpful in optimising echocardiographic monitoring and risk stratification of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
