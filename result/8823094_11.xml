<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Composite aortic root replacement is accepted treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta involving the root with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo>, but controversy continues regarding the best technique of operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We excise the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, implant a composite valve graft, directly attach the coronary arteries to the aortic graft, and make the distal anastomosis to the divided aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the records and collected complete follow-up data on 110 consecutive patients having composite aortic root replacement with this technique from 1979 to 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Average age was 54 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> was present in 22 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissections in 26, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissections in 11, and active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> in 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Operative characteristics were: 25 emergency procedures, 33 urgent procedures, 52 elective procedures, 24 reoperations, and 19 with coronary artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in 8 patients (7.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate predictors of hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival was 70% at 10 years (standard error, 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate predictors of total mortality were porcine valve, Bj√∂rk-Shiley valve, preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, reoperation on a composite valve graft, and coronary artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only 3 patients required late reoperation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> for valve dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Actuarial freedom from reoperation on the aortic root was 97.3% (standard error, 1.9%) at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Late echocardiograms in 47 patients showed no anastomotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Composite aortic root replacement with direct coronary implantation is effective and durable treatment for a variety of aortic pathologic conditions in elective and emergency situations </plain></SENT>
