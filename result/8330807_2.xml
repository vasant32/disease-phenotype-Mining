<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> was considered to be due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischaemia</z:e> from dissection involving the left coronary artery </plain></SENT>
