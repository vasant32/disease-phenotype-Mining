<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe two cases who presented acutely with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> and were later found to have changes of undiagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0005200'>retroperitoneal fibrosis</z:hpo> causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000126'>hydronephrosis</z:hpo> on computed tomography (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An association is readily understandable based on the current hypotheses for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and the etiology of RPF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We suggest why this has not been noted previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CT has an established role in the diagnosis and follow up of RPF as well as in the assessment of the aortic complications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Awareness of the possibility of RPF and it's demonstration on CT may allow early diagnosis and help prevent significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> </plain></SENT>
