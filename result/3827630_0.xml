<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Disorders of this system lead to the development of certain diseases, transformation of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cell into a malignant one, <z:mp ids='MP_0003786'>premature aging</z:mp> of a cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The activity of reparative systems is related with an enzyme complex controlled by the corresponding genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary diseases</z:e> is described in which disturbances in the DNA reparative processes induced by physical or chemical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25435">mutagenes</z:chebi> are found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some diseases are also characterized by genome instability due to which there is a spontaneous increase in chromosome aberrations or sister chromatid exchanges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The impairment of the reparative DNA processes was first found in the author's laboratory in a number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary diseases</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo>) and diseases with hereditary prerisposition (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that disorders of reparative DNA systems form the basis for molecular and genetic mechanisms of pathogenesis both in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary diseases</z:e>, and the diseases with hereditary predisposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of the molecular level of cell organization in the pathologic state will ensure new methods of diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
