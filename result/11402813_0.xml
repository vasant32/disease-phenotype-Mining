<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were 73 males and 39 females of mean age 59.2 years (range 19-79); in the majority they presented a history of essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and atherosclerotic disease: the first diagnostic suspicion has been confirmed either by angio-CT scan or by CT scan plus aorthography and, from 1994, with transesophageal color doppler echocardiography that is becoming a valuable and precise tool wich can be used in emergency room </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bentall type composite repair or modified Bentall technique has been possible in 37 patients, while in the remaning 75, surgical aortic repair has been achieved by interposition of a dacron vascular prosthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac procedures that were performed in addition were coronary bypass grafthing, resuspension of the aortic valve, AVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total arch replacement with reimplantation of brachiocephalic vessels were performed in 6 patients and partial in 10, when intimal tear extended into the arc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirthythree in hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (29.4%) occurred (15 in S.O. and 18 in UCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow up of the hospital survivors was conducted at a mean postoperative interval of 55 months (range 2 to 149 months with 6 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our experience shows an increased incidence <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">marfan's syndrome</z:e> as a source of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in the late years, transesophageal echocardiography is a excellent tool for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> but it may miss dissection localized in other aortic portion, the need of an individualized and conservative surgical approach tailored to the pathology encountered </plain></SENT>
