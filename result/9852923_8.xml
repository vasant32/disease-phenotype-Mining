<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: To test the hypothesis that changes in the activity of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) are responsible for the damage to connective tissue in these lesions, histochemical studies of the immunoreactivity (IR) for MMPs and their tissue TIMPs (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2) were made in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAAs</z:chebi> (n = 7) and aortic valves (n = 5) from 7 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAAs</z:chebi> showed cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMN</z:e>), with loss of elastic fibers and smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extensive areas of myxoid change were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aortic valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Areas of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMN</z:e> showed no IR for any MMPs or TIMPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IR of smooth muscle cells at the borders of areas of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMN</z:e> was stronger for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> MMPs, especially MMP-2 and MMP-9, than in other regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The surfaces of disrupted elastic fibers showed IR for MMP-2 and MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Areas of myxoid change showed similar but less pronounced alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that the defect in fibrillin-1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> leads to (1) formation of elastin that is abnormally aggregated and more easily degraded by MMPs than is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elastin, (2) upregulation of the synthesis of MMPs, (3) progressive destruction of connective tissue by these enzymes, and (4) development of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAAs</z:chebi> and valvular lesions </plain></SENT>
