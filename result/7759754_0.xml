<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: Thirty-five eyes of 18 patients (age 8 to 47, average 25.3) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight eyes were followed conservatively, the remaining 27 eyes underwent a lensectomy either with the Klöti vitreous stripper (18) or using other techniques (9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over follow-up periods ranging from 0.5 to 13 years (average 6.2 years) low visual acuity was found in non-operated eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>Retinal detachment</z:hpo> occurred in 2 out of 8 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eyes undergoing other surgical techniques had a mean final visual acuity of 0.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>Retinal detachment</z:hpo> occurred with high frequency (6 out of 9 eyes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lensectomy-vitrectomy was a safe and effective procedure with a mean final visual acuity of 0.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> or secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>COMMENT: Our study suggests that performing lensectomy-vitrectomy with the Klöti vitreous stripper is the best surgical approach in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This technique allows the vitreous to be handled more effectively and has led to improve results </plain></SENT>
