<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Molecular defects in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> fibrillin are believed to be responsible for impaired structural integrity of cardiovascular, skeletal, and ocular tissues in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Traditionally, excellent results have been achieved with the Bentall composite graft repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, because of the potential complications associated with prosthetic valves, there is growing interest in techniques that preserve the native aortic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between May 1994 and February 1995, 15 patients with a history of concomitant or remote aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> or dissection underwent operation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specimens of aortic valve, ascending aortic wall, and mitral valve were obtained specifically to observe differences in fibrillin content and architecture between patients with (n = 9) and without (n = 6) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, control specimens of aortic valve, aortic wall, and mitral valve were obtained from 4 patients with isolated valvular or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> but no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> or other aortic pathologic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin immunostaining using indirect immunofluorescence was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specimens were coded and graded by a blinded observer to determine quantity, homogeneity, and fragmentation of fibrillin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Observed fibrillin abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and control patients were limited to the midportion (elastin-associated microfibrils) of the aortic valve, aortic wall, and mitral valve tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin abnormalities of aortic valve, aortic wall, and mitral valve tissues were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and were most severe in those older than 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similar fibrillin abnormalities of aortic valve and aortic wall specimens were observed in control patients more than 60 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Even in the setting of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing aortic valve, the current rationale for widespread use of valve-sparing repairs of aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and patients older than 60 years should be carefully reexamined in light of these findings </plain></SENT>
