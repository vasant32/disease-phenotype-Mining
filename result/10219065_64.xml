<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Replacement of the aortic root with a prosthetic graft and valve in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> may prevent premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from rupture of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the results of this surgical procedure at 10 experienced surgical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 675 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> underwent replacement of the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival and morbidity-free survival curves were calculated, and risk factors were determined from a multivariable regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 30-day mortality rate was 1.5 percent among the 455 patients who underwent elective repair, 2.6 percent among the 117 patients who underwent urgent repair (within 7 days after a surgical consultation), and 11.7 percent among the 103 patients who underwent emergency repair (within 24 hours after a surgical consultation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 675 patients, 202 (30 percent) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> involving the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-six percent of the 158 adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and a documented aortic diameter had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with a diameter of 6.5 cm or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 114 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (more than 30 days after surgery); dissection or rupture of the residual aorta (22 patients) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (21 patients) were the principal causes of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was greatest within the first 60 days after surgery, then rapidly decreased to a constant level by the end of the first year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elective aortic-root replacement has a low operative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, emergency repair, usually for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, is associated with a much higher early mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because nearly half the adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> had an aortic-root diameter of 6.5 cm or less at the time of operation, it may be prudent to undertake prophylactic repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> when the diameter of the aorta is well below that size </plain></SENT>
