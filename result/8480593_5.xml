<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine the clinical spectrum of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta, we searched the University of California, San Francisco (USCF) Echocardiography Data Base for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta (&gt; or = 5.0 cm in diameter) seen over a 7-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The echocardiograms and clinical courses of these patients were then reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta: five had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> &gt; 7.0 cm in diameter, three had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> 6.0 to 6.9 cm, and seven had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> 5.0 to 5.9 cm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the five patients &lt; 50 years of age, four had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, and among the 10 patients &gt; or = 50 years of age, eight had evidence of atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At presentation, 13 patients had nonspecific symptoms, and two were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography demonstrated that 12 patients had at least mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> and that five had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of the seven patients who underwent surgical resection died of an intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, and two of the eight patients treated medically died within 1 week of presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the clinical spectrum of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta is wide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are often unsuspected, physicians should have a low threshold for imaging the ascending aorta in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> or atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, particularly when <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> is present </plain></SENT>
