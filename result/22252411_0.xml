<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>External ear, stapes, and vestibular aqueduct pathologies are reported as some of the otological deformities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the malleus and incus pathologies of the ear are not reported in any study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the morphometric measurements carried out, the distance between the malleus head and manubrium was found to be 9.8 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When similar measurements were carried out for the incus, the distance between the upper part of the incus body and tip of the long process was found to be 6.9 mm </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It can be concluded from this study that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, in addition to the musculoskeletal alterations particularly in bone synthesis, the ossicular chain in the middle ear is also affected </plain></SENT>
