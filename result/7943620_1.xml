<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine cases (59 SLE patients and 20 SSD patients) belonging to different ethnic groups were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 47 patients of Yakutian nationality, among them SLE 38 patients and SSD nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 32 patients (SLE-21, and SSD-11) migrant Europeans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It has been proved that the aboriginal people of the North are more subject to SLE and SSD diseases as compared to the migrants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It has also been proved that the greater spreading of the diseases, with the collagen metabolism disturbance in the first ethnic group, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> may be explained by genetic peculiarities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some ethnically stipulated differences in clinical manifestations of two large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235910" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">collagenosis</z:e> were revealed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, during SLE smaller frequency of the skin impairment in the Yakuts (due to natural <z:mp ids='MP_0001188'>hyperpigmentations</z:mp>) is connected with the considerable frequency of large joints impairment and more frequent course of SLE similar to rheumatoid variant with typical wrist deformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One-third SLE and SSD patients of Yakut nationality reveal "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410000" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">overlap-syndrome</z:e>", which are typical of other collagenoses, the so-called <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410000" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">overlap-syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some industrial factors (dust of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30563">silicon dioxide</z:chebi>, vibration, <z:chebi fb="59" ids="24632">hydrocarbon</z:chebi> compounds) are the main reason for the diseases among the newcomers migrants of Russian and Ukranian nationality </plain></SENT>
