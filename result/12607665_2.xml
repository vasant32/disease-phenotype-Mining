<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgical results have not improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The charts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 70 patients surgically treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> during the period of January 1988 through April 2001 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Average age was 59 +/- 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comorbidities included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (66%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (17%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At presentation, 23% were in shock, 17% had neurologic dysfunction, and 36% had coronary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aortic valve was preserved in 55 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Distal aortic anastomosis was performed under aortic cross-clamp ("closed") in 32 and "open" under <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> in 38 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality was 18.6% (13 of 70 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients in shock had an operative mortality of 50% compared with stable patients of 9% (p = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mortality was similar regardless of technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis revealed preoperative shock (p = 0.0002), tamponade (p = 0.003), and neurologic deficit (p = 0.02) to be associated with mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed hemodynamic stability (odds ratio = 0.10, p = 0.04) and outside transfer (odds ratio = 0.12, p = 0.03) to be negative predictors of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of 57 survivors, follow-up was 93% complete for an average of 46 +/- 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The overall late reoperation rate was 24.6% (14 of 57 patients) at 50.3 +/- 12.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients (21%) underwent future aortic aneurysmal repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No difference in reoperation rate was seen comparing "closed" (26%) with "open" (18%; p = 0.46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Of 42 preserved native valves, only 3 (7.1%) needed future valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, operative mortality was determined by preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemodynamic instability</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Technique did not impact survival or late reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis and repair is critical to improving survival </plain></SENT>
