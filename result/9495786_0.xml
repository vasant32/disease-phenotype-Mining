<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prominence of the left midcardiac border was seen in 11 patients: the upper midsegment in one, the lower midsegment in two, and the whole midsegment in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Either a linear or an arcuate contour was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The contours of the prominent left midcardiac border in three patients who had moderate to marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> and a cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) over 59% were nonspecific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the remaining eight patients (47%), the contour was considered to be characteristic of AAE, as suggested by the displacement of either <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> or part of the right ventricular outflow tract, main pulmonary artery and left atrial appendage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients showed only left midcardiac border prominence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The contour of the left midcardiac border on the conventional frontal chest radiograph is characteristic and of paramount importance for the diagnosis of AAE in Marfan' s syndrome or its forme fruste, particularly in patients whose CTRs are within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
