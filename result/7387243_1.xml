<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The valve lesions resulted from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> in 20 patients, 15 of whom had had a previous operation including 13 aortic valve procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> necessitated AVR in 5 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had physical findings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rhd">rheumatic heart disease</z:e> and required double-valve (aortic and mitral) replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six different types of prosthesis were used: the Smeloff-Cutter, Starr-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e>, Cooley-Cutter, Hancock porcine, Ionescu-Shiley, and Bjork-Shiley </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first patient in the series was the only early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (3.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Log-term follow-up data ranging from 1 month to 10 years were available on 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred (11.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> survivors are doing well and have good exercise tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that AVR performed in childhood is a safe, durable, and well-tolerated form of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Later replacement, if necessary, can be accomplished with larger-sized prostheses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our present choice is the Ionescu-Shiley bovine xenograft because of its superior hemodynamic characteristics and low incidence of embolic complications </plain></SENT>
