<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the first child (R., aged 6 years and 8 months) following four episodes of intense pain in the left orbit, lasting between 10 and 30 min and accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000613'>photophobia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These episodes, which lasted between 20 and 30 min, took place mainly at night and were accompanied by phono-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000613'>photophobia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both cases, the pain attacks can be interpreted as a result of compression of the root of the trigeminal nerve caused by an arterial malformation </plain></SENT>
