<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 56-year-old man with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> was scheduled for a valve-sparing aortic root replacement operation because of annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When the operation started, SpO2 decreased at the time of the median sternotomy, and increased by manual inflation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After sternal closure, PIP increased from 20 cmH2O to 28 cmH2O, SpO2 decreased from 98% to 66%, and the expiratory pattern indicated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">airway obstruction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because hypoxemia persisted, we reopened the sternum, resulting in increased SpO2 and decreased PIP, but hypercapnea remained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed a narrowing of the tracheal and bronchial lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002786'>tracheobronchomalacia</z:hpo>, and the tracheal tube was advanced to just above the carina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We succeeded in extubating 7 days after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since he had severe persisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo>, we suggested reopening the partial sternum to decompress the intrathoracic pressure, and closing the skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sternum was reopened, and he had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> after the second operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002786'>tracheobronchomalacia</z:hpo> is considered to be related to the connective tissue defect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Suddenly SpO2 is decreased and PIP and Et(<z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>) are increased after closure of the sternum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Bronchoscopy was useful in making the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
