<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ages of the patients were in the range 5-73 years (mean 29.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 63 males and 34 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> with root abscesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-one had congenitally small aortic roots and 20 patients had such severe root calcification that root replacement was required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient had an aortic sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> repaired using this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality (overall 24%) analysed by operative indication was highest for prosthetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>20% of those with root calcification and 15% of those operated on for hypoplastic roots died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>Endocarditis</z:hpo> was cured in 19 of 20 survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient needed repeat root replacement to achieve this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients out of 35 survivors in the hypoplastic group were restudied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean subvalvular gradient was 12 +/- 9 mmHg (range 0-27 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Late mortality was lowest in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> group (5%), and 11% in the hypoplastic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were 4 (24%) late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the root calcification group but 2 were non cardiac </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Eight homograft roots failed, two in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> group and one in the hypoplastic group due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The remainder failed because of 'wear and tear' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Five were replaced using homografts and one by a composite graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Two were treated by prosthetic subcoronary aortic valve replacement with pericardial patch enlargement of the root </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This was replaced by a homograft root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>There are 5 long term survivors of 7 repeat aortic root replacements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
