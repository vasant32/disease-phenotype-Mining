<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results of algorithmic mechanisms of detection, which provide a diagnosis during establishment of phenotypically homogeneous subgroups of patients within existing nosologic entities, are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With such an approach, efficiency of diagnosis reaches 90% and more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In case of various possible modes of inheriting a disease with a genealogic history fragmentary or absent the authors propose that determining a possible type of hereditary transmission should be approached by analysis of phenotypical similarity of difference with reference to patients with cleared dominant or recessive type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latter is based on the discovery of phenotypical difference between patients with differing types of transmission of the mutant genes </plain></SENT>
