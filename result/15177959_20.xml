<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective noncomparative case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 116 eyes of 58 patients with PMCD seen between 1990 and 2002 at the Cornea Service at L.V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad, India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of PMCD was based on the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005543'>corneal thinning</z:mp> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cornea above or below the area of thinning with no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo>, vascularization, or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_42'>lipid deposition</z:mpath> and typical topographic features whenever topography was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A detailed history including the age of presentation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic diseases</z:e>, atopy, and relevant family history was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The visual acuity (VA) at presentation; the location, extent, and degree of thinning; presence of concurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>keratoconus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001119'>keratoglobus</z:hpo>; and complications, if any, were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mode of visual rehabilitation; surgical procedure, if any; and the final VA achieved were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical features, associations, complications, and outcome of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 45 males (77.6%) and 13 females (22.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were bilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp>, no clinical features of PMCD were seen, but the diagnosis was made based on topographic features of typical PMCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The age of the patients ranged from 8 to 66 years, with a mean of 34.0+/-14.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One patient (1.7%) had associated vernal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001096'>keratoconjunctivitis</z:hpo> (VKC), 1 (1.7%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, and 1 (1.7%) had ocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000483'>astigmatism</z:hpo> was &lt;5.0 diopters (D) in 19 eyes (19.2%), 5 to 10 D in 36 (36.4%), 10 to 15 D in 23 (23.2%), 15 to 20 D in 15 (15.2%), and &gt;20 D in 6 (6.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Typical inferior PMCD was seen in 99 eyes (85.3%), and superior PMCD was seen in 17 (14.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The thinning was commonly seen between the 5-o'clock and 7-o'clock positions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In 12 eyes (10.3%), PMCD was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>keratoconus</z:hpo>, and in 15 eyes (12.9%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001119'>keratoglobus</z:hpo> was associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Seven eyes (6.0%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>hydrops</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity improved in 52 eyes (55.3%) with correction, in 40 eyes (42.6%) it remained the same as that of the initial presentation, and in 2 eyes (2.1%) it worsened relative to the initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Forty-<z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eyes</z:mp> (35.3%) received spectacles, and 31 eyes (26.7%) were fitted with rigid gas-permeable contact lenses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Five eyes (4.3%) underwent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Lamellar keratoplasty was performed in 3 eyes, and a crescentic lamellar graft was done in 2 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity improved in 4 eyes after surgery with a follow-up of 2 to 37 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The final <z:hpo ids='HP_0000483'>astigmatism</z:hpo> in the operated eyes at the last follow-up ranged from 4 to 11 D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pellucid marginal <z:hpo ids='HP_0007705'>corneal degeneration</z:hpo> was seen predominantly in males in this series, and was not strongly associated with VKC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>Keratoconus</z:hpo> was seen in approximately 10% of the eyes, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001119'>keratoglobus</z:hpo> in approximately 13% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Superior PMCD was seen in approximately 15% of the eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In our study, patients presented with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000483'>astigmatism</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>hydrops</z:hpo> was a common complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients were treated with spectacles or contact lens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Surgery for PMCD-lamellar keratoplasty and crescentic lamellar keratoplasty, if indicated-usually results in significant residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0000483'>astigmatism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
