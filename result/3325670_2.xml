<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The original operation is described with reference to modifications suggested by a number of authors throughout the last 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods of achieving coronary artery continuity by Carrel patch and pull-through by saphenous vein interposition and by synthetic graft techniques are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While any of these methods may be needed in individual cases the preference of the author remains for simplicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The arguments for and against excision of the aneurysmal sac are considered in relation to the control of haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The early and medium term results of operation are good but in comparing results world-wide a lack of uniform diagnostic criteria is apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The full clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> presents little difficulty but the status of "annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath>", Erdheim's medionecrosis, "cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>" and many other pathological descriptions are not defined: "forme fruste" of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's disease</z:e> has been used for any of the above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interpretation of surgical results remains difficult and often impossible in the absence of clear definitions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recent work on elastic tissue and on the chemistry of collagen together with the hope of identification of the genetic background now offers real hope of clearer understanding </plain></SENT>
