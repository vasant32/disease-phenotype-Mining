<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Reimplantation valve-sparing aortic root replacement has been increasingly performed with improving perioperative and mid-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The success of this operation primarily depends on preserving the highly sophisticated dynamic function of the aortic valve by recreating an anatomical three-dimensional configuration similar to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortic root, thus minimizing the mechanical stress and strain on the cusps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over the years several techniques have been proposed to reproduce the sinuses of Valsalva </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed our experience with aortic valve reimplantation by means of a modified Dacron graft that incorporates sinuses of Valsalva, in a series of 100 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During a 60-month period, 100 patients with aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> underwent aortic valve reimplantation using the Gelweave Valsalva prosthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 74 males and the mean age was 60+/-12 years (range 28-83 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients had the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, 15 had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cusp repair was performed in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up time was 28.6 months (range 1-60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiogram was performed at the end of each procedure to assess the aortic valve in terms of competence, dynamic motion and level of coaptation within the graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was one hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and two late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall survival at 60 months was 91.7+/-5.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Five patients developed severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003504" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ai">aortic incompetence</z:e> (AI) during follow-up requiring aortic valve replacement (AVR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The 60 months freedom from re-operation due to AI was 90.9+/-4.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One patient had moderate AI at latest echocardiographic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The 60 months freedom from AI&gt;2+ was 91.6+/-7.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Cox regression identified cusp's repair as independent risk factor (P=0.001) for late reimplantation failure (AVR or AI&gt;2+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>There were no episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> and the majority of the patients (88%) were in New York Heart Association functional class I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The aortic valve reimplantation with the Gelweave Valsalva prosthesis provided satisfactory mid-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>An accurate assessment of the level of coaptation of the aortic cusps in respect to the lower rim of the Dacron graft by means of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram at the end of each procedure is mandatory in order to avoid early reimplantation failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Cusp's repair may play an important role in the development of late AI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, long-term results are needed in order to define the durability of this technique </plain></SENT>
