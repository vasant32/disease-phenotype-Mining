<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients underwent helical CT of the thorax because of suspected thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and 17 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two reviewers, unaware of the final diagnosis, evaluated the images by consensus for laminar thickness, foraminal width, dural sac ratios, and vertebral scalloping for T2-T12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At T9-T12, dural sac ratios at the midcorpus level (p = 0.031) and foraminal width (p = 0.0124) were significantly greater in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> than in the patients without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dural sac ratios at lower endplate levels (p = 0.0685), laminar thickness (p = 0.951), and vertebral scalloping (p = 0.24) were not significantly greater in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> than in the patients without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Because the phenotypic expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> is variable, information on the spine from thoracic studies in combination with major criteria may be helpful clinically </plain></SENT>
