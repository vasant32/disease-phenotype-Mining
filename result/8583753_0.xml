<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On examination, subluxation of the lens and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100018'>nuclear cataract</z:hpo> were seen on both eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diurnal pressure curve showed great fluctuations in pressure with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> IOP in the morning and elevated pressure in the evening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pressure measurement revealed great fluctuations depending on positioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because of cataractous lens in the right eye blocking the visual axis and uncontrollable, phacogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> removal of the lens by cryoextraction was necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity increased to 0.5 and IOP was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> after three weeks </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Measurement of IOP at different positions seems to be an effective provocation test in cases of phacogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In suspected cases, measurement of IOP at different positions that may provoce IOP-increase could be useful in the early detection of lens-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
