<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Criteria for the diagnosis can be established similar to those applicable to mitral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 500 consecutive patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, there were no cases of isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001704'>tricuspid valve prolapse</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 53 (21%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> also had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001704'>tricuspid valve prolapse</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four of six (67%) patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> also had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001704'>tricuspid valve prolapse</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of this echocardiographic pattern as an isolated finding as well as associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> was significantly less than previous angiographic reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with both these findings tended to be older than those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> alone, but clinically differed in no other way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Use of standardized technique can minimize errors in diagnosis </plain></SENT>
