<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> attributable to coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dissection was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> in the first case, and occurred three weeks postpartum in the second case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In case 1, dissection occurred within the intima, and was not associated with an inflammatory cell infiltrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cases 2 and 3, dissection occurred between the tunica media and the external elastic lamina, and was associated with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate, rich in eosinophils, T lymphocytes, and histiocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The spatial limitation of the inflammatory infiltrate to the adventitial compartment, together with the absence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in case 1, suggests a reactive origin rather than a causative role for the inflammatory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Detailed examination of serial blocks of any coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is essential in young patients </plain></SENT>
