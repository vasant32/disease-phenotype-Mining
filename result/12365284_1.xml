<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: At first glance the aortic valve is a relative simple valve mechanism connecting the left ventricle and the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detailed analysis of the different components of the aortic valve including the leaflets and sinuses revealed a complex motion of each part leading to a perfect durable valve mechanism at rest and during exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Theoretically, the reconstruction or imitation of these structures in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e> should lead to optimal results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prerequisite is the exact knowledge of the important functional characteristics of the aortic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dynamic behavior of the aortic root closely harmonizing with the leaflets not only warrants stress minimizing and valve durability, but also optimizes coronary flow, left ventricular function and aortic impedance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The newly discovered contractile capacity of the leaflets and the root components are important for tuning the dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AORTIC VALVE RECONSTRUCTION: Isolated reconstruction of the aortic valve such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_48'>decalcification</z:mpath>, commissurotomy, plication of ring or leaflets of a tricuspid aortic valve and cusp extension are seldom indicated in contrast to the reconstruction of the bicuspid insufficient valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Proper indication and skilled techniques lead to excellent hemodynamic and clinical intermediate-term result up to 7 years after reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Latest follow-up revealed a mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> of 0.7, maximal pressure gradient of 11.4 +/- 8.5 mm Hg with zero hospital or late mortality, reoperation or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> in 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reconstructive techniques for aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and/or type A dissection according to David or Yacoub have become routine procedures in the last 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The hemodynamic and clinical results are excellent with low reoperation rate and very low risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Generally, a maximal diameter of the root of 5 cm is indicative for performing the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> the reconstruction should be advanced even with smaller diameters especially if these are progressive and combined with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ROSS-OPERATION: The Ross-Operation includes the replacement of the diseased aortic valve with the pulmonary autograft and reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract using a homograft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The hemodynamic results are excellent regarding the autograft and also the clinical results with very low thromboembolic risk and acceptable reoperation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This method is especially indicated for active young patients, women, who desire children, athletes and patients in general, who like to avoid long-term anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In some cases the homograft may develop a dysfunction predominantly a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001642'>pulmonary stenosis</z:hpo> requiring reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In the author's series of 245 Ross-operations in 12 years the homograft had to be replaced in 4 cases without letality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Innovative, decellularized homografts with the potential to repopulate with autologeous cells show promising results after 1 year of clinical implantation without signs of antibody development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Probably these tissue-engineered modification may improve the homograft results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The reconstructive techniques of the aortic valve and the Ross-operation have a certain risk of reoperation that must be weighed against the advantages of very low hospital and late valve related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, excellent hemodynamics, very low risk of macro- and microembolism as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, lack of long-term anticoagulation and unrestricted life-style </plain></SENT>
