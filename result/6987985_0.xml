<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously regarded as extracardiac and benign, it is now clear that these auscultatory findings are central to a disorder characterized by abnormal systolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath>) of the mitral leaflets into the left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although it may be the result of diverse etiologies, the usual case represents an idiopathic, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary disorder</z:e> of the valve leaflets with pathologic findings similar to those in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The condition is very common and generally benign, and asymptomatic; however, a wide variety of clinical manifestations has been described, with a clinical picture at times indistinguishable from that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The small subset of patients at risk for malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> has yet to be fully characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although noninvasive techniques generally suffice for the diagnosis of MVP, left ventricular cineangiography is the definitive procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It remains for future studies in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients to define the relation between severity of MVP, its clinical manifestations, and its prognosis </plain></SENT>
