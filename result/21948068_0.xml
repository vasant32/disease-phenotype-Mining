<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Decrease in heart rate and blood pressure are frequently seen beneficial effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are several other hemodynamic effects of thoracic epidural anesthesia such as decrease in systemic vascular resistance, cardiac index, left ventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> work index among others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of thoracic epidural anesthesia on pulmonary artery pressure (<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>) has not been studied extensively in humans </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The possible mechanisms of decrease in pulmonary artery pressure in the described case are, decrease in the venous return to the heart, decrease in the systemic vascular resistance, decrease in the right ventric-ular function and finally, improvement in myocardial contraction secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The possibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> contributing to the decrease in <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> appears remote </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The authors present this case to generate discussion about the possible mechanisms involved in thoracic epidural anesthesia producing beneficial effects in patients with secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thoracic epidural anesthesia appears to decrease pulmonary artery pressure by a combination of several mechanisms, some unknown to us </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This occurrence, if studied and understood well could be put to clinical use in pulmonary hypertensives </plain></SENT>
