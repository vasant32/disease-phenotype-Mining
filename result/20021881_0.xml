<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze protein models of the mutation of the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene on Arg545Cys and Arg1530Cys which have been reported to cause predominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> in Chinese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We constructed and analyzed the protein models of the mutant FBN1 gene on Arg545Cys and Arg1530Cys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin-1 protein structures were predicted by SWISS-MODEL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Models were viewed in Swiss-Pdb Viewer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Computer construction and analysis of protein models of the mutant FBN1 gene revealed that the mutant Arg545Cys FBN1 protein had various changes on protein's secondary structure with an absence of a helix, decreased hydrogen bond distance, different protein surface solvent-accessibility and decreased negative electrostatic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mutant Arg1530Cys FBN1 showed lost of hydrogen bonds, different protein surface solvent-accessibility and increased negative electrostatic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Protein models of the mutant FBN1 gene shows significant alterations on the protein's secondary structure based on computer construction and analysis technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study provides further evidence for the important effect of the mutant FBN1 on the pathogenesis of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
