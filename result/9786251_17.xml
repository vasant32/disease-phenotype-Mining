<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Although some authors advocate hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> for spinal cord protection in descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal repair, this method has been associated with high morbidity and mortality rates in other studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The safety and effectiveness of this surgical adjunct were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between February 1991 and April 1997, 409 patients underwent thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of an inability to gain proximal aortic control because of anatomic or technical difficulty, hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> was used in 21 patients (4.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients were men, 8 were women, and the median age was 57 (range, 21 to 81 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients (19%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, and 1 had <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (33%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type A, 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type B, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> B), and 1 had aortic laceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but 6 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (73%) were operated on for repair of the distal arch and descending thoracic aorta, 4 (19%) for repair of the distal arch and thoracoabdominal aorta, and 2 for repair of either the thoracoabdominal or descending thoracic aorta alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surgery for 9 patients (43%) also included bypass grafts to the subclavian or innominate arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six operations (29%) were urgent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall 30-day mortality rate was 29% (6 of 21 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among urgent patients, the mortality rate was 50% (3 of 6 patients) versus 20% (3 of 15) for elective patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 15 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> occurred in 1 (7%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in 2 (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (67%) had pulmonary complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>Encephalopathy</z:hpo> occurred in 5 patients (33%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 2 (13%), and spinal cord neurologic deficit developed in 2 (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The median recovery was 28 days (range, 10 to 157 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> did not reduce the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and morbidity to a rate comparable with our conventional methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We recommend the judicious application of this method in rare instances when proximal control is not feasible or catastrophic intraoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> leave the surgeon with no other option </plain></SENT>
