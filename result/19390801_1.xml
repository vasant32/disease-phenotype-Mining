<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Para esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> is a rare childhood condition and reported series have had scant number of children which makes diagnosis a challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors sought to study the presentation and the outcome of treatment of congenital para esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo> (CPEH) over a period of 10 years from a single tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The records of 9 patients presenting between 1997 and 2007, were retrospectively analyzed for demographics, presenting features, referral diagnoses, investigations, management including operative procedures, their outcome and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine patients (3 males and 6 females) aged between 8 days to 34 months were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>Respiratory distress</z:hpo> (n=6), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (n=5) and frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011947'>respiratory tract infections</z:hpo> (n=3) were the most common presentations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000961'>Cyanosis</z:hpo> (n=2), cough and excessive crying were the other important symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The referral diagnoses in these patients included congenital Bochdalek's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo>, lung <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100730'>bronchogenic cyst</z:hpo>, pneumatocoele, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011950'>bronchiolitis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonias</z:hpo> which reflected a misinterpretation of their clinical findings and chest X-rays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven of these patients had other associated congenital anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001626'>cardiovascular abnormalities</z:hpo> and 2 had lesions of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A pair of siblings had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had abnormal chest C-rays and an UGS (upper GI series) proved to be diagnostic in 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The CT scans done in 4 patients corroborated the findings of the UGS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A laparotomy was done on most patients (n=8) which comprised of reduction of the stomach, resection of the hernial sac, tightening of the hiatus and a gastropexy or a gastrostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One patient, who underwent thoracotomy died of surgical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Two others died of causes unrelated to the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The remaining six operated patients have been followed up for a median of 3.5 years and are doing well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CPEH is uncommon in children, presented with respiratory tract symptoms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, and may be associated with Martan's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It should be considered in the workup of a child with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> or frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149725" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="LRTI">chest infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Abnormal chest X-rays may indicate the diagnosis and a subsequent UGS, is confirmatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The present study found the aparotomya good approach for repair of the wide hiatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>A gastropexy and a floppy fundoplication were added to prevent reherniation and post operative reflux though given the small numbers it is not possible to determine the place of either of these procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CPEH may be frequently associated with other congenital problems which may impact survival </plain></SENT>
