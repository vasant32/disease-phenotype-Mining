<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 52 year-old man underwent aortic valve replacement and ascending aortic replacement (Wheat procedure) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection (Stanford type A) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (grade 3/4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At that time, the aortic root was slightly dilated at about 45 mm and the descending aorta was within a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range at about 35 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty months after the initial operation, a follow-up chest enhanced computed tomography showed an aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> about 60 mm in diameter, a thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> about 70 mm in diameter and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First we performed the Bentall procedure, innominate artery and left common carotid artery replacement by 12 mm, and 10 mm Hemashield grafts during selective cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 10 weeks, we carried out aortic arch, descending aorta and left subclavian artery replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was uneventful and postoperative examination demonstrated a good surgical result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histological findings of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> wall showed cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> was excluded clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We could diagnose aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> by regular follow-up chest enhanced computed tomography (CT) and echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, cases with slight dilation of the aortic root in the Wheat procedure should undergo regular follow-up evaluation by chest enhanced CT and echocardiography </plain></SENT>
