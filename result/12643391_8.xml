<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study assesses the durability and clinical outcome of valve-sparing aortic root reconstruction using the reimplantation technique in a single center cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From July 1993 to July 2001, 158 patients underwent replacement of the ascending aorta with native valve reimplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean age of patients was 52 +/- 17 years (9 to 84 years), 103 were men (65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients (22%) suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic dissection</z:hpo> Stanford type A was present in 29 patients (19%) (22 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, 7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>), and concomitant partial or total arch replacement was necessary in 57 patients (36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One or more additional procedures were performed in 28 patients (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 36 +/- 25 months (0.4 to 96 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality was 3.8% (6 patients), but only 2.2% in elective patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean bypass time was 169 +/- 50 minutes (99 to 440 minutes), aortic cross-clamp time was 129 +/- 31 minutes (79 to 205 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients undergoing arch replacement, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> was 26 +/- 18 minutes (7 to 99 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, there were 5 (3.3%) cardiac-related late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> (AI) decreased from 2.3 +/- 1.1 (0 to 4) preoperatively to 0.23 +/- 0.44 (0 to 2) postoperatively (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Six patients required aortic valve replacement, 4 of those due to progressive AI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Average grade of AI increased significantly to 0.42 +/- 0.61 (0 to 3) at latest evaluation (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Two patients experienced a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> within the first postoperative week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No further thromboembolic complications were noticed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented with a favorable exercise tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The aortic valve reimplantation technique achieves excellent clinical outcome with few complications even in complex pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Lack of anticoagulation and favorable durability encourage wider and earlier use of this technique </plain></SENT>
