<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The causal factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> are not the same in the ascending and abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Atheroma is the dominant lesion in the abdominal aorta and genetic abnormalities predisposing to "mediacystic <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>" are more frequently observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The causal genetic abnormalities are multiple: abnormalities of fibrillin type I in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, collagen abnormalities in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e>, abnormalities of microfibrils, possible metallo-proteases, with many gene candidates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finally, some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valves</z:hpo>, some of which are familial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Familial factors are less evident in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>: genes favoring atheroma may be responsible but the factors which predispose to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and non stenosis are not well known: they would seem to be general factors because the tendency to arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> is diffuse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, because of the high risk of disease in a close relative, a familial enquiry would seem to be justified with echocardiography for close relatives of affected subjects, especially when young and female </plain></SENT>
