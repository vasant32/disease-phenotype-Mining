<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the peripheral organ arteries, the internal elastic lamella revealed a feature tentatively termed "osmiophilic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306863" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elastolysis</z:e>" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lytic changes appeared segmentally in the form of electron-dense fragments, and were partly absorbed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regenerated elastin had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> structure and surrounded the elastolytic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same changes were observed in the newly formed small areas of elastin in the thickened intima </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining elastic lamella in the affected region contained numerous fine electron-dense granules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intercellular substances, including collagen fibrils and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi>, other than elastic fibers, were increased secondarily in the elastolytic lesions without any evidence of ultrastructural abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Medical smooth muscle cells making contact with the elastolytic lesions were necrosed and absorbed, and smooth muscle cells in a state of synthesis were increased in the adjacent areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Abnormal elastogenesis, which showed no remarkable changes macroscopically or light microscopically, was systemic but segmental in the peripheral organ arteries, and regeneration of the structurally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elastin was concurrent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306863" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elastolysis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These events were diagnostic for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, and cannot be explained by the conventional theory of elastogenetic enzymic deficiency </plain></SENT>
