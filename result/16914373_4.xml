<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to identify individuals at risk for potentially lethal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> in athletes before competition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between June 2005 and July 2005, 351 (170 male and 181 female) elite Chinese athletes from 21 sports were profiled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 12-lead electrocardiogram and echocardiography were employed to evaluate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The vast majority had no definitive evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECGs</z:mp> were identified in 16 athletes (4.5%), including 4 with distinctly abnormal and 12 with mildly abnormal patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 13 athletes (3.7%) had echocardiographic evidence of relatively mild valve regurgitation that had not been previously suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In three athletes with relatively mild ventricular septal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> (13-14 mm), it was not possible to discern with absolute certainty whether the wall thickening was a manifestation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> or secondary to athletic conditioning ("athlete heart") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This screening protocol identified no athletes with definite evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> that convey a significant potential risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> or disease progression during athletic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is largely due to the relative low prevalence of conditions resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in young athletes and high false positive/negative rates in the tests used as part of the screening process (due to a large overlap between cardiovascular changes due to pathology and those due to intense training) </plain></SENT>
