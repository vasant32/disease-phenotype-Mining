<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ratio of males to females was 3:2 and the sixth and seventh decades of life were most frequently affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 11 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> were in patients under 40 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DeBakey's type III dissections showed a male predilection and more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> than in control cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Many patients with types I and II dissections died of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, while many patients with type III dissection died in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase, and half of the patients died of diseases other than <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was recognized in 73.7% of the 95 cases which showed no other obvious risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histologic examinations suggested that cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was related to the pathogenesis of the disease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, but was not so apparent in non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Laminar medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was found in many cases, but was considered to be a secondary ischemic change following dissection, as supported by other investigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were only a few cases in which dissection seemed to be directly caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
