<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ocular, skeletal and cardiovascular systems are mostly at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Principal complications of the disease are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy increases this risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the experience of our obstetrics department and after reviewing medical literature, we have tried to establish guidelines for obstetric care adapted to pregnant patients affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women with aortic root &gt; 40 mm should avoid pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases B-adrenergic receptor blockers must be used as soon as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because there is a 50% risk that offspring will inherit the syndrome, prenatal diagnosis should be suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition to usual pregnancy monitoring, echocardiography should be performed every 3 months as well as 2 months after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No increase of obstetrical complications has been shown in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Route of delivery also depends on the diameter of the aortic root: vaginal delivery is warranted if the aortic root is&lt;40; cesarean section should be performed in the other cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, with appropriate supervision, women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> will tolerate pregnancy without any adverse effect </plain></SENT>
