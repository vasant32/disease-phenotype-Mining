<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report a family with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> in whom a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo>; muscle biopsies from affected individuals were examined to determine whether there were abnormalities in fibrillin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 21 family members underwent detailed clinical examination, including neurological and pulmonary assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsies in the most severely affected cases were immunostained using monoclonal antibodies to specific fibrillin components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 21 members was analysed for mutations in the fibrillin gene, FBN1, on 15q21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 13 individuals had a C4621T base change in exon 37 of the FBN1 gene, which in four cases segregated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> or evidence of respiratory muscle dysfunction or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their muscle biopsies revealed an abnormality in fibrillin immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities in fibrillin can be detected in muscle biopsies from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This pedigree, with a point mutation in FBN1, also draws attention to the potential for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
