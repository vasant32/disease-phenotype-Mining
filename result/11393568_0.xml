<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>That division also helps to determine the sizes and shapes of joints, apophyses and epiphyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ideas about what controls those facts are changing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To former views, in which mainly genetic and humoral factors controlled them, the Utah paradigm of skeletal <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> adds long-overlooked biomechanical including muscular factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These three kinds of factors would collaborate in controlling the precursor cell division that determines the above skeletal features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Problems with that control clearly cause or help to cause many clinical disorders </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> such things depend on has matured sufficiently to justify a review for pediatricians, endocrinologists and other clinical specialists, and many basic scientists </plain></SENT>
