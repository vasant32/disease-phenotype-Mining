<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS OF THE STUDY: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>Aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> due to dilation of the aortic root is a common finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although combined replacement of the aortic valve and the ascending aorta is regarded as standard treatment, total replacement of the proximal aorta with a tube graft and resuspension of the valve is a new alternative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between June 1993 and June 1995, 23 patients underwent this type of aortic repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients exhibited the typical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography was performed pre- and intraoperatively as well as three, six and then every 12 months postoperatively for a cumulative follow up period of 355 months (5-30; mean 15.9 +/- 7.9 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The pre-existing <z:mp ids='MP_0006047'>aortic valve insufficiency</z:mp> (grade II-IV, mean 2.9) was reduced postoperatively to grade 0-1 (mean 0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The NYHA functional class improved from a mean of 2.8 to 1.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the follow up period 20 patients showed a stable valve function with either no (n = 13), or a mild valve regurgitation (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients had to be reoperated for progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> 11 and 14 months after repair, undergoing valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A third patient required reoperation because of relapsing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is concluded that in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0006047'>aortic valve insufficiency</z:mp> due to dilation of the proximal aorta, valve sparing reconstruction is a promising approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Without the need for anticoagulation, good functional results could be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further follow up is required to assess the long term function of this kind of aortic valve repair </plain></SENT>
