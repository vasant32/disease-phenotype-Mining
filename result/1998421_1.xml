<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This group of patients was analyzed to evaluate the outcome of those in whom the aortic valve was preserved compared with those having valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall preoperative characteristics of the two groups were similar except for the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Valve replacement was the elected procedure in patients with valve degeneration or annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with leaflet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> with or without an enlarged annulus, a plastic procedure was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 48% of the patients, it was possible to preserve the valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were five hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (11%): three were due to low-output syndrome, one was due to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and one was due to neurological complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were two late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up of the 37 surviving patients ranged from 2 to 108 months (mean follow-up, 18 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventy-eight percent of the survivors were in functional class I and the others were in class II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients in whom the aortic valve was preserved had mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three patients with bioprostheses underwent reoperation because of prosthetic valve dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient who had aortoplasty and an aortic valve plastic procedure was seen with redissection and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> after 60 months and was reoperated on using the Bentall technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival curves showed that patients who underwent valvoplasty had higher, but not significantly higher, survival rates than the valve replacement patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
