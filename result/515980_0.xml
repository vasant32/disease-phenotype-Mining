<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Between 1972 and 1978, 31 patients underwent replacement of the ascending aorta, with or without aortic valve surgery, at the Wessex Regional Cardiac Centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The commonest indications for operation were aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0005111'>dilatation of the ascending aorta</z:hpo> causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 31 patients had features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall hospital mortality was 19.4%, a figure comparable with those reported in other series; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849925" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ventricular failure</z:e> secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> during operation was the commonest cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The long-term symptomatic results were excellent, except in the two patients who underwent resuspension of the aortic valve for aortic regurgiation associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta with associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, replacement of the valve and ascending aorta with a combined valve prosthesis and synthetic tube graft, with reimplantation of the coronary ostia, is the procedure of choice if the aortic valve ring is diseased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Experience to date indicates that replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve with separate prostheses, leaving the coronary ostia undisturbed, is a satisfactory alternative provided the aortic annulus is of suitable size and quality; this is more likely to be the case in dissections than in aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0005111'>dilatation of the ascending aorta</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Replacement of the ascending aorta may also be indicated in some cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005111'>dilatation of the ascending aorta</z:hpo> secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e> if the aortic wall is unusually thin </plain></SENT>
