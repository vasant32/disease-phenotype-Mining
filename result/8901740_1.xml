<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, extended periods of CA may impair cerebral metabolism and cause ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies were performed to evaluate the efficacy of retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP) in protecting the brain from ischemic injury during a prolonged period of CA in moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (18 men and 5 women) were operated on for aortic lesions (17 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and 6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aortic operations were performed with CA (58 to 104 minutes; mean +/- SD, 75 +/- 12 minutes) at a rectal temperature of 23.3 +/- 0.5 degrees C (21 degrees C to 25 degrees C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For RCP, cold (14 degrees C to 18 degrees C) oxygenated blood (300 mL/min) was pumped to the superior vena cava with internal jugular venous pressure of 15 +/- 5 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cardiopulmonary bypass time was 157 +/- 18 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cortical blood flow during RCP detected by subdural laser Doppler probe was 10 +/- 5% of baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Percent oxygen extraction and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels (26 +/- 2% and 0.43 +/- 0.17 and 45 +/- 16 mg/dI) were insignificantly different from those before CA (28 +/- 3% and 0.71 +/- 0.08 and 62 +/- 20 mg/dL, P &gt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">Creatine</z:chebi> kinase-BB isoenzyme was undetectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but 1 patient survived the operation (95.5%) and woke up without neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Follow-up (mean, 13 months) was complete in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Cerebral functional studies performed 3 months after discharge showed results insignificantly different from those of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of the brain during prolonged moderate hypothermic CA with the aid of RCP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Retrograde cerebral perfusion effectively extends the safe time of CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> during CA seems unnecessary </plain></SENT>
