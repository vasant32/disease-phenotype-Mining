<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Current therapies for diseases of heart muscle (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>) and aorta (aortopathy) include inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35530">beta-adrenergic antagonists</z:chebi>, and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> class of cholesterol-lowering agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These therapies have limited efficacy, as adverse cardiovascular events continue to occur with some frequency in patients taking these drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and aortopathy can coexist in a number of conditions (for example, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000845'>acromegaly</z:hpo>, pregnancy, and aging), pathogenetic molecular links between the two diseases remain poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reasoned that identification of common molecular perturbations in these two tissues could point to therapies for both conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that deficiency of the transcriptional regulator Kruppel-like factor 15 (Klf15) in mice leads to both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> formation through a shared molecular mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Klf15 concentrations are markedly reduced in failing human hearts and in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mice deficient in Klf15 develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> in a p53-dependent and p300 acetyltransferase-dependent fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>KLF15 activation inhibits p300-mediated acetylation of p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, Klf15 deficiency leads to hyperacetylation of p53 in the heart and aorta, a finding that is recapitulated in human tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, Klf15-deficient mice are rescued by p53 deletion or p300 inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings highlight a molecular perturbation common to the pathobiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> formation and suggest that manipulation of KLF15 function may be a productive approach to treat these morbid diseases </plain></SENT>
