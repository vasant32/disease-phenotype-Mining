<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clinical and pathologic data were reviewed in 55 patients who had valve replacement for pure <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (AR) during a 6-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical histories established the cause for AR in 34 cases: 11 rheumatic, 13 infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, 4 congenital, 4 associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and 2 the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the valves from the other 21 patients, 13 had myxoid degeneration, defined as significant disruption of the valve fibrosa and its replacement by acid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37395">mucopolysaccharides</z:chebi> and cystic change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Myxoid degeneration was also the primary pathologic abnormality in the 2 patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, in 3 patients with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic disease</z:e> and in 1 patient with a history of infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients with myxoid degeneration of uncertain origin were predominantly elderly (average age 63 years), had a long-standing history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo> (77%) and had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (46%); 85% were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these patients the replacement valves were not larger than those of the other groups studied, indicating that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the aortic anulus was not a significant factor in the pathogenesis of the valve disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that myxoid degeneration of the aortic valve is common (36% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> valves examined) and, in many cases, may be secondary to long-standing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
