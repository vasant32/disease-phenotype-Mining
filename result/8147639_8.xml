<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed simultaneous graft replacement of the total aortic arch and ascending aorta for type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> with a patent false lumen extending through the arch into the descending or abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the past 7 years, this procedure was performed in 42 patients (28 men and 14 women), aged 20 to 72 years (mean age, 50 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients underwent the procedure during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> period, and 23 during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The site of the initial intimal tear was the ascending aorta in 17 patients and the transverse aortic arch in 25 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Artificial graft replacement was initially accomplished by proximal anastomosis, followed by open distal anastomosis, and finally by anastomosis of each of the three arch vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 3 hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (7.1%), 1 resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection (5.3%) and 2 from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection (8.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the type A dissections, total arch graft replacement has been indicated in the setting of rupture of the aortic arch, arch dissection, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, with increasing experience in arch reconstructions and improvement in outcome, the indications could be expanded to include <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> with a patent false lumen in the descending aorta </plain></SENT>
