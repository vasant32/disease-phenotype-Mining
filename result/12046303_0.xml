<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nineteen eyes of 13 patients were operatively treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>lens dislocation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pars plana vitrectomy was done in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>Dislocated lenses</z:hpo> were removed by lensectomy in 5 eyes and with an intracapsular method in 14 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The scleral fixation technique was used for primary posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation in 18 eyes, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> remained aphakic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Time of observation ranged between 6 and 71 months (mean 3.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eyes achieved improvement in visual acuity or good preoperative visual acuity was maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The vision between 6/6 and 6/8 was achieved in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no serious intraoperative or early postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>Retinal detachment</z:hpo> appeared in two eyes in a long observation time and it was successfully operatively treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The not good visual results were due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000646'>amblyopia</z:hpo> (n = 2), complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> surgery (n = 2) and glaucomatous optic disc <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> coexisting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000608'>macular degeneration</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pars plana vitrectomy and primary scleral-fixated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> implantation gives quick and good visual rehabilitation in adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The described surgical method is complex and need a prolonged operative time, but gives very good functional results and very few complications </plain></SENT>
