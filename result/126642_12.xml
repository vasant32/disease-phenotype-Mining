<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The coronary arteries of five hearts of patients known to have had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> were studied microscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In four of the five cases the extramural coronary arteries showed structural changes consisting of accumulations of acid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37395">mucopolysaccharides</z:chebi> and a concomitant disruption of the connective tissue elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These changes closely resembled the changes that frequently occur in the aorta and that are generally described as "cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They are considered to be an important expression of wall weakening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one case a laceration, probably traumatic, of a coronary artery led to formation of an "incomplete dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>." "Cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>" was found once in the proximal segment of the sinus nodal artery and once in the musculoelastic layer of a coronary artery that reached the atrioventricular node from the ventricular septum by perforating the anulus fibrosus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in contrast to findings in a previous report, the intramural coronary arteries were otherwise unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of these data is as yet unknown particularly since these alterations are intramural and initially do not cause narrowing of the lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the possibility of coronary arterial involvement by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorder</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> should always be considered during clinical assessment of this lesion </plain></SENT>
