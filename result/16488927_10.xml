<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate dilatory changes of the aorta distal to the root in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Data of 268 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> who were enrolled in the Euro Heart Survey on adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data used for this study were baseline characteristics, diameters at four levels of the aorta and events during follow up (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340643" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dissection, aortic</z:e> repairs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At inclusion, 26 patients had a previous dissection and 53 patients without a previous dissection had undergone elective aortic repair, thus leaving 189 patients without previous dissection or repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During follow up (median 5.4 years), four patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 46 aortic events (dissection or elective surgery) occurred in 45 patients, in the distal aorta in 14 patients (31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline aortic diameter at the levels distal to the root (arch, descending aorta and abdominal aorta) was greater in patients with than in those without a previous elective aortic root intervention (median 26 mm v 24 mm, p = 0.01; 25 mm v 20 mm, p &lt; 0.01; and 20 mm v 17 mm, p &lt; 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that a previous elective aortic intervention was associated with a fourfold increased probability of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the distal aorta, after adjustment for age and sex (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients without a previous intervention, the baseline diameter of the descending aorta was an independent predictor of aortic events (hazard ratio 3.0 per quartile, 95% CI 1.5 to 5.9, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cause for concern is that complete measurements of the aorta (at least one measurement at each level at baseline or during follow up) were available for only 38% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Almost one in every three aortic events occurring during follow up of these patients involved the distal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After elective aortic root replacement, a dilated distal aorta is more common than before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, an increased diameter of the descending aorta is associated with a higher risk of aortic events in patients without previous dissection or aortic root replacement, independent of the diameter of the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Careful monitoring of the entire aorta is essential for the optimal management of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, especially after elective surgery, but is insufficiently performed in Europe </plain></SENT>
