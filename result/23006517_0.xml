<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic dissection</z:hpo> is a life-threatening manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preliminary evidence suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> (OSA) is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Objectives: To study the effect of OSA on aortic events in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods: In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, a sleep study was performed at baseline and OSA was defined as &gt;5 events of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>/<z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> (A+H) per hour in bed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Operation because of progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003496" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic rupture</z:e> were defined as 'aortic events' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to compare event-free survival in patients with and without OSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox regression models were used to explore the effects of covariates on event-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results: Data from 44 patients (mean age 37.4 years, 30 females) were available for analysis; 15 patients (34.1%) had OSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up time was 29 (interquartile range 24-36) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients had an aortic event within the follow-up time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median event-free survival was 51.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival was significantly shorter in patients with OSA compared to patients without OSA (p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, A+H was associated with aortic events [hazard ratio (HR) 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.18, p = 0.023] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Taking the interaction between BMI and A+H into account increased the HR for A+H (HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.003-3.048, p = 0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This association was no longer significant when other covariates were forced into the multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: These data suggest that aortic event-free survival may be shorter in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and OSA compared to patients without OSA, but more data from well-designed studies are needed to prove this association </plain></SENT>
