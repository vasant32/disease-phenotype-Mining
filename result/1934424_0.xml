<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients had stigmata of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, and 15 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> showed annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up ranged from 1 to 16 years (mean, 5.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were six early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (14%) and seven late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (16%), with actuarial survival at 10 years of 65 +/- 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were mostly related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> occurring in the remainder of the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patient has undergone reoperation related to the composite graft, but six patients required seven subsequent operations on the remaining aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The actuarial probability of freedom from late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and subsequent operation at 8 years was 64 +/- 9% for the operative survivors, but it was 44 +/- 17% for the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and 37 +/- 19% for those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative angiography performed 3-168 months (mean, 42 months) postoperatively in 23 nonselective patients demonstrated recurrent true <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> at both or one of the coronary ostia (seven), persistent dissection distal to the distal aortic anastomosis (five), pseudoaneurysm at the left coronary ostium (one), pseudoaneurysm due to a small leak at the proximal aortic anastomosis (one), and partial dehiscence of the distal aortic suture line (one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Composite graft replacement carries a potential risk of various late complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data support the concept that earlier detection and aggressive treatment of the late complications occurring in the remainder of the diseased aorta is necessary to improve long-term survival after the Bentall operation </plain></SENT>
