<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL: A total of 240 patients who presented with the diagnosis of one of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were examined and, in 182 of them, the findings were completed to meet the criteria required by differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Revised criteria were used for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> (EDS), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteogenesis imperfecta</z:e> (OI), juvenile idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> (JIO), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000973'>cutis laxa</z:hpo> (CL) or benign articular hyperelasticity (BAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients provided their medical histories, and underwent clinical, radiological, anthropometric, echocardiographic and biochemical examinations, including that for markers of bone formation and resorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The anteroposterior bulb length was assessed by ultrasonography; densitomery was performed and vital capacity was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> data obtained were processed by computer software and the definitive diagnosis was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 82 patients initially diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>, only 43 (52.4%) met the revised criteria; of the 53 EDS patients initially, 30 (56.6%) met the revised criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients who had been referred to us with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> were found to meet the criteria for EDS (two) and OI (two) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Out of 35 patients with OI, 22 (62.8%) met the diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 24 patients with BAH were confirmed to have this diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the revised criteria, none of the patients was diagnosed as having JIO or CL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The authors compare their results of decreased levels of procollagen I, the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> or acetabular protrusion and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002792'>reduced vital capacity</z:hpo> with the relevant reports in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The specific criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>lens dislocation</z:hpo> or an anteroposterior bulb axis longer than 24 mm, ascending <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo>, greater body height and the ratio of lower extremities to the body and that of arm-span to height higher than 1.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, some criteria, such as the metacarpal-phalangeal index, are not characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> only and, therefore, cannot be regarded as a major diagnostic feature of this disorder </plain></SENT>
