<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two types are differentiated: the "hypertensive" and the "Marfan" types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The former is characterized by moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> and considerable blood pressure elevation, the latter by considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The role of wall stress in the development of the intimal tear and the propagation of the process of dissection are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We recommend that patients who are at high risk for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>--those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and dilated aortas--should undergo aortoplasty and wall reinforcement as a simple, safe, and effective way to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
