<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the safety and the effectiveness of endovascular stent grafting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (AD) in Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AD of the descending thoracic aorta (DTA) is challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is especially true in Marfan patients, who tend to exhibit poor short- and long-term results after conventional surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AD of the DTA were identified among the 457 patients of the European Talent Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No major adverse event was encountered during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients experienced a primary endoleak (type 1, n = 4; type 2, n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of them died, and 1 underwent successful conversion to open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five other patients experienced secondary endoleak (type 1, n = 4; type 3, n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four of them underwent successful conversion to either open or endovascular reintervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two other patients underwent successful conversion to open repair because of secondary aortic enlargement below the stent graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 2.1 +/- 1.4 years, 12 patients are alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of these 12, conversion to open repair was successfully performed in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 7 patients, complete <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the false lumen was achieved in 6 patients, with partial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular stent grafting of the dissected DTA is feasible in selected Marfan patients with low mortality and morbidity rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the rate of primary and secondary endoleak is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Close imaging surveillance is crucial to detect secondary aortic complications and to assess long-term results </plain></SENT>
