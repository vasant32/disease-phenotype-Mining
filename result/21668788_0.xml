<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Randomized case series in the State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-<z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eyes</z:mp> of 49 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> with subluxated lens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a randomized case series of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> and subluxated lenses who underwent phaco-emulsification combined with scleral-fixated posterior chamber intraocular lens or iris-fixated anterior chamber intraocular lens implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The evaluation indexes included the surgery time, best corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, aqueous flare and cells counts, corneal endothelium counts and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increase in best corrected visual acuity in both groups was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aqueous flare and cells rose in both groups postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant difference between the two groups at 1 week postoperatively was found, whereas no statistically significant difference was found later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The loss rate of corneal endothelium cells in the scleral-fixated posterior chamber intraocular lens group was 13.2% and 19.5% at 3 months and 1 year postoperatively, which in the iris-fixated anterior chamber intraocular lens group was 13.3% and 19.3% (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>Prolapse</z:mpath> of vitreous was found in 21 cases intraoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1444680" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">posterior capsule opacification</z:e> rate was 32% and 15%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The decentration of the intraocular lens was found in 19 eyes (48.7%) in the scleral-fixated posterior chamber intraocular lens group 1 year postoperatively, whereas none was found in the iris-fixated anterior chamber intraocular lens group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Iris-fixated anterior chamber intraocular lens after phaco-emulsification presented a safe, simple and efficient approach for managing subluxated lens in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
