<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>37 patients were examined at the average age of 11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>32 showed a spinal deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treatment of the spinal deformity was a brace in 15 cases, surgery in 16 cases (including 5 cases after brace-failure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>7 cases were just followed-up without treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bracing was efficient only for mild curves, this treatment was satisfying 4 times out of 11 with adequate follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The surgical treatment in 16 cases was a posterior fusion twice associated with anterior fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We used the same technique as for idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> with Harrington instrumentation 5 times, Harrington with sublaminar wires 4 times and Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation 7 times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> was achieved in 48.2 per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The use of segmental instrumentation compared with the use of the Harrington instrumentation can explain the small number of non unions and the improvement of the lateral spinal balance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We did not note any cardiovascular complication during or early after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Aortic lesions were responsible of one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the long term, three patients went through a surgical replacement of aortic valves or the aorta </plain></SENT>
