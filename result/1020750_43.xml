<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 53 patients the dissection occurred in the ascending aorta ("proximal" dissection), and in 71 patients the site of origin was the descending thoracic aorta ("distal" dissection) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Certain distinct clinical differences between the groups were apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was an important predisposing factor, it was significantly more common in distal dissection, as was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>Back pain</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> on hospital presentation characterized patients with distal dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely patients with proximal dissection were younger and had a significantly higher incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, anterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>, pulse deficits, neurologic compromise, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both groups, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> appeared to correlate well with the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac tamponade</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chest roentgenograms almost always showed an abnormal aortic contour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aortic angiography, when performed, was usually confirmatory of the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
