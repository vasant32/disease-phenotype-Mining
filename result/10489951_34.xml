<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Early identification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> is fundamental in the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo>, but the wide phenotypic expression of the disorder makes the clinical diagnosis very difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>Dural ectasia</z:hpo> has been classified as a major diagnostic criterion; however, its prevalence is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify the true prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, and to investigate its relation to aortic pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A magnetic-resonance-imaging (MRI) study of the thoracic aorta and of the lumbosacral spine was done in an inclusive series of 83 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> to assess the presence and degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> and aortic involvement; 12 patients were younger than 18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>100 individuals who underwent MRI of the lumbar spine for routine clinical indications represented the control group; none of them had any potential causes for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>Dural ectasia</z:hpo> was identified in 76 (92%) patients and none of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> was related to age; the mean (SD) age of patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> was 26 years (14) whereas that of those with severe disease (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002435'>meningocele</z:hpo>) was 36 years (9) (p=0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>11 of 12 patients younger than 18 years had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No association was found between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>Dural ectasia</z:hpo> is a highly characteristic sign of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, even at an early age </plain></SENT>
