<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Topical thrombin spray is frequently used as a hemostatic agent in surgery, particularly following cardiovascular, orthopedic and neurologic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Acquired coagulation factor inhibitors to thrombin and factor V may develop following gynecologic surgery with repeat topical thrombin use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE: A 45-year-old woman underwent total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Her past medical history included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and past surgery included splenectomy and aortic valve replacement with a three-vessel coronary artery bypass graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She was converted from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">Coumadin</z:chebi> (DuPont Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, Delaware) to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> preoperatively, and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was stopped six hours before surgery, with normalization of her prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Topical bovine thrombin spray was applied to the surgical field in anticipation of early resumption of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven days after surgery, after recovering from some <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> problems, the patient began to have elevation of her PT in spite of being off <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">Coumadin</z:chebi> for 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Her PT and international normalized ratio (INR) continued to rise, reaching peak values of 31.4 and 6.99, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A mixing study did not correct the problem, confirming the presence of coagulation inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patient was given intravenous immunoglobulins and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, and her PT/PTT and INR values slowly normalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Acquired coagulation factor may develop following gynecologic surgery with topical thrombin use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This potential complication should be strongly considered in any patient prior to using topical bovine thrombin, especially those with a prior exposure or history of surgical procedures in which bovine thrombin is commonly used </plain></SENT>
