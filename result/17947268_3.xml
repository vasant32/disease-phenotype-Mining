<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the visual outcomes, intraoperative and postoperative complications of Cionni ring implantation in eyes with a subluxated lens associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This case series included 15 eyes of 12 patients aged 19-56 years with a subluxated lens secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> operataed at the Departament of Ophtalmology, Toronto Western Hospital between 2003 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 2-eyelet Cionni ring and an AcrySof (Alcon) foldable intraocular lens (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e>) were implanted in 13 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two eyes had trans-scleral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> fixation in the ciliary sulcus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Best-corrected visual acuity, wavefront evaluation of eye aberration and complication rates were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eyes, capsular bag centration was excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preoperative visual acuity ranged from 20/50 to counting fingers, and improved to better than 20/40 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up duration was 14+/-9.49 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequent postoperative complication was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1444680" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">posterior capsule opacification</z:e>, which occurred in 3 eyes (18.7%), 2 of which required a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="33372">neodymium</z:chebi>:YAG posterior capsulotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No eye developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Total eye aberration, tilt and high-order aberrations with a 6-mm pupil diameter decreased significantly after surgery (n = 5): Total eye aberration decreased from a mean of 14.8+/-5.5 preoperatively to 2.1+/-4.3 microns after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Tilt was decreased from 4.1+/-2.5 to 0.12+/-2.1 microns, and high-order aberrations decreased from 4.37+/-3.8 microns, before the operation, to 1.47+/-3.5 after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cionni ring implantation is an effective procedure to correct partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001132'>lens subluxation</z:hpo> and has few complications (during 14 months of follow-up) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's Syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
