<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> is associated with a high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> (OSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As this syndrome is associated with a characteristic constricted maxilla and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000156'>high-arched palate</z:hpo>, we reasoned that nasal airway constriction and resultant high nasal airway resistance (NAR) may contribute to the development of OSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to measure NAR in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we aimed to examine the influence of maxillary <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> on both NAR and the severity of OSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We measured NAR in 13 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and 13 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NAR was measured by posterior rhinomanometry, and expressed as the inspiratory resistance at a flow of 0.5 L/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dental impressions were taken to evaluate maxillary arch <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, allowing measurement of the following distances: intercuspid (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>), interpremolar (IPD), intermolar (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16069">IMD</z:chebi>), and maximum hard palate height (MPH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten of the patients and four of the control subjects had previously undergone nocturnal polysomnography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean NAR for the Marfan group was more than twice that in the control group (7.7 +/- 1.2 vs 2.9 +/- 0.4 cm <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi>/L/s; p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients also had marked constriction of the maxillary arch compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two of the lateral maxillary measurements were significantly inversely correlated with NAR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were significant correlations between various maxillary arch measurements (MPH/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>, MPH/IPD, MPH/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16069">IMD</z:chebi>) and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>/<z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest that high NAR is a common feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Maxillary constriction with a relatively high hard palate appears to be a major reason for the high NAR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The significant correlations between indexes of maxillary constriction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> severity suggest that maxillary <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> may play an important role in the pathophysiology of OSA in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
