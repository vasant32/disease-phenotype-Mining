<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess the value of transoesophageal echocardiography in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> particularly those with suspected aortic pathology or where conventional transthoracic imaging was suboptimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Eleven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven patients were studied because of suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and four because of inadequate transthoracic imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Transoesophageal echocardiography and colour Doppler flow mapping by a 5 MHz single plane transoesophageal probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>Aortic dissection</z:hpo> was identified in six patients with subsequent diagnostic confirmation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No dissection was found in one patient in whom the diagnosis had been suspected clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Estimates of aortic root dimensions and assessment of aortic and mitral valve pathology were made in four other patients with inadequate transthoracic imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transoesophageal echocardiography provides rapid diagnostic information in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and enhances the assessment of cardiovascular manifestations of this condition </plain></SENT>
