<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 20 year (1963 to 1982) surgical experience including 175 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> was analyzed by logistic discriminant analyses to identify predictors of high operative risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient population had characteristics similar to those in large autopsy series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine percent had type A and 58% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intimal tear was located in the ascending aorta in 60% of the patients, the descending aorta in 27%, and the transverse arch in 13% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall operative mortality rate was 23 +/- 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The operative mortality rates were substantially lower between 1977 and 1982: mortality in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissections, 7 +/- 5%; in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type A, 11 +/- 7%; in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B, 13 +/- 12%; and in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type B, 11 +/- 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After preliminary univariate screening, the following factors were determined to be significant independent predictors of operative mortality (in rank order of declining predictive power): type A patients (n = 121), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo>, tamponade, renal/visceral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and operative date; type B patients (n = 54), rupture, renal/visceral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and age; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (n = 175), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo>, renal/visceral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, site of tear (ascending less than descending less than arch), tamponade, operative date, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, several variables had no important bearing on operative mortality, including type (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vs <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>) of dissection, age, previous operation, rupture, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, concomitant aortic valve replacement and/or coronary artery bypass grafting, site of tear, and whether or not the tear was resected in type A patients; emergency operation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, previous cardiac symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo>, site of tear, and resection of tear in type B patients; and, when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were considered together, age, sex, cardiac symptoms, prior operation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, and tear resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data allow calculation of any individual patient's operative risk and document that the operative mortality rate today is relatively low for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo>, irrespective of type or acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Earlier surgical referral of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B dissection before irreversible major end-organ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and/or infarction is probably in part responsible for the substantially improved results since 1977 </plain></SENT>
