<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This implies a characteristic different from the proportions in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult man, in whom span and height are often thought to be equal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such equality of span and height, which allows man to be portrayed within a square, has been a widely held concept, immortalised by Leonardo da Vinci, that dates from the Roman Vitruvius </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in the past two hundred years, anthropometry has shown that span exceeds height in 59-78% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult white men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus not only is the classic concept of equality of span and height generally incorrect, but also a span greater than height cannot be considered characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, in some affected individuals, Vitruvian equality of height and span may occur </plain></SENT>
