<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our surgical strategy for this disease is "limited aortic resection", that is to avoid replacement of the entire arch except for the patients with arch tear that cannot be resected without total arch replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were one operative mortality due to post transfusion GVHD, and ten late mortality (rupture of the residual dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> 3; complication of the late reoperation 3; cerebrovascular disease 2; <z:hpo ids='HP_0006532'>pulmonary infection</z:hpo> 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases is 92.9%, 62.9%, and 58.4% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparing the patients whose primary tear was resected or not resected, there was no difference in the rate of residual dissection (12/16, 75% vs 5/6, 83.3%; primary tear resected vs not resected), the rate of late reoperation (3/16, 18.8% vs 1/6, 16.7%), nor actuarial survival rate (90.5% vs 100%, 66.7% vs %, 53.6% vs 71.4%, at 1, 5, 10 years, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were three cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases died of the rupture of the residual dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We will follow the policy of the "limited aortic resection" unless the operative mortality of the entire arch replacement is proved as good as that of the ascending or hemiarch replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of the poor late results of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, entire arch replacement at the initial surgery and aggressive reoperation for the residual dissection is necessary </plain></SENT>
