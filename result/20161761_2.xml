<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Fibrillins 1 (FBN1) and 2 (FBN2) are components of microfibrils, microfilaments that are present in many connective tissues, either alone or in association with elastin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and congenital contractural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo> (CCA) result from dominant mutations in the genes FBN1 and FBN2 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with both conditions often present with specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle atrophy</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, yet this has not been reported in the mouse models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the case of Fbn1, this is due to <z:mp ids='MP_0002081'>perinatal lethality</z:mp> of the homozygous null mice making measurements of strength difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the case of Fbn2, four different mutant alleles have been described in the mouse and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> was reported as the defining phenotypic feature of homozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: As part of a large-scale <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23995">N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23995">ENU</z:chebi>) mutagenesis screen, we identified a mouse mutant, Mariusz, which exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> along with hindlimb <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identified an amber nonsense mutation in Fbn2 in this mouse mutant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Examination of a previously characterised Fbn2-null mutant, Fbn2(fp), identified a similar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The two Fbn2 mutant alleles complement each other confirming that the <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> is the result of a lack of Fbn2 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscle from mutants proved to be abnormal with higher than average numbers of fibres with centrally placed nuclei, an indicator that there are some regenerating muscle fibres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Physiological tests indicated that the mutant muscle produces significantly less maximal force, possibly as a result of the muscles being relatively smaller in Mariusz mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that Fbn2 is involved in integrity of structures required for strength in limb movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As human patients with mutations in the fibrillin genes FBN1 and FBN2 often present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> as a symptom, Fbn2-null mice will be a useful model for examining this aspect of the disease process further </plain></SENT>
