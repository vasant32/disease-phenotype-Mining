<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The indications, surgical techniques and complications are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During a 10-year period, 99 saphenous vein grafts and 3 radial artery grafts were performed for 101 patients, i.e., 72 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, 23 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and 6 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up monitoring of the patients was by direct examination or telephone interview, with a mean follow-up period of 41.2 months (range, 5-147 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Radiological follow-up monitoring was by magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, or three-dimensional computed tomographic angiography, with a mean follow-up period of 32 months (range, 1-120 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, there was one late graft occlusion and one graft stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The use of intraoperative angiography improved the patency rate from 90 to 98% and reduced the incidence of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from 13 to 9.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ninety-two percent of the patients were in excellent or good neurological condition at the time of discharge from the hospital, compared with 95% before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The perioperative mortality rate was 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other complications included three intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp>, rupture of a vein graft in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, and five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resection-related problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The long-term survival rates for patients who received grafts were excellent for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086692" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">benign tumors</z:e>, fair to poor for patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp>, good for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and excellent for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of saphenous vein and radial artery grafting have been greatly improved by the use of intraoperative angiography, improvements in surgical techniques, and improved perioperative treatment </plain></SENT>
