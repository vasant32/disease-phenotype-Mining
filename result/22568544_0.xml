<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> (PE) is a deep chest wall deformity that generates both a cosmetic damage and a cardiac/respiratory function impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Excluding the scarce reports on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos</z:e>'s syndrome (EDS), few studies have examined the relation between severe PE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to verify the clinical significance of such correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Ninety-two consecutive patients, of whom 79 were males, between 6 and 34 years old, classified as having severe PE, were seen at our institution from June 2005 to September 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent clinical, ophthalmological, cardiac, and radiological (chest and spine magnetic resonance imaging) screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The following features were observed: skin stretch marks, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001382'>joint hypermobility</z:hpo>, echocardiographic signs, spinal defects, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Classical connectivopathies such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> or EDS were present in only 5 patients (approximately 5%), whereas a single deformity was present in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The largest group (approximately 71%) was represented by phenotypical alterations such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, aortic root enlargement, and skeletal and skin alterations (MASS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among those patients, the most frequent clinical manifestations were the skeletal ones, followed by skin marks and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PE showed an evident association with an array of features that we describe as MASS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although not one of this subgroup of patients has been described with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>increased aortic root diameter</z:hpo> when screened (a feature widely present in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients), they probably would require a thorough and longer follow-up than those affected by isolated PE because of the potential occurrence of severe cardiovascular complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and dissection, which are major causes of morbidity and mortality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
