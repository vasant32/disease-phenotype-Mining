<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Very few of these events fall under the genetic category such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers Danlos</z:e> type IV or Loeys Dietz syndrome and the vast majority follows the rules of other catastrophic vascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The evidence is mounting that these catastrophes do not happen at random </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This brief review looks at the evidence regarding a circadian, seasonal and weekly rhythm particularly of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> but also other vascular events including their association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086209" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional stress</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The recent surge of interest in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic diseases</z:e> and particularly the establishment of the IRAD registry have lead to new insights and clarification of these events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While hormonal associations with vascular events have been known for more than thirty years, modern molecular examinations about regulatory pathways are mostly still lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The steering of circadian variation is accepted but poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the basis of vascular neuroimmunological observations, speculations regarding micro environmental regulatory pathways are offered </plain></SENT>
