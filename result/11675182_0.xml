<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The surgical strategies for proximal repair in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection may not the same as those for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed our 10-year experience of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> in order to elucidate the validity of valve preservation and the long-term results of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (AR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1990 to 1999, 93 patients (55 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and 38 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissections) underwent operation for type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five Marfan patients were included in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of AR was evaluated by echocardiography before and after (at hospital discharge and late follow-up) operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (n=55), 16 patients had AR grade II or greater (29%), of whom seven had AR grade III (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 29 patients, dissection was found below the sinotubular junction (STJ) and 14 patients had AR grade II or greater (48%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The aortic valve was replaced in four patients (7%), of whom three had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only one non-Marfan patient required aortic valve replacement because of valve stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In those whose aortic valve was preserved (n=51), three patients still had AR grade II at hospital discharge, while at late follow-up, AR had deteriorated to grade III in two of them, although no reoperation has been required so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (n=38), 14 patients had AR grade II or greater (37%), of whom 11 had AR grade III or greater (29% vs. 13% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection; P=0.051) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 15 patients, dissection was found below the STJ and 12 patients had AR grade II or greater (80% vs. 48% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection; P=0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The aortic valve was replaced in eight patients (21% vs. 7% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection; P=0.051), including three Marfan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Of those whose aortic valve was preserved (n=30), two patients required reoperation for severe AR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The freedom from postoperative AR grade III or greater was 89% at 5 years for operative survivors with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection and 92% for those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective study suggests that preservation of the aortic valve in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> is feasible in non-Marfan patients regardless of the degree of AR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340643" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dissection, aortic</z:e> root replacement needs to be considered when the degree of AR is greater than moderate because of a dilated STJ and/or annulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissections, satisfactory mid- to long-term results with a low incidence of reoperation were obtained in those whose aortic valve was preserved </plain></SENT>
