<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report 2 missense mutations occur in calcium-binding Epidermal Growth Factor-like (EGFcb) domains and 9 polymorphisms located both in coding and noncoding regions of FBN1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three intragenic microsatellite polymorphic markers MTS-1, MTS-2 and MTS-4 have been analyzed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> and unrelated unaffected control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found significant differences in allele frequency distribution of MTS-2 and MTS-4 loci between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> patients and unaffected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Haplotype frequency distribution on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and mutant chromosomes were significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common haplotype was 2-11-8 which was predominant on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomes of affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haplotype 2-2-8 was observed in 18% of cases on mutant chromosomes and in 4% of cases on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate possibility and application of haplotype-segregation analysis with use of these intragenic markers for diagnostic purposes in affected families by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
