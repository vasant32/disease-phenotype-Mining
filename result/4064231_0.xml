<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The etiologic assessment that had been made on the person of a young girl revealed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003179'>protrusio acetabuli</z:hpo> which was painful and stiff and the evolution of which was quick, was allowed us to reveal a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On this occasion, we have studied the links between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003179'>protrusio acetabuli</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After having resumed the history of this illness, the author remind us of its main characteristics while insisting upon the orthopedic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They define the three steps of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003179'>protrusio acetabuli</z:hpo> according to the Ruelle and Dubois criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the child, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003179'>protrusio acetabuli</z:hpo> is said to be primary without any well determined etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, numerous studies deal with the idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0343263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chondrolysis</z:e> of the hips and describe surprising associations such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo>, deformations of the hands and hereditary characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve observations of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> are presented, eleven of which concerning children and one concerning an adult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among these twenty-four hips, the authors find nineteen protrude hips (80%) which belong to one of the three steps described by Ruelle and Dubois </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is an absence of clinical symptoms in nine cases among the twelve observed and the protrusion is systematically found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In three cases, there existed a functional symptomatology which in two cases, has led us to reveal a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were great pains of the mechanical type, linked to a limitation of the articular mobility; the radiography revealed an idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0343263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chondrolysis</z:e> of the hips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the authors underline the primary importance of the skin-biopsy and of the metacarpal index measure in order to confirm the diagnostic of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003179'>protrusio acetabuli</z:hpo> appear to be a quasiconstant sign of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and has to be included in the long check of the orthopedic abnormalities of such a syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The verification of a deep hip needs to research of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003179'>protrusio acetabuli</z:hpo> has to be closely studied, since we have just showed that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> was one its rare etiologies known up to now </plain></SENT>
