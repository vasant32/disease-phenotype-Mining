<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This suggests that there is considerable phenotypic heterogeneity associated with mutations in these genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a congenital heart defect in patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, this study was conducted to investigate whether variants in TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 are responsible for sporadic BAV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of these genes in 35 patients with BAVs identified only known single-nucleotide polymorphisms or novel synonymous or intronic substitutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, mutations in TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 rarely cause sporadic BAV </plain></SENT>
