<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MRI studies were always performed on patients who had been examined by other imaging procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A comparative study was carried out on the results of MRI, angiography, computerized tomography, and ultrasounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The possibility of propedeutic protocol was explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our experience, in accordance with the literature on the subject, indicates MRI as the procedure of choice in the study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The advantages offered by MRI--the high natural contrast between circulating blood and the supporting structures, the possibility of obtaining multiplanar images as well as data on intraluminal, parietal, and extraparietal conditions--make it a highly competitive procedure if compared to either CT or angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While awaiting further evidence, the use of a propedeutic protocol in non-aneurysmatic diseases is still not advisable, due to insufficient patient population, and to the lack of a consistent literature on the subject </plain></SENT>
