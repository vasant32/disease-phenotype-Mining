<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 1986 and 2003 a total of 30 patients with AA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were operated on at the clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insufficiency of the aortic valve with degree II-III regurgitation was present in 25 (83.3%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> dissection of the AA was identified in 10 (33.3%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient's age varied from 24 to 52 years (mean 39 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The etiological factors of AA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (46.7% of cases), Erdheim's syndrome (26.7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (10.0% of cases); previous chest traumas were recognized in 16.6% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were operated on under extra-corporeal circulation and moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients were distributed into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the control group, eighteen patients were operated on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy was carried out using unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> i. v. in a daily dose 10-15 thousand units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> injection was initiated on the first postoperative day and continued for 6.5 days on the average, with a progressive change over to the use of indirect <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the basic group, twelve operated patients were administered the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> enoxaparin s.c. in a daily dose 0.7-1.0 mg/kg bw </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Enoxaparin therapy was initiated from the first postoperative day and continued for 8.9 days on the average, with a progressive change over to indirect <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> in the control group accounted for 22.2% (4 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In two cases, it was induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and in two cases, by hemorrhagic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the basic group, the beneficial results were achieved in 91.7%; no hemorrhagic complications were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The data obtained allow the conclusion that the use of enoxaparin significantly facilitates the postoperative management of patients with AA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, providing for a controllable and safe <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> effect </plain></SENT>
