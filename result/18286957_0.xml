<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report the clinical features and long-term visual results in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> after lensectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed with the records of 78 eyes of 42 patients operated on and observed for at least 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age at diagnosis was 4.6 years, mean age at surgery was 5.7 years, and follow-up period was an average of 7.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 42 patients exhibiting bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo>, 6 received monocular surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean age at diagnosis was significantly higher and mean postoperative best-corrected visual acuity was significantly lower in the monocular surgery group than in the binocular surgery group (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eyes exhibited reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000540'>hyperopia</z:hpo> for 5 years postoperatively, but the reduction rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000540'>hyperopia</z:hpo> in the monocular group was significantly lower than inthe binocular group (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No complications occurred during operations and 1 eye (1.3%) in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> 9 years after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>ectopia lentis</z:hpo> was safe and promising with regard to good visual outcomes after 7.1 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the possibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000646'>amblyopia</z:hpo> must be considered due to differences in the degree of dislocation between the two eyes </plain></SENT>
