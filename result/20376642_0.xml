<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Whereas aortic valve replacement (AVR) is an effective treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo>, aortic valve repair (AVr) is an excellent alternative to AVR for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> (AI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The advantages of AVr include a lower risk of infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, plus avoidance of typical complications associated with mechanical valves (i.e., thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications) and bioprostheses (i.e., structural valve deterioration) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, AVr is technically more demanding, surgical techniques vary from center to center, and outcomes are variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As experience accrues, the indications for AVr continue to expand in some centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Careful preoperative evaluation and intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) are necessary for proper patient selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ideal patient is young or middle-aged, does not require multiple concomitant cardiac procedures, has a dilated aortic sinotubular junction (STJ) and/or root, and pliable AV cusps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A standardized pathology- directed approach helps achieve reproducible outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A <z:mp ids='MP_0010470'>dilated ascending aorta</z:mp>/STJ is treated with simple replacement of the ascending aorta with plication of the STJ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dilated aortic sinuses of Valsalva are treated with a valve-sparing root replacement, either a David reimplantation or a Yacoub remodeling procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aortic cusp pathology may be treated with cusp plication, triangular resection, or patch closure of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The dilated aortic annulus and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> patients are optimally treated with a David procedure.The perioperative results significantly influence long-term outcomes, emphasizing the importance of postrepair TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Using a standardized approach with careful patient selection, an 85-95% survival, a 90-95% freedom from reoperation, and an 80-90% freedom from moderate to severe AI may be expected at 8-10 years postoperatively </plain></SENT>
