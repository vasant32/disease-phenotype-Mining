<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Tube graft replacement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> requires no coronary anastomoses and preserves the native aortic valve, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> or aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> may develop requiring reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Use of Bentall or Cabrol composite valve graft procedures obviates these problems but requires prosthetic valve replacement and coronary reattachment, both of which are associated with complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These two procedures have been applied increasingly but because of renewed interest in aortic valve preservation and reconstruction, the authors determined in which patients tube replacement could be used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors analyzed the fate of 277 patients, mean age 49 +/- 14 years, operated on between 1953 and 1992 by techniques that preserved the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common pathology was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in 104 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perioperative mortality since 1975 was 14% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen patients required reoperation on the ascending aorta or aortic root; ascending <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> reoperation (6 patients); aortic valve replacement (8 patients), and a combined procedure (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these 15 patients, 8 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, 10 had dissections, and 5 had medial degeneration/<z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Simple tube graft replacement of the ascending aorta was a durable technique in patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> or medial degeneration/<z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and allowed preservation of the native aortic valve in many patients </plain></SENT>
