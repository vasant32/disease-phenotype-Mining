<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He had not manifested <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> previously in any position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under anesthesia with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9536">thiamylal</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9939">vecuronium</z:chebi>, his trachea was intubated with a reinforced endotracheal tube without any difficulty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anesthesia was maintained with nitrous <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and fentanyl, 8 micrograms.kg-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient was placed in a prone position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty min after the start of operation, when orthopedists compressed the thoracic vertebrae vertically, positive pressure ventilation became impossible abruptly, even with a high airway pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three min later, ventilation became possible after cessation of compression and by mouth-to-tube insufflation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SpO2 monitored with a pulse oximeter recovered immediately from 61% to 99% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A capnogram showed a lengthy retardation of an inspiratory phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Emergency fibreoptic bronchoscopy revealed that the trachea had been compressed vertically; the compression was reduced by moving the chest supporters laterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After the apneic episode, the operation continued uneventfully, and he was discharged a month later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A severe deformity of the thorax due to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> and weak tracheal tissue due to connective tissue defect caused partial tracheal compression before the surgery, and made his trachea susceptible to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">complete obstruction</z:e> by vertical external compression on the thorax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> should have careful preoperative airway evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The selection and positioning of endotracheal tubes should be done with care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>During surgery, the patient's body position and the condition of the trachea should be checked frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Capnography and fiberoptic bronchoscopy seem to be mandatory for early detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002777'>tracheal stenosis</z:hpo> and prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340221" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tracheal obstruction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
