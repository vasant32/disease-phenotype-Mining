<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report here the management of labor for a 33-year-old woman with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She was diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> at the age of 5 and experienced corrective surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> at 28 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As there was no progression of cardiovascular lesion, she was allowed to be pregnant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She was planned to proceed with vaginal delivery, since she was in trouble of circulation during her gestational period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to prevent catastrophe such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> elicited by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> related with labor pain, we performed continuous epidural anesthesia to control labor pain under the invasive blood pressure monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two epidural catheters were inserted into the epidural space via the L 2-3 and the L 5-S 1 intervertebral space, and mixed solutions containing both 0.125% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3215">bupivacaine</z:chebi> and 0.0002% fentanyl were administered continuously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 7 hours and 47 minutes from the start of her labor, she delivered her baby vaginally with the aid of forceps technique due to attenuated abdominal muscle activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No cardiovascular mishaps occurred during her labor and she was discharged 6 days after the delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, continuous epidural anesthesia with intensive monitoring of circulation may be useful for vaginal delivery in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> by avoiding cardiovascular complications due to labor pain </plain></SENT>
