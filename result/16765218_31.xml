<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We review our ongoing experience with a transabdominal stent repair of complex thoracoabdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (Crawford type I, II, and III) with surgical revascularization of visceral and renal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of prospectively collected data from 29 consecutive patients who underwent an attempted visceral hybrid procedure between January 2002 and April 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients were elective, four were urgent (symptomatic), and three were emergent (true rupture) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median patient age was 74 years (range, 37 to 81 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were Crawford type I in 3, type II in 18, type III in 7, and type IV in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Previous aortic surgery had been performed in 13 (45%) of 29 and included aortic valve and root replacement in 3, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="32497">TAA</z:chebi> repair in 1, type I repair in 1), type IV repair in 3, type B dissection in 2, infrarenal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 5, and right common iliac <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe preoperative comorbidity was present in 23 (80%) of 29: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> in 5, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> in 6, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial disease</z:e> in 11 at New York Heart Association grade II (6) and grade III (5), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> in 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients (90%) had a completed procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In two patients, myocardial instability prevented completion of the procedure despite extensive preoperative cardiac assessment, and in one, poor flow in the true lumen of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type B dissection prevented anastomosis of the revascularization grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Exclusion of the full thoracoabdominal aorta was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 26 completed procedures and extended to include the iliac arteries in four, with revascularization of coeliac in 26, superior mesenteric artery in 26, left renal artery in 21, and right renal artery in 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> &lt; or =30 days or during inpatient admission, and elective and urgent mortality was 13% (3/23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients with ruptured thoracoabdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> died &lt; or =30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Major complications included prolonged respiratory support (&gt;5 days) in 9, inotropic support in 4, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> requiring temporary support in 2 and not requiring support in 2, prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> in 2, resolved left hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 1, and resection of an ischemic left colon in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Median blood loss was 3.9 liters (range, 1.2 to 13 liters) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The median <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> time was 15 minutes (range, 13 to 27 minutes) for the superior mesenteric and coeliac arteries and 15 minutes for the renal arteries (range, 13 to 21 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The median hospital stay was 27 days (range, 16 to 84 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was a median of 8 months (range, 2 to 31 months), with 92 of 94 grafts patent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Six patients were found to have a type I endoleak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In four, this was a proximal leak, and stent extension in three reduced, but did not cure, the endoleak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>One patient with a distal type I endoleak was successfully treated by embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Four type II endoleaks resolved without intervention, and one was treated by occlusion coiling of the origin of the left subclavian artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>A single late type III endoleak was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early results of visceral hybrid stent-grafts for types I, II, and III thoracoabdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are encouraging, with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> in this particularly high-risk group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>These results have encouraged us to perform the new procedure, in preference to open surgery, in Crawford type I, II, and III thoracoabdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
