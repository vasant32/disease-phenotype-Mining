<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In 1977, the use of gelatine-resorcine-formaline (GRF) biological glue during surgery of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> was proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study retrospectively analyses the late results obtained with this adjunct in an experience extending over a 20-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1977 to July 1997, 193 patients (139 males and 54 females) aged from 15 to 79 years (mean age: 53 +/- 14 years) underwent an emergency operation for type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection and 162 (84%) were operated on within 48 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients (15.2%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients the ascending aorta was replaced and the aortic stumps were reinforced with the GRF glue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 43 patients (22.2%), the aortic valve was replaced either independently (5 cases-2.5%) or by means of a composite graft (35 cases-19.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recently three patients underwent a complete replacement of the ascending aorta and coronary reimplantation with preservation of the native aortic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because of the location of the intimal tear, the aortic replacement was extended to the transverse arch in 58 patients (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hospital mortality amounted to 21% (40 patients) (22.8% in patients with arch replacement and 20.3% in patients without arch replacement) (ns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The survivors were surveyed from 2 months to 20 years post-operatively (cumulative follow-up: 856 pt/years, mean follow-up: 85 +/- 66 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During this period of time, 23 patients (15%) had to be reoperated on for a total of 29 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Six of those patients (26%) died at reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At univariate analysis, presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05) and absence of arch replacement (P &lt; 0.02) were determinant risk factors for reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Emergency (P &lt; 0.01) and thoraco-abdominal replacement (P &lt; 0.04) were determinant risk-factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The actuarial freedom from reoperation (Kaplan-Meier, CI: 95%) was: 96.5% (90.9-98.2), 87.6% (79.8-92.7), 80.9% (70.8-88.1), 66.4% (51.1-78.9) at one, 5, 10 and 15 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A total of 36 patients (27.7%) died during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (P &lt; 0.01), reoperation (P &lt; 0.02), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.05), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.05) were determinant risk factors of late mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The actuarial late survival rate (Kaplan-Meier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CI: 95%), including hospital mortality, was: 71.5% (64.3-77.8), 66% (58.3-73), 56.4% (47.7-64.7), 46.3% (36.4-56.5) at one, 5, 10 and 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The GRF glue has proved to be extremely useful during initial emergency surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection, making the procedure much easier and safer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Through this operative improvement, the use of the GRF glue seems to have a beneficial influence on the late results which, however, depend mainly on the patient's basic condition </plain></SENT>
