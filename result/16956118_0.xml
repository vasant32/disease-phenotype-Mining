<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the results of 5-year experience with minimally invasive operation without medial incision and resection cartilages for correction of pectum excavatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From 2000 we made in our Hospital minimally invasive technique for the correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>75 patients were treated by minimally invasive technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A convex steel bar is inserted under the sternumtrough small bilateral Incisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The steel bar is inserted with the convexity facing posteriorly, and when it is in position, the bar is turned over </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 2 years the bar is removed when permanent remolding has occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Initial excelent results were maintained in 54 patients (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chest), good results in 16 (mild residual pectus) and poor in 5 (severe recurrence requiring further treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up since surgery were 3 months to 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Average blood loss was 25 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Average length of hospital stay was 8 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients returned to full activity after 2 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complications were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo> in 12 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> in 6 patients and displacement of the steel barr requiring revision in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Poor results occurred because steel bar was too soft in 3 patients, and soft sternum in 2 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The minimally invesive technique is effective without cartilage incision and resection or sternal osteotomy </plain></SENT>
