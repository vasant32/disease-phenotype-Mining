<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was combined with echocardiographic observations on aortic root diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aortic root diameter was measured in 91 of 186 patients (group A) and compared with that of 150 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects aged 3 weeks to 20 years (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients underwent serial measurement of the aortic root diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had serious cardiovascular sequelae that were related to the aorta (seven) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group A, aortic root diameters were at the upper limits of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>Dilatation</z:mpath> of the aortic root occurred in the eight patients before the development of life-threatening complications </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In children the aortic root diameter should be measured regularly (every 6 to 12 months) in as much as its rapid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> is predictive of those at risk of life-threatening sequelae </plain></SENT>
