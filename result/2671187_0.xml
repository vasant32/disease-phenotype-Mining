<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Case 1; The 31 year-old-woman was operated upon by Crawford's procedure, which includes reconstruction of renal arteries, superior mesenteric artery, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">celiac</z:e> artery using temporary shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although she had been well for three years after the operation before she developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, she could not tolerate the Bentall's procedure on it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case 2; The 37 year-old woman was operated upon for dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (DeBakey IIIb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The procedure included replacement of the descending and abdominal aorta by Dacron graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four years after the operation, enlargement of residual false lumen had been observed, which caused its dehiscence just proximal to the abdominal aortic anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Crawford's procedure, which includes reconstruction of renal arteries, superior mesenteric artery, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">celiac</z:e> artery using temporary shunt was employed for repair of the remaining thoracoabdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>She is well now 5 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that cardiovascular changes in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> must be observed carefully because of its high recurrent rate after initial surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The operation at proper time and a careful observation of cardiovascular changes will improve the prognosis </plain></SENT>
