<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> suffer mainly from the cardiovascular manifestations of the disease, in particular the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection or rupture of the dilated aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to improved diagnostic and early surgical intervention the life expectancy of these patients could be considerably improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, rupture is still the most frequent and dissection the second frequent cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Life threatening complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> and malperfusion syndrome, due to obstruction of aortic branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dissection of the ascending aorta is treated by implantation of a valved conduit with reimplantation of the coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some surgeons favor the complete replacement of the ascending aorta with preservation of the aortic valve, although long-term results show some development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> after this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the experience of the last years, most surgeons prefer the prophylactic replacement of the aorta in Marfan patients, i.e. before complications have occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A special treatment algorithm helps to define the indication for the operative treatment in different manifestations of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The low mortality of the elective replacement of the ascending aorta in contrast to replacement in emergency cases speaks in favor of the early operative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For the long-term prognosis of the patient a closed and continuous cardiologic surveillance is mandatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient should be close to a center with the necessary diagnostic tools and with sufficient experience with the medical and surgical treatment, in order to further improve the life expectancy in the future </plain></SENT>
