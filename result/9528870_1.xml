<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate the additional contributions to surgical planning of multiplanar reformatting, maximum intensity projections and three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECT AND METHODOLOGY: Fifty-three patients with newly diagnosed pathology of the thoracic aorta were scanned over a 15-month period; 25 scans were spiral acquisitions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scans were acquired during and following rapid injection of 100 ml of intravenous iopromide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reconstructed data was displayed as axial images, oblique or other multiplanar reformats and shaded surface display 3-D reconstructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two radiologists and two surgeons reviewed the images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The axial images were assessed initially, subsequently the reformats and 3-D reconstructed views were examined looking particularly for additional information that might add to the surgical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pathologies encountered were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (21 patients, including two with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>), saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (eight), fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (16), aortic root and ascending <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> (seven) and coarctation (one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relationship of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and dissections to major vessels are better shown with 3-D reconstruction or oblique reformats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>Morphology</z:mp> of saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, particularly the neck, is well shown with 3-D reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Coarctation was best demonstrated by oblique reformats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was little additional information from 3-D reconstruction or reformats in assessment of type A dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Improved spatial orientation by visualization in varying projections was helpful for surgical planning in certain cases of type B dissection, fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and aortic root and ascending <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Spiral acquisitions have the advantage of speed and hence a greater anatomical coverage for a single breath-hold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Oblique reformats and 3-D reconstruction, although using identical data as the axial images, in specific cases were felt to aid surgical assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and dissections, thus assisting pre-operative planning </plain></SENT>
