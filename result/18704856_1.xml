<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> and hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is the major concern in the surgical repair of descending and thoracoabdominal aortic pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For specific indications, the evolving technology of endovascular stent grafting is becoming increasingly popular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed our results for elective surgical repair of various aortic pathologies with respect to this innovative therapeutic background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From July 1993 to April 2006, 56 patients (mean age 55+/-16 years, range 25 to 80 years, 62.5% males) underwent elective surgical repair of the descending (n=37, 66.1%) and thoracoabdominal aorta (n=19, 33.9%), including seven reoperations and five cases of previous endovascular stent grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The underlying pathologies were: degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (n=21), type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (n=24), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type B dissection and an increase in the diameter of the descending aorta (n=11), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most patients were operated using deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality was 5.4 % (n=3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, one after coronary stent occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Another patient died due to ventricular disruption at the side of the left ventricular apical vent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> was 3.6% (n=2) with one case of complete and one of incomplete <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Survival at five years was 78% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: If modern surgical principles are used in elective descending and thoracoabdominal aortic repair, surgery can be performed with a low postoperative risk for hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results should be taken into account when evaluating alternative therapeutic strategies in patients with similar pathologies </plain></SENT>
