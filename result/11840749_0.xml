<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To discuss the surgical techniques and therapeutic effects of phacofragmentation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>dislocated lens</z:hpo> in the vitreous cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Phacofragmentation was performed on 23 eyes of 23 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001083'>dislocated lens</z:hpo> or subluxated lens in the vitreous cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With high suction and moderate ultrasound, the nucleus could be emulsified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Energy and time of emulsification: 50%-60% of energy was set up and emulsification spent 43 s to 3 min 23 s (mean 1 min 57 s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pressure of maximum vacuum <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> was 110-120 mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 11 eyes, anterior chamber intraocular lens (ACIOL) was implanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cryoapplications and encircling procedure were also performed on <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Phacofragmentation was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After follow-up for 5-19 months (mean 7.2 months), the corrected visual acuity was obviously improved in the cases of ACIOL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, with 12 patients achieving visual acuity of 0.12-0.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The major complications were corneal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and damage of iris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is demonstrated that phacofragmentation in the central vitreous cavity is safe and fairly easy procedure without adverse effects on retina and sclera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It helps to reduce intraoperative risks of alternative methods, avoiding a large opening of the anterior chamber and hypotony of the globe </plain></SENT>
