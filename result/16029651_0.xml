<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the safety and feasibility of endograft repair in refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical data of 13 refractory cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, 11 males and 2 females, aged 52 (38-82), out of the 68 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> who underwent endograft repair from Jan 2001 to Oct 2004, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine of the 13 cases were diagnoses as with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of Stanford type A, 3 of which had tears in the ascending aorta (DeBakey type I), 3 had tears in aortic arch, and 3 had tears on the distal aortic arch with ascending aorta involved; and the other four out of the 13 cases were diagnosed as Stanford type B, one with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 13 cases had more than 2 entries, 3 of which had suffered from shock and hemathorax due to rupture preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up ranging 2 months to 3 years was carried out after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transluminal placement of stentgratf was technically successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients with DeBakey type I dissections received stent-grafts introduced through the left common carotid or right femoral artery, of which one case died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal hemorrhage</z:hpo> 1 month postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the patients with tears in aortic arch preliminary Y type bypass from ascending aorta to left common carotid artery and left subclivian artery was performed in 2 cases, and carotid-carotid artery bypass was performed in one case, and then stent-grafts were deployed through right femoral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 3 cases with tears in the distal arch and ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, received stent-grafts implantation through the femoral artery emergently, and closed thoracic drainage and anti-shock treatment, one of which died from another <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture 27 hours postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Out of the 4 cases with Stanford type B dissection with multiple tear entries, 3 underwent multiple stent-grafts repair and 1 underwent emergent abdominal-bilateral iliac arteries Y-type graft bypass due to rupture of iliac dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up CT, MRI and color Doppler sonography showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 11 patients remained healthy with the former tears well closed and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the false lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endograft repair for refractory aortic dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is feasible and technically successful, especially for the patients with tears in the ascending aorta or aortic arch </plain></SENT>
