<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> have cardiovascular manifestations and complications of these abnormalities lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 50% of patients by the age of 32 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report is concerned with the performance of 79 operations to control these problems in 41 patients during a 16-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 3 early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and 11 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, with survival at 15 years in 62% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cardiovascular manifestations assumed eight patterns of involvement, in brief, consisting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of ascending aorta, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral valve insufficiency</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002622'>dissecting aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>, and degenerative distal fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These lesions occurred in isolated form or in association with others, hence the larger number of patterns of involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Various methods were employed in treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta, which was associated with aortic valvular insufficiency in most </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most reliable method of controlling disease at this level was composite valve graft replacement of fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and separate valve graft operation for dissections occurring in the previously uninvolved aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral valve insufficiency</z:hpo> was relieved by standard mitral valve replacement and this operation could be safely combined with composite valve graft replacement of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More distant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the aorta, either degenerative or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissections, were susceptible to reconstruction as employed in the nonMarfan patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment of multiple lesions was staged, treating the more symptomatic condition first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Regular follow-up examination is important in these patients to detect new lesions and to evaluate known lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An aggressive approach is suggested in their treatment because 63% of the 11 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in this series were due to lesions that could be successfully treated by presently available methods </plain></SENT>
