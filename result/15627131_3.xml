<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histological, histochemical and electron microscopy research methods were employed with an assay of the results obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that in connective tissue <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in the aorta, the histological structure of the intima undergoes substantial changes alongside the pathology of the tunica media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is marked by the formation of a focal and diffuse thickening with the predominance of the interstitial substance, rich in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycans</z:chebi>, and of a small amount of fibrous structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The morphological signs of the impairment of endothelial permeability (vacuolisation of cytoplasm, thinning of its peripheral portions and basal membrane, expansion of intercellular fissures) are identifiabe, which leads to the disorder of aortic wall metabolism and early development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The changes in the intima together with the pathology of the tunica media ere predisposing factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation, dissection and rupture of the aorta </plain></SENT>
