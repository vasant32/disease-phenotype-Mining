<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: A majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> affect the ascending aorta and are <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> in nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> dissections in this region are uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report characterises the clinicopathological features of 15 non-iatrogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004933'>ascending aortic dissections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 65 patients who had surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004933'>ascending aortic dissection</z:hpo> over a period of 6 years, 15 showed morphological evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical data and morphological features of these were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients (80%) were over the age of 50 years, with a male predominance (11 patients, 73.33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exertional dyspnoea was the most common presenting symptom, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> was noted in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An echocardiographic diagnosis of dissection was made in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The disease was restricted to the ascending aorta in nine (60%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> of varying severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Areas of recent dissection were also noted in three specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The risk factors or pathogenetic mechanisms noted were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in four and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, penetrating atherosclerotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001643'>patent ductus arteriosus</z:hpo>, and vehicular accident, in one patient each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The aortic segment of the latter patient had shown intimal flaps to be associated with multiple saucer-shaped <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depressions</z:hpo> with thin walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These features were also noted in two of the seven patients without risk factors and in two hypertensives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This raises the possibility of subclinical intimal injury sustained during sudden deceleration with blunt chest trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Significant aortopathy was seen in 10 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> dissections as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> and aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, especially in the elderly, should be kept in mind </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This may follow sudden deceleration intimal injuries, superimposed on aged-related medial degeneration </plain></SENT>
