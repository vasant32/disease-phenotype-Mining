<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Undifferentiated CT <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (CTD) was established in 110 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had differentiated CTD (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A modified schedule including 63 indices was used to study the external phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The external signs of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases of echocardiographically verified CTD with a predominance of the manifestations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001999'>craniofacial dysmorphism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maximum number of external CTD was ascertained in patients with differentiated CTD and in those with undifferentiated CTD who had an asthenic constitution and <z:mp ids='MP_0001259'>abnormal body weight</z:mp> deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of external markers, which exceeds the threshold level (5), or the presence of 3-4 morphodysplasias at various sites is considered to be diagnostically significant in detecting minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac anomalies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The paper presents an algorithm for diagnosing cardiac microanomalies, which is based on the determination of the external signs of CTD </plain></SENT>
