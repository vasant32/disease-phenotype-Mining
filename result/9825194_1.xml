<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the specific anatomical, clinical, and prognostic profiles of aortic pathology are less well characterized in the setting of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> symptomatic from aortic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: The study was designed to characterize the spectrum of anatomical, clinical, and prognostic profiles of thoracic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> in symptomatic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> compared with patients with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Noninvasive imaging techniques were used for comprehensive mapping of aortic pathology associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-five consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (16 women, 19 men; mean age 35 +/- 12 years) were imaged by transthoracic (TTE; n = 26) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE; n = 11), contrast enhanced computed tomography (XCT; n = 16), or magnetic resonance techniques (MRI; n = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic results were compared with both intraoperative or angiographic findings and also with a group of 85 consecutive patients with aortic pathology associated with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Aortic pathology was more frequently confined to the ascending aorta (p &lt; 0.05) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> was more prevalent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> than in arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 23 cases (66%) of dissection and 12 cases (34%) of nondissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, no Marfan-specific aortic macropathology was identified when compared with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic results of TEE, XCT, and MRI were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> excellent; however, in contrast to the transesophageal ultrasound approach, transthoracic ultrasound was not useful in the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both 30-day (100 vs. 70%; p &lt; 0.05) and 5-year survival rates (91 vs. 57%; NS) were higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> than in those with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Repeat surgery, however, was more frequently required in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (25% vs. none in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are no macropathologic findings of the aorta specific for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> with an inherently high rate of aortic complications, serial noninvasive imaging should be encouraged, preferably utilizing TEE or MRI </plain></SENT>
