<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The concept was promoted that these changes are nonspecific and caused by general hemodynamic events within the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this investigation the aortic media was studied in patients with a dilated ascending aorta, whose hemodynamic profile is known to be altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with data obtained from the study of aortas with complete or incomplete dissection and aortas from patients with Marfan's syndrome, a condition known to predispose to dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only quantitative differences were found between the normal "aging" aorta and the overtly abnormal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of dissected <z:disease ids="001122">aneurysm</z:disease>, therefore, is considered to be initiated by processes if injury and repair within the aortic wall, consequent to hemodynamic forces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The histologic features of the media previously implicated as the specific underlying defect appear to represent the morphologic substrate of this traumatizing and reparative process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This process may gradually lead to dilatation of the aorta and, according to Laplace's law, a vicious cycle may ensue that may lead to further complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Local circumstances determine whether a dilated aorta will rupture or whether an incomplete or complete dissection will occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The fact that the aorta in patients with Marfan's syndrome shows basically the same structural alterations supports the concept proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The underlying connective tissue disorder in these patients will lead to complications at an earlier age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Dissecting <z:disease ids="001122">aneurysm</z:disease> therefore is part of a spectrum of lesions that have as a common denominator the process of injury and repair </plain></SENT>
