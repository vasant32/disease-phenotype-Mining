<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta or aortic root frequently have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortic leaflets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aortic valve dysfunction is caused by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the sinotubular junction, distortion or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the sinuses of Valsalva, annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath>, or a combination of these problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the case of annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath>, reconstruction of the aortic root is performed by reimplanting the aortic valve in a tubular Dacron graft (reimplantation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the case of mild or no annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath>, reconstruction of the aortic root is performed by correcting the <z:mp ids='MP_0011574'>dilated sinotubular junction</z:mp> and replacement of the aortic sinuses if they are also dilated with an appropriately tailored Dacron graft (remodeling) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From July 1989 to March 1994, 45 patients have had either reimplantation of the aortic valve (19 patients) or remodeling of the aortic root (26 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, 11 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and five had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, and nine also had transverse arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were two operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, both in the remodeling group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient who had reimplantation needed composite replacement of the aortic valve and ascending aorta because of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> after the repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A young patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> had progressive aortic valve dysfunction during a growth spurt and had aortic valve replacement 2 years after the initial operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No other valve-related complication has occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The remaining 41 patients have only mild or no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo>, and the repair remains stable from 1 to 58 months, mean 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These two types of aortic valve reconstruction have provided excellent clinical results in carefully selected adult patients </plain></SENT>
