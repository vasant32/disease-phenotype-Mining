<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the last 21 years, 100 patients with type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> underwent 102 operations including 2 reoperations, and 29 patients showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During operation, no cerebral perfusion technique was used through February 1985 (period I), antegrade cerebral perfusion was applied since March 1985 (period II), and retrograde cerebral perfusion was introduced in November 1990 (period III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgical results were compared among these subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality was 12.1% in 33 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and 57.1% in 7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> patients in period I, 11.1% in 27 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and 54.5% in 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> patients in period II, and 6.7% in 15 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and 0% in 9 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> patients in period III (period II versus III; p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Retrograde cerebral perfusion decreased permanent brain complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-year actuarial survival was 59.7% in period I and 63.2% in period II (not significant), and the 3-year survival of period III was 91.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival of period III was significantly higher than those of periods I and II (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgical repair of aortic arch with cerebral perfusion techniques reduced the residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results show that surgical results of type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in this series improved with the introduction of retrograde cerebral perfusion and extended surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
