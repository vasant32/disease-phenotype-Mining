<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> is an inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> that affects many organ systems and has widespread phenotype expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis is therefore made by phenotype assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>Dural ectasia</z:hpo> has been classified as a major diagnostic criterium with a prevalence of over 90% in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study determine the feasibility of performing CT angiographic examination of aorta and large vessels for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> grading in a single CT exam of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 7 examinations in Marfan patients were performed of which 6 were CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> exams the aorta was evaluated and simultaneously the lumbosacral region of the spine was well delineated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We performed calculation of spinal canal (SCI) and dural sac (DSI) indices and also qualitative grading of dural sac involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 4 patients both SCI (&gt; 4,50) and DSI (&gt; 3,75) fulfil the diagnostic criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spondyloptosis</z:e> was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Whole body CT examination is the perfect tool for both aorta and spinal canal evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite differences in spinal canal grading methods in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of our patients significant changes of the spinal canal in the lumbosacral region were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>Dural ectasia</z:hpo> is easy to detect and quantify and may therefore be used as a sensitive and specific sign of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
