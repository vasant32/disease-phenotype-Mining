<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three patients whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003504" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ai">aortic incompetence</z:e> (A.I.) was recognized in childhood, have had an angiographic study 10, 9 and 4 years, respectively, following the first clinical diagnosis of their valvular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A.I. was related, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases, to a dysplastic valve ("<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026267" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PMV">floppy valve syndrome</z:e>"); in none of them was there an abnormal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our opinion, the absence of an abnormal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> separates our cases from those in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> is part of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, either in its full form or in the "forme fruste" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From the clinical viewpoint, the presence of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ascending aorta could explain the mild course of these cases, as compared to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the attempt to differentiate the two types of dysplastic valvular disease from an etiologic viewpoint, we suggest that the basic problem in our patients could be an alteration of the valvular connective tissue development, rather than a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e>, like the one possibly responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
