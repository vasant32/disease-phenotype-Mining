<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>Dilatation</z:mpath> of the aortic root is the hallmark feature in the cardiovascular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>Aortic dilatation</z:hpo> is associated with fragmented elastic fibers and accumulation of amorphous matrix elements in the medial layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This pathology is caused by mutations in fibrillin 1, the major structural component of elastic microfibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fibrillin 1 mutations may affect the assembly or function of the elastic microfibrils or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To answer this important question, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>-like mice have been created </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>-like mice were generated by homologous gene targeting in embryonic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Targeting of the mouse fibrillin 1 gene had the dual effect of reducing gene expression 10-fold and of producing an internally deleted protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mutant homozygous mice make very small amounts of only mutant fibrillin 1 and die postnatally of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e>-like vascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histopathological findings include focal fragmentation of elastic fibers and accumulation of amorphous matrix in the aortic media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A mouse model for the severe form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> has been created using the technique of gene targeting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Aside from its clinical value, the model has demonstrated that fibrillin 1 is predominantly involved in the function rather than the assembly of elastic microfibrils </plain></SENT>
