<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the substernal strut was fashioned from a Dacron vascular graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was done by telephone (most cases) and also by office visit (43 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period was 12 months to 21.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred thirty-three patients (83%) had satisfactory chest contour; 17 had a fair result, and 11 had frank recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for poor contour were an asymmetrical defect, a severe defect, and associated congenital anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One hundred thirty (81%) had a satisfactory scar, and 31 had hypertrophic scars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for hypertrophic scar formation were increasing age and weight, and tripod internal fixation used early in the series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Factors not contributing to clinical outcome include the sex of the patient, positive family history, perioperative complications, year of surgery, surgeon, and type of incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of a Dacron strut is relatively easy and complication-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It can be left permanently in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Long-term results have been good, except in patients with an extensive or asymmetrical deformity, and in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0158795" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">other congenital anomalies</z:e>, especially <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
