<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-seven percent had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection and 33% had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type A dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to repair or replacement of the ascending aorta, 121 patients (48%) required an aortic valve procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Valve resuspension was performed in 46 (39 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A and 7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type A), with an operative mortality rate of 13% +/- 5% (+/- 70% confidence limits), and aortic valve replacement in 75 (36 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A and 39 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> type A), with an operative mortality rate of 20% +/- 5% (p = not significant versus resuspension) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The operative mortality rate for patients requiring only repair or replacement of the ascending aorta was 32% +/- 4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indications for valve replacement included coexistent (nonacute) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath>, and cases in which successful resuspension could not be accomplished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall actuarial survival rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 59% +/- 3% (+/- 1 standard error of the mean), 40% +/- 4%, and 25% +/- 5% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival rates at these same times for patients with valve resuspension were 67% +/- 8%, 52% +/- 10%, and 26% +/- 19%, respectively; for patients who required aortic valve replacement, these survival rates were 70% +/- 5%, 39% +/- 8%, and 21% +/- 11%; finally, patients who received only an ascending aortic procedure had survival probabilities of 51% +/- 5%, 37% +/- 6%, and 23% +/- 6% (p = not significant versus resuspension versus aortic valve replacement) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed advanced age (p less than 0.001), previous cardiac or aortic operation (p less than 0.001), more preoperative dissection complications (p = 0.002), and earlier operative date (p = 0.038) to be the only significant, independent factors that increased the likelihood of early or late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The type of aortic valve procedure (resuspension versus aortic valve replacement versus none) was not a significant predictor of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two of 46 patients with valve resuspension required late aortic valve replacement (freedom from aortic valve replacement: 100% and 80% +/- 13% at 5 and 10 years, respectively), as did 4 of 75 patients with initial aortic valve replacement (freedom from repeat aortic valve replacement: 98% +/- 2% and 73% +/- 13%, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
