<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These histological changes are not specific for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, the relation with which is very inconstant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incomplete replacement of the affected tissues risks a recurrence which is especially serious when the sinus of Valsalva is involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, total replacement of the ascending aorta with aortic valve replacement and reimplantation of the coronary arteries is generally indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histology of the excised tissues should be performed routinely with specific stains for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37395">mucopolysaccharides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Close follow-up of operated patients with this condition is recommended, especially those with only partial replacements </plain></SENT>
