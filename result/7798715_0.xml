<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 36-year-old woman developed a DeBakey type-I <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> in October 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We replaced the ascending aorta and resuspended the aortic valve urgently, when she had not been diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In August 1989, we replaced the distal portion of the descending aorta and the infra-renal abdominal aorta because of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> in the diameter of these regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In September 1990, she had sudden severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography and Doppler ultrasonography revealed that a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> developed in the aortic arch and the descending aorta (three-channeled dissection) and that the new false lumen compressed the true and the old false lumens obstructing the blood flow to the abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>She was immediately placed an axilo-femoral bypass, and in January 1991 she underwent the arch and descending aorta replacement using permanent bypass to the supra-aortic branches and partial extracorporeal circulation (first reported by Larmi et al) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative course was satisfactory, and she has been well at 3 years after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because progressive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of an untreated dissecting aorta is common in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, aggressive replacement of the diseased aorta is indicated in these patients </plain></SENT>
