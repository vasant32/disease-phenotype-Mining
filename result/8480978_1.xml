<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nine cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> were identified between 1975 and 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven of these fell within the context of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, while the other 2 were idiopathic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aortic leak was found to be massive from the outset in 5 cases and progressively worsened in 2 other cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 138 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients were treated surgically, with nil mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three corrective procedures were used: aortic valve replacement only or in combination with an additional procedure concerning the aorta (3 cases), or composite graft using the Bentall technique as modified by Cabrol (2 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 2 late complications among the incomplete procedures (detachment of the valve graft, recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 4 patients who did not undergo surgery <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> died: twice of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and as a result of myocardial dysfunction in the other 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results confirm the potentially grave course of this condition and emphasise the usefulness of routine surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mastery of surgical techniques now justifies the extension of the indications of prophylactic surgery to any <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> having reached 6 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Bentall technique modified by Cabrol remains the treatment of choice </plain></SENT>
