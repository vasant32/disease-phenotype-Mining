<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Aim of this paper is to describe and discuss, on the basis of an exhaustive review of literature, the case of a 14-year-old girl with familiar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This disease is a generalized inherited disorder with involvement of connective tissue and symptoms affecting ocular, skeletal and cardio-vascular systems, usually diagnosed in young age and associated with a poor prognosis because of late severe aortic complications (dissection, dilation or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, regurgitation, etc.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The young patient sought to our medical attention because of severe leanness, delayed menarca and irregular menstruations; physical examination disclosed the typical "morphotype of Marfan" with <z:mp ids='MP_0000548'>long limbs</z:mp>, slenderness of hands and feet, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002751'>kyphoscoliosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000774'>narrow chest</z:hpo> with "<z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo>", marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001382'>hyperextensible joints</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000156'>high arched palate</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000689'>malocclusion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography demonstrated a mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 43-year-old patient's mother presented an undiagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, despite typical morphotype, muscle-skeletal alterations and moderate dilation of ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maternal grand-mother deceased prematurely for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopathy</z:e> of unknown origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is stressed that the disease should not be underestimated, because the early diagnosis is important for the patient's prognosis, allowing the early preventive surgical intervention for correcting aortic or valvular alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The echocardiography represents a sensitive and noninvasive mean, useful to manage the patients with proven or suspected <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> who exhibit <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0010574'>aortic dilation</z:mp>, or an aortic diameter in excess of 50 mm, should be considered for an elective surgical intervention (at low mortality and suitable to increase remarkably the lifetime expectation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Women with syndrome of Marfan should be advised on the high cardio-vascular risk during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
