<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: a) To determine if antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is elevated in patients undergoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>spinal fusion</z:hpo>, especially in those who have clinical evidence of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIADH</z:e>); b) to evaluate the relationship between ADH secretion and the secretion of atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (ANP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary care pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) in a university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A prospective cross-sectional, observational study with factorial design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Thirty patients &gt; or = 10 yrs of age undergoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>spinal fusion</z:hpo> admitted to the ICU for postoperative care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Patients underwent anterior, posterior, or both anterior/posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>spinal fusion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood was collected for serial measurements of ADH, ANP and serum electrolyte levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Heart rate, blood pressure and central venous pressure were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirty children were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nineteen had idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, nine had neuromuscular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, one had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's disease</z:e>, and one had congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten (33%) children met clinical criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIADH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in duration of surgery, blood loss, volume of iv fluid administration pre- and intraoperatively, or type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> between those who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIADH</z:e> and those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic variables were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ADH levels increased in both groups immediately postoperatively and at 6 hrs after surgery, but were much more elevated in those patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIADH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIADH</z:e> also had significantly higher ADH levels preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In relation to serum osmolality, ADH was considerably higher in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIADH</z:e> compared with those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although ANP values tended to be higher in the group with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIADH</z:e>, this did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIADH</z:e> occurs in a subset of children who undergo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>spinal fusion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIADH</z:e> can be made easily using clinical parameters which are well-defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In the face of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIADH</z:e>, continued volume expansion may be harmful, and should therefore be avoided </plain></SENT>
