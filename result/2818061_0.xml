<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To minimize cross-clamp time and reduce the incidence of such complications, we have used an intraluminal ring graft to reestablish aortic continuity in patients with descending thoracic aortic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From March 1978 to December 1986, we used this technique alone in 28 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 4 patients with traumatic aortic disruptions, 4 with dissections, 4 with expanding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 2 with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 1 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, and 13 with atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> that were repaired electively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cross-clamp times ranged from 4 to 28 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were three early postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (within 30 days) and one late postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the follow-up period (mean, 28.2 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ring dislodgement occurred only once, in the first patient in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no instances of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the use of an intraluminal ring graft greatly reduces the aortic cross-clamp time and is a safe and effective technique </plain></SENT>
