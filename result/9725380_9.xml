<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We compared five current minimal-access approaches, namely, parasternal incision, transverse sternotomy, manubrial inverted "T" incision, incomplete mediastinotomy, and our "J/j" incision, to operations in matched patients, including aortic operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a case-control study of 74 patients, 37 individuals consecutively underwent minimal-access operations (aortic valve, 18, including one mitral valve operation; composite valve graft, six, including one arch and one transaortic mitral valve operation for a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>; ascending aorta operation, two; root repair/reconstruction, three; mitral valve repair/replacement, seven, including one maze operation; and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018817" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="ASD|asd">atrioseptal defect</z:e> repair, one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were matched by sex, age, surgeon, and operation with 37 control patients who had standard incisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients having the "J/j" incision (n=25) had sternotomies from the first right intercostal space, or sternal notch, to the third to fifth right intercostal space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Minimal-access patients had a shorter postoperative hospital stay than standard incision patients (6.2 versus 8.2 days; p=0.0055), and required similar volumes of blood (0.86 versus 1.03 units; p=0.7243), postoperative <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> dosages (28 mg versus 40 mg, p=0.0643), and oral narcotics (8.1 versus 10.0 doses; p=0.3562). "J/j" incision patients, however, required less <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> (20.6 mg versus 40.9 mg; p=0.0028), but not fewer doses of oral narcotics (7.5 versus 9.9 doses; p=0.2640) and had the shortest postoperative stay (5.1 versus 8.1 days; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or clinically noted neurocognitive deficit developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One minimal-access patient (1/37, 2.7%) with severe preoperative pulmonary morbidity died of adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sternal nonunion developed in 1 patient with an inverted "T" manubrial incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a further seven patients, the "J/j" incision was used without a problem, for a total of 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This compared with a consecutive series of 125 aortic valve replacement operations without a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and 181 patients undergoing ascending arch operations with two 30-day hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (1.1%) and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (1.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Minimal-access incisions are associated with shorter hospital stays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For the "J/j" incision, even if used for more extensive double-valve, ascending aortic arch, or composite valve operations, postoperative pain appears to be less and patients are discharged even earlier </plain></SENT>
