<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal abnormalities</z:hpo>, reported recently to accompany the syndrome, may serve as an easily identifiable clinical indicator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of these abnormalities was defined in 24 patients with proved <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> of the mitral valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The valvular syndrome was defined clinically, by echocardiography and, in seven cases, by left ventricular angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The skeletal deformities were defined clinically and radiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>Pectus excavatum</z:hpo> was present in 62 percent of the patients, "straight back" in 17 percent and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> in 8 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of the 24 patients (75 percent) had a definite thoracic skeletal deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association of idiopathic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> of the mitral valve with these skeletal deformities may represent a forme fruste of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with "straight back" and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> should be examined clinically and perhaps by echocardiography to exclude idiopathic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> of the mitral valve; when murmurs are present, a diagnosis of "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543946" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">pseudoheart disease</z:e>" should not be made before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> has been excluded </plain></SENT>
