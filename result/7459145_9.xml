<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Four hundred and ninety-nine surgically excised valves were examined for pathological evidence of myxomatous degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six valves (7%) had myxomatous degeneration as a major pathological finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen valves (3%) had significant myxomatous degeneration of the pars fibrosa, a finding which we define as "primary myxomatous degeneration" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic findings and catheterisation results were correlated with the clinical course, surgical results, and follow-up in these 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiograms in 10 of the 11 patients who had them (91%) showed abnormalities suggesting the presence of primary myxomatous degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography was more helpful than angiography in diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The histological pattern of primary mitral myxomatous degeneration appears to be identical to that seen in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> and five of six patients with mitral lesions had echocardiographic evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with primary myxomatous degeneration of the aortic valve had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While the aetiology of primary myxomatous degeneration of cardiac valves is not known, a link to a more generalised disorder is suggested </plain></SENT>
