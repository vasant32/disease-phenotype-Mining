<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although often asymptomatic, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> (PAD) is associated with significant morbidity in a large proportion of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is the underlying pathology in many instances, involving the whole arterial tree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whole-body magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) permits rapid, non-invasive and accurate evaluation of the entire vascular system and can be used for both diagnostic purposes and monitoring of vascular involvement in diseases such as <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRA has been used successfully in the identification of high-grade stenosis in PAD, abnormalities of the ileocaval veins and carotid plaque imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Carotid disease</z:e> is significantly correlated with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and renal artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic lesions in one vascular bed are often related to additional asymptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> in other vascular regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRA may be advantageous over computed tomographic angiography because it can be performed with contrast media virtually devoid of serious toxicity and without utilization of ionizing radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Display of the entire arterial vasculature can be achieved in &lt;90 s, with excellent sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recent technological advances, such as parallel imaging and the implementation of dedicated matrix coils, have further increased image quality, and in combination with the blood-pool contrast agents, such as gadofosveset trisodium (Vasovist, Bayer Schering Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany), extended imaging time, higher spatial resolution and larger anatomical coverage can be achieved </plain></SENT>
