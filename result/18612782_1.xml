<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000766'>Pectus deformities</z:hpo> and cardiac problems sometimes require simultaneous surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our experience of performing this surgery and review the relevant literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed simultaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000766'>pectus deformity</z:hpo> correction and open-heart surgery in six patients between 1999 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000766'>pectus deformities</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000768'>pectus carinatum</z:hpo> in one patient and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000767'>pectus excavatum</z:hpo> in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cardiac problems were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> in one patient, an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018817" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="ASD|asd">atrioseptal defect</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>) with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010402'>VSD</z:mp>) in one, a <z:mp ids='MP_0010402'>VSD</z:mp> in one, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral valve insufficiency</z:hpo> with left atrial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> in one, and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> with <z:mp ids='MP_0006047'>aortic valve insufficiency</z:mp> caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We corrected the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000766'>pectus deformities</z:hpo> using the modified Ravitch's sternoplasty in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>First, while the patient was supine, we resected the costal cartilage; then, after completing the cardiac surgery, the sternum was closed and the additional time required for the pectus operation was calculated for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were examined 1, 4, and 6 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average operation time was 102 min, and there were no major complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pectus bars were removed 4-6 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Good cardiac and cosmetic results were achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, who were followed up for 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000766'>pectus deformity</z:hpo> correction and open-heart surgery can be performed safely, eliminating the risks of a second operation in a staged procedure </plain></SENT>
