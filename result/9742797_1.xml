<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>19 patients who underwent consecutive aortic root reconstruction between 1985 May to 1998 February were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up period was 5.1 +/- 3.2 years and longest follow-up term was 12.5 years </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were found in four patients who <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> belonged to group D, respectively caused by; rupture of thoracoabdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> after subsequent thoracoabdominal surgery, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> due to prosthetic valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Considering high incidence of late <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of residual aorta, simultaneous total arch replacement with aortic root reconstruction is recommended in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
