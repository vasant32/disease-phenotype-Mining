<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the surgical indications, operative results, and need for reoperation in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1980 to 1996, 245 patients underwent cardiac operations for complications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>; 26 (11%) were less than 18 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age at the time of operation was 10.3 +/- 1 years (range, 8 months to 17 years); 18 of the patients were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indications for operation were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> (15 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (4 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (6 patients), and aortic arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Operations included aortic root replacement (15 patients), aortic root replacement and mitral repair (5 patients), aortic root replacement and mitral replacement (1 patient), mitral repair (3 patients), mitral replacement (1 patient), and arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> repair (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean aortic root diameter in patients undergoing aortic root replacement was 6.2 +/- 0.2 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 1 patient underwent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004933'>ascending aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At a mean follow-up of 67.1 +/- 10.2 months, 8 patients required a second cardiac procedure (41% +/- 17% 10-year freedom from reoperation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Indications for further operations were distal aortic pathology (3 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> after initial mitral operation (3 patients), failed mitral repair (1 patient), and homograft degeneration (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for a second cardiac procedure were age less than 10 years at the time of the first operation (p &lt; 0.003) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall, 25 (96%) of 26 patients have undergone aortic root replacement and 11 (42%) patients have undergone a mitral procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There have been 4 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of presumed cardiac origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The 10-year survival rate is 79% +/- 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> surviving patients are in New York Heart Association functional class I or II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> is the most common surgical indication in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, (2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> is the second most common indication, (3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> is unusual in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, and (4) careful follow-up is necessary, particularly in younger children, because more than half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> require repeated cardiac operations within 10 years </plain></SENT>
