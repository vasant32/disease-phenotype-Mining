<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between December 1972 and January 2009 60 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> were operated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were subjected to ascending aorta and aortic valve replacement with valve containing conduit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five of 60 patients (8.3%) were subjected to 7 repeat operations (2 patients were reoperated twice) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Causes of repeat interventions were: conduit dysfunction (n=3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (n=3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients died: 2 during surgery because of impaired conduit function, one - in 1 year after repeat operation of mitral valve replacement for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> with pronounced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As an example a case of a female patient who had been subjected to repetitive surgeries because of malfunctioning conduit is presented in this paper </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Main reason for reoperations was the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Progression of this disease might continue after operation, alteration of the aortic wall promote dissection in regions not subjected to prosthetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Application of prostheses especially designed for replacement of the ascending aorta excludes such causes of reoperations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as disruption of old sutured of two parts conduits </plain></SENT>
