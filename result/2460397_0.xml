<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On microscopic examination, myxomatous degeneration was observed in 14 cases, postinflammatory changes, however, were seen in the other 19 cases and included diffuse vascularization with thick-walled vessels, round-cell infiltration and destruction of valve architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These valves showed a varying degree of doming and/or interchordal hooding as well as an increased surface area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elongated chordae tendineae were seen in 37%, chordal rupture in 16% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Slightly fused chordae tendineae, minimal commissural fusion and/or fibrous thickening of cusps were also observed, findings which simulate closely <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264757" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic valvulitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
