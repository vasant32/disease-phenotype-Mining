<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> remains controversial because of the underlying degenerative process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From October 1986 to June 1996, 33 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> underwent a mitral valve procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 30 years (range, 2 to 55 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>Mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> was caused by annulus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> in 2 patients, leaflet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> in 30 patients, and restricted leaflet motion in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mitral valve repair was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients except 1 who had mitral valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two patients died in the perioperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> survivors were available for follow-up, which ranged from 1 month to 122 months (mean follow-up, 39 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were three late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, two of which were related to aortic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival rate was 78.9% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Freedom from mitral valve reoperation was 87.1% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic studies were obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> survivors and showed absent or mild (1+) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> in 21 patients and moderate (2+) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mitral valve repair for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> can be performed safely in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This technique provided stable midterm results comparable with those obtained for other degenerative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264765,C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
