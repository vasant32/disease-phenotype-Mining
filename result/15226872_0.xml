<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This group included 14 patients with dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (ten and four respectively, belonging to Types I and II), and 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (six atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and four annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hospital mortality was 35.7% (5/14) in the dissection subgroups and 16.6% (2/12) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> subgroup (difference NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No operative risk factor was recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 19 survivors have been followed up for a total of 393 patient-months (range 5 to 49 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Controls included echocardiography and computed tomography scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients died because of rupture of a persistently dissected aorta; another patient died of an unknown cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total actuarial survival rate at 4 years was 58.3 +/- 10.4% (83.3 +/- 10.7% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and 42.3 +/- 13.4% for dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among late survivors, there were no paravalvular leaks, new dissections, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolisms</z:hpo>, although two perigraft <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> and a persistent dissection were later disclosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When appropriate, composite conduit replacement of the ascending aorta can increase the survival rate, and can also be useful in high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
