<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous operation was successfully performed by aortic valve composite graft insertion and sternal turnover with the rectus muscle pedicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following a midline skin incision, the cost-sterno complex (plastron) was dissected together with the bilateral rectus muscle pedicles, and the sternum was divided transversely through the second intercostal space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The plastron with muscle pedicles was retracted away from the anterior chest toward the abdomen and was covered by the moistened sternal bag made of <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53226,53227">polyethylene</z:chebi> to prevent dryness and contamination during the composite graft insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aortic root was replaced with a composite graft consisting of a 25 mm SJM valve and a 26 mm Hemashield graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A short interposed 10 mm Hemashield graft was inserted between the ostia of the left coronary artery and the composite graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The right coronary artery was reimplanted in the aortic conduit using the button technique with a doughnut pledget </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This one stage method offered excellent operative exposure and enabled us to prevent possible <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of the sternum, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of the mediastinal sinus, and postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> resulting from chest wall compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this procedure, active usage of the rapid autologous transfusion system effectively reduced the total amount of blood transfusion </plain></SENT>
