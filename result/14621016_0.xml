<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was a 51-year-old woman with a 70 mm Stanford type B <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median sternotomy and replacement of the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta were performed under deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, the patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, after immediate placement of an intrathecal catheter and drainage of cerebrospinal fluid for 72 hours, the neurologic deficit fully resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite concerns related to the complexity of the procedure and neurological protection during the procedure, we believe that single-stage replacement of the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta is possible and is one of several surgical choices for patients such as ours </plain></SENT>
