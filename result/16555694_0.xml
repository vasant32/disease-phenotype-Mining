<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the management protocol proposed in France for this condition in order to establish recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A questionnaire was sent to cardiologists, paediatric cardiologists and cardiac surgeons and also to patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of the 228 physicians who replied prohibited violent sporting activities and less than a quarter advised against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a wide dispersion in the prescription of beta blockers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> as 57% proposed this treatment only in cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the aorta and 5% prescribed no treatment at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, beta blockers were widely prescribed (93%) after replacement of the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When poorly tolerated in adults, the most commonly prescribed option was a calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (60%) followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi> and therapeutic abstention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, 60% of paediatric cardiologists preferred to withdraw treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results were confirmed by the replies from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>: 58.3% were prescribed beta blockers with a higher proportion in children less than 12 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This treatment was introduced late, about 7 years after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that there is much disparity in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> whether or not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, especially with regards the prescription of beta blockers, justifying the publication of recommendations </plain></SENT>
