<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We report our 6-year experience with the visceral hybrid procedure for high-risk patients with thoracoabdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> (TAAA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> expanding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> (CEAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Hybrid procedure includes debranching of the visceral and renal arteries followed by endovascular exclusion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A series of 28 patients (20 male, mean age 66 years) were treated between January 2001 and July 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients had TAAAs type I-III, one type IV, four thoracoabdominal placque ruptures, and seven patients CEAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated for asymptomatic, symptomatic, and ruptured aortic pathologies in 20, and 4 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>; 61% had previous infrarenal aortic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The infrarenal aorta was the distal landing zone in 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In elective cases, simultaneous approach (n = 9, group I) and staged approach (n = 11, group II) were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up is 22 months (range 0.1-78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Primary technical success was achieved in 89% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> stent grafts were implanted in the entire thoracoabdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additionally, three patients had previous complete arch vessel revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Left subclavian artery was intentionally covered in three patients (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day mortality rate was 14.3% (4/28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One patient had a rupture before the staged endovascular procedure and died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Overall survival rate at 3 years was 70%, in group I 80%, and in group II 60% (P = .234) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Type I endoleak rate was 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> rate was 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Three patients required long-term dialysis (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Peripheral graft occlusion rate was 11% at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Gut infarction with consecutive bowel resection occurred in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between group I and II regarding <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early results of visceral hybrid repair for high-risk patients with complex and extended TAAAs and CEADs are encouraging in a selected group of high risk patients in whom open repair is hazardous and branched endografts are not yet optional </plain></SENT>
