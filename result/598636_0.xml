<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results concerning 7 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> (M.V.P.), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> members of the same familiar group, are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The anamnestic investigation for cardio-vascular deseases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> or other abnormalities referred to mesenchimopathies has been negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No subject with M.V.P. has referred subjective cardio-vascular symptoms nor radiological, ecgraphic and echo-phonomechanocardiographic signs of reduced cardiac function, have been pointed out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The phonomechanocardiographic tracings have shown a variable and low-amplitude click </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The echocardiographic tracings have shown a U-shaped (3 cases) and double U-shaped (1 case) pansystolic, early systolic (2 cases) and of doubtful classification (1 case) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>prolapse</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of the desease with not yet clear mechanism of genetic transmission is confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, environmental and genetic factors that interfere with the orderly valvular formation at a certain stage of the fetal development, are referred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Authors remark the necessity of further investigations, among more familiar groups, for identifying the genetic-environmental factors, that, eventually, could have any implication in the ethiopathogenetic mechanism of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The report of "silent" forms and the not yet completely known evolution of the M.V.P. don't justify its not-recognition </plain></SENT>
