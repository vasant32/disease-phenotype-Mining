<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The case report on a 33 year old woman with prominent features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Characteristic signs were seen in the bones, the eyes, the cardiovascular system, and the lungs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to regurgitation of both the aortic and mitral valves and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta a double valve replacement was made, including a prosthesis of the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The problems of early diagnosis and therapy of the life-threatening cardiovascular complications are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue specimens from the aorta were analysed histochemically and biochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histology showed a typical <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of the media with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biochemical analysis by in vitro labeling of collagen in tissue explants and by electron microscopical evaluation showed proportions of type I and type III collagen which were significantly different from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both the media and the adventitia the amount of type I collagen was drastically reduced as shown by quantitation of collagen and procollagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fibroblasts derived from the skin of the patient showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> content of type I and type III collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is conceivable that the reduced content of type I collagen in the aortic wall is responsible for the <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of the vessel wall causing formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and its sequelae </plain></SENT>
