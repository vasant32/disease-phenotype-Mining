<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nine eyes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001132'>lens subluxation</z:hpo> in seven patients (6 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, 1 with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001132'>lens subluxation</z:hpo>) were treated by <z:chebi fb="7" ids="33372">neodymium</z:chebi>:YAG (Nd:YAG) laser zonulysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The procedure uses an Nd:YAG laser to lyse the zonules to obtain a clear aphakic visual axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment best-corrected visual acuity was 20/60 or worse in eight eyes (6 eyes less than or equal to 20/200) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Movement of the crystalline lens was achieved after zonulysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases (100%), and a clear aphakic visual axis, sufficient to maintain aphakic correction without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> or glare, was obtained in eight eyes (88.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The procedure was combined with optical iridotomy in three cases (33.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five cases (55.6%) required more than one zonulysis treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity improved two or more Snellen lines in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> (7 eyes greater than or equal to 20/60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four cases had complications which included: <z:hpo ids='HP_0007906'>increased intraocular pressure</z:hpo> (IOP), mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001101'>iritis</z:hpo>, recurrent migration of the lens into the visual axis, and crystalline lens damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The final two complications necessitated eventual surgical removal of the lens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Nd:YAG laser zonulysis may be of benefit as an alternative treatment modality for selected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001132'>lens subluxation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
