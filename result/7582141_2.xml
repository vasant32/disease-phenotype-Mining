<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many patients had complicating conditions including <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (n = 13, eight native, five prosthetic valve), prosthetic valve dysfunction (n = 4), subvalvular obstruction (n = 3) treated by septal myectomy (n = 1) or modified Konno operation (n = 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (n = 2), ventricular septum defect (n = 1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264765,C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve disease</z:e> (n = 6), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rhd">rheumatic heart disease</z:e> (n = 4), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (n = 1), and extreme <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> operations were performed as free-standing total aortic root replacements </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients have developed early pulmonary homograft stenosis, which has required pulmonary homograft replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite these problems, we are enthusiastic about this operation and believe it may emerge as operation of choice for most patients under 60-65 years of age with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e> and for patients with prosthetic or advanced native aortic valve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With increasing frequency, our choice has been to proceed with a Ross operation, and currently, our only absolute contraindication is <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
