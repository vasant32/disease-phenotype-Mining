<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were no neurologic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The average preoperative major curve of 52 degrees (37-113 degrees) initially corrected to 30 degrees (6-94 degrees), and at last follow-up (range, 2-7 years), was 33 degrees (8-90 degrees) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was marked variability in curvature correction and maintenance of correction, with 14 patients progressively decreasing their curvatures postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Average preoperative Pedriolle vertebral rotation angle for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 92 patients was 16 degrees (4-26 degrees), which initially corrected to 14 degrees (0-24 degrees), and at last follow-up remained 14 degrees (0-23 degrees) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although SSI had little influence on rotation, 12 patients progressively decreased their rotational deformity after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aside from the positive influence of curve flexibility on the degree of postoperative curve correction, the authors could not identify factors explaining how curvature and vertebral rotation responded so variably to SSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors recommend continued use of SSI to stabilize curvatures in osteopenic patients (particularly those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular disease</z:e>), but rotational deformity will probably persist </plain></SENT>
