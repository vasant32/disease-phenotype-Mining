<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe an automatic method for studying vortical flow features using multidirectional magnetic resonance velocity imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The technique relied on the use of linear differential equations to provide local approximation to the acquired <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> velocity data and to identify vortical flow patterns that were characterised by their circular or swirling motion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two directional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> velocity images were acquired on a 0.5 T system with a TE of 14 ms, slice thickness of 10 mm, and field of view of 30-40 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The method was validated using numerical simulation, and the potential of this technique for studying blood flow features was demonstrated in the ascending aorta of a healthy volunteer and that of a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference in vortex flow dynamics of the left ventricle between a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subject and a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264733" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dilated ventricle</z:e> was also compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The approach of detecting critical flow features prior to analysing dynamical indices of the fluid is suited to the topological study of complex flow patterns depicted by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> velocity mapping techniques </plain></SENT>
