<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the morphological features at light microscopy of aortic tissue, removed at surgery in 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A separate group consisted of 24 patients who did not express the complete Marfan phenotype but had family members who displayed the full and typical features of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This group represented the so-called 'forme fruste' variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These two groups were compared with 12 patients in whom a histopathological diagnosis of Erdheim's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392775" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cystic medionecrosis</z:e> had been made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aortic tissue from post-mortem subjects were made available representing controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In each case the degree of elastic fragmentation and cystic change of the aortic media was assessed and tabulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that severe fragmentation of elastic is similarly identifiable in both Marfan and Marfan forme fruste groups and that differentiation is easy pathologically from subjects with the comparatively modest fragmentation seen in Erdheim's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392775" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cystic medionecrosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although cystic change was encountered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, its severity tended to parallel the age of the subject, and we consider from our study that Erdheim's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392775" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cystic medionecrosis</z:e> represents no more than an exaggerated age-related change </plain></SENT>
