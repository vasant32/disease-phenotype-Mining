<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the location of the intimal tear, the replacement of the ascending aorta was extended to the transverse arch in 42 patients (29.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred ten patients (78%) survived the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the same period, 32 patients had to be reoperated on once (n = 24) twice (n = 6), or three times (n = 2) for a total of 42 reoperations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients had had the initial repair in our institution, and 13 had been operated on elsewhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reoperation was indicated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e> (n = 4), recurring dissection (n = 7) threatening aneurysmal evolution of a persisting dissection (n = 28), or false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The redo procedure involved the aortic root and/or ascending aorta in 15 cases (group I), the transverse arch alone in 7 cases (group II), the transverse arch and the descending aorta or the descending aorta alone in 10 cases (group III), or the thoracoabdominal aorta in 10 cases (group IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk factors for reoperation have been analyzed in the 110 survivors initially operated on in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven of 18 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (38.8%) versus 12 of 92 without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> (13%) were reoperated on (p = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the 30 patients surviving arch replacement at initial repair required a reoperation, versus 19 of 80 (23.7%) patients surviving a replacement limited to the ascending aorta (p = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality rate of reoperation was 21.8% (7/32) with a risk of 16.6% (7/42) at each procedure (group I, 13.3%; group II, 0%; group III, 20%; group IV, 30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hospital mortality was influenced by emergency operation (5/10) (p &lt; 0.005) and thoracoabdominal replacement (3/10) (p &lt; 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The late survivals after reoperation are 65.1% +/- 17.6% at 1 year and 55% +/- 19.63% at 5 years (Kaplan-Meier, confidence interval 95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The late survivals, after the initial repair, of the patients undergoing reoperation are 89.6% +/- 11.0%, 79.3% +/- 14.7%, 53.9% +/- 18.1%, and 35.9% +/- 21.8% at 1, 5, 10, and 12 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> is an evolving process that may require one or several reoperations after the initial repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>At initial emergency operation, the resection of the entry site, when located on or extending to the transverse arch, has reduced the risk of reoperation, in our experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Elective reoperation must be considered before the occurrence of complications, especially in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
