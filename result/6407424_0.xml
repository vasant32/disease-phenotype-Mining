<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors report a series of 6 cases of recurrent dissection, 4 of which were treated surgically, out of a total of 64 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissections of the aorta referred to the CMC Foch, between January 1969 and October 1981 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three types of recurrent dissection were identified: --"de novo" recurrent dissection: a new dissection occurring in part of the aorta previously unaffected with a new intimal tear; --recurrent dissection due to extension of the previous dissection; --"in situ" recurrent dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surgery is the treatment of choice because of the poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extensive resection (sometimes carried out in several stages) and deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> are valuable techniques when part of the aorta giving off arteries to vital organs has to be replaced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The use of GRF biological glue in the treatment of the original <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection has been a significant advance in the prophylaxis of recurrent dissection as it ensures better repair of the distal false lumen (27% persistent false lumens) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With respect to an extensive replacement of the dissected vessel, the authors advise operation in several stages, especially in young subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> who are at high risk of recurrent dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection of the aorta, operated or not, should be followed up indefinitely with clinical and radiological examination, completed, when necessary, by an angioscan and an aortography </plain></SENT>
