<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> of the ascending aorta are classified into 2 distinct types according to their etiology and surgical treatment: aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, in which the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the aorta involves the initial portion of the aorta and includes the sinuses of Valsalva and supravalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>, which involve the ascending thoracic aorta above the sinuses of Valsalva </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography and CT scan are the main exams in the evaluation of the diameter of the ascending aorta and its follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conservative treatment by par ss-blockers and follow up by echocardiography once or twice a year is recommended for asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ss-blockers have demonstrated a slowing effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the aortic root and improve survival especially in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Beyond 50mm, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is at risk for complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Supravalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> can be treated by a simple supracoronary tube graft unlike aortic root <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in which replacement or repair of the aortic valve is often necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A family history and investigation of other members is essential in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
