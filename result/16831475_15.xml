<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of beta-blockade therapy on clinical outcome in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite the lack of definitive evidence to support its efficacy, beta-blocker therapy is widely used prophylactically in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A meta-analysis was instituted, which included studies identified by a systematic review of MEDLINE of peer-reviewed publications and by abstracts from annual scientific meeting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures of mortality and major morbidity were compared between patients treated and untreated with beta-blockade therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data was combined according to both a fixed-effects and random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The endpoints included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> or rupture, cardiovascular surgery, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six studies were included, 5 were non-randomized follow-up studies and 1 was a prospective randomized trial (802 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ninety-six of 433 patients treated with beta-blocker therapy and 74 of 369 untreated patients reached designated endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Utilizing a fixed-effects model, patients treated with beta-blocker therapy were more likely to reach an endpoint (odds ratio=1.50 with 95% CI 1.05-2.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, by a random-effects model, the treatment effect failed to reach significance (1.54 with 95% CI 0.99-2.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of this meta-analysis, there is no evidence that beta-blockade therapy has clinical benefit in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
