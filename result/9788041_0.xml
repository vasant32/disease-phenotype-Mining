<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case of a young woman affected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo>, who underwent a valve-sparing operation as described by Tirone David </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In many patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, aortic valve dysfunction is caused by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the sinotubular junction with distortion of the sinuses of Valsalva, and often with intact aortic valve leaflets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these patients, if the aortic valve leaflets are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at echocardiography, a more aggressive approach may be advisable in order to prevent irreversible damage to the aortic valve leaflets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We believe that surgery is indicated when the aortic root increases rapidly, even if it does not reach a diameter of 50 mm, which represents the current indication for asymptomatic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002631'>ascending aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This makes it possible to perform a valve-sparing operation instead of the composite replacement of the aortic valve and ascending aorta, which is still considered the standard treatment for these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The procedure described here represents an attractive choice for managing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> and annuloaortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> in Marfan patients, with the benefit of avoiding <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the well-known complications involved in prosthetic aortic valves </plain></SENT>
