<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A replacement of the abdominal aorta with visceral arteries as well as a wrapping of the descending thoracic aorta was performed in case 1 while a reconstruction of the descending thoracic aorta and infra-renal abdominal aorta was done in case 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After the reconstruction, both cases developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> DeBakey type I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another reconstruction of the ascending aorta was then urgently performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac catheterization after the second operation in case 1 revealed that the distensibility of the aorta had disappeared at the location of the vascular prosthesis while it had also decreased at the wrapped portion, and the maximum dp/dt of the ascending aorta also increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increases in the pulse pressure and pulse rate after the first operation were observed in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These hemodynamic changes, which were produced by a decreased distensibility of the reconstructed aorta, increased the mechanical stress to the native aortic wall, and may have been one of the causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> DeBakey type I occurring after reconstruction with a prosthesis </plain></SENT>
