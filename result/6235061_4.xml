<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 20 year (1963 to 1982) surgical experience including 175 consecutive patients with <z:disease ids="000181">aortic dissections</z:disease> was analyzed by logistic discriminant analyses to identify predictors of high operative risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient population had characteristics similar to those in large autopsy series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine percent had type A and 58% had acute dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intimal tear was located in the ascending aorta in 60% of the patients, the descending aorta in 27%, and the transverse arch in 13% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall operative mortality rate was 23 +/- 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The operative mortality rates were substantially lower between 1977 and 1982: mortality in patients with acute type A dissections, 7 +/- 5%; in those with chronic type A, 11 +/- 7%; in those with acute type B, 13 +/- 12%; and in those with chronic type B, 11 +/- 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After preliminary univariate screening, the following factors were determined to be significant independent predictors of operative mortality (in rank order of declining predictive power): type A patients (n = 121), renal dysfunction, <z:disease ids="000194">tamponade</z:disease>, renal/visceral ischemia, and operative date; type B patients (n = 54), rupture, renal/visceral ischemia, and age; all patients (n = 175), renal dysfunction, renal/visceral ischemia, site of tear (ascending less than descending less than arch), <z:disease ids="000194">tamponade</z:disease>, operative date, and pulmonary disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, several variables had no important bearing on operative mortality, including type (acute vs chronic) of dissection, age, previous operation, rupture, <z:disease ids="000726">stroke</z:disease>, paraplegia, Marfan's syndrome, concomitant aortic valve replacement and/or coronary artery bypass grafting, site of tear, and whether or not the tear was resected in type A patients; emergency operation, <z:disease ids="000468">hypertension</z:disease>, previous cardiac symptoms, paraplegia, site of tear, and resection of tear in type B patients; and, when all patients were considered together, age, sex, cardiac symptoms, prior operation, <z:disease ids="000726">stroke</z:disease>, paraplegia, acute <z:disease ids="000195">myocardial infarction</z:disease>, acute <z:disease ids="000179">aortic regurgitation</z:disease>, Marfan's syndrome, and tear resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data allow calculation of any individual patient's operative risk and document that the operative mortality rate today is relatively low for all patients with <z:disease ids="000181">aortic dissections</z:disease>, irrespective of type or acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Earlier surgical referral of patients with acute type A or acute type B dissection before irreversible major end-organ ischemia and/or infarction is probably in part responsible for the substantially improved results since 1977 </plain></SENT>
