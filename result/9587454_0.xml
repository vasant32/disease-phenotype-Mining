<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The coding gene of this large protein has been localised on chromosome 15 and partially cloned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its mutation is transmitted in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is common, affects many organs, especially those rich in collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They include the skeleton, the eye and cardiovascular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of these patients depends on the degree of cardiovascular involvement; the aorta is the principal site of the lesions, particularly the aortic root which tends to develop aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, then dissection, the main cause of premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>Mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> giving rise to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> may also be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Much progress has been made is recent years in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, especially in ultrasound follow-up of the aortic root and the definition of risk factors for dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In parallel, advances have been made in the treatment, both medical with the use of betablockers to try to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slow progression</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and surgical, in replacement of the aorta and aortic valve in time and under optimal conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Life expectancy is thereby significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similar progress has been made to allow these patients to have a pregnancy, classically thought to carry a high risk of maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
