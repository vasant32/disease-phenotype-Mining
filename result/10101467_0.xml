<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>Aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> and heart valve lesions are particularly common and presage a reduced life expectancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over the ensuring 20 years, however, treatment to prevent or correct the cardiovascular complications of the syndrome has changed dramatically--life expectancy for patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan syndrome</z:e> has increased &gt; 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reasons for this dramatic increase may include (1) an overall improvement in population life expectancy, (2) benefits arising from cardiovascular surgery, and (3) greater proportion of milder cases due to increased frequency of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular surgery, both prophylactic and emergent, has become accepted treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, beta-adrenergic receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> have gained wide acceptance as potential agents for delaying aortic expansion and progression to rupture or dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, medical therapy is also associated with an increase in probable survival </plain></SENT>
