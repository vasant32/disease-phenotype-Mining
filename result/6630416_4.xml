<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that physiological concentrations of T3 added to thyroid hormone-deficient media decreased the incorporation of [3H]<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> and [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">glucosamine</z:chebi> into <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycans</z:chebi> (GAG) in confluent cultures of skin fibroblasts obtained from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This inhibitory effect of T3 on [3H]GAG accumulation was due to a decrease in GAG synthesis, was independent of the substrate pool size or number of transfers in culture, and could be reversed by removal of hormone from the medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As shown in the current communication, it was also independent of the site of biopsy and age and sex of the donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fibroblast cultures were grown to confluence in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and then exposed for 3 days to medium deprived of thyroid hormone (10% bovine serum from a thyroidectomized animal) without or with the addition of T3, T4, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (DEX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After exposure to labeled substrate [(3H]<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> or [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">glucosamine</z:chebi>) for the last 24 h, their incorporation into GAG was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean +/- SD maximal inhibition of [3H]GAG accumulation in fibroblasts from 14 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects was 38.3 +/- 14.4% compared to 22.4 +/- 13.0% in fibroblasts from 8 patients with generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002930'>resistance to thyroid hormone</z:hpo> (GRTH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the difference was significant at the group level (P less than 0.05), there was a considerable overlap between the results obtained from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and those from patients with GRTH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, fibroblasts from 2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects failed to respond to T3 in several trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The specificity of the effect of T3 was examined in fibroblast cultures from eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and six patients with GRTH by comparing their responsiveness to T3 and to DEX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> fibroblasts obtained from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects that responded to T3 also responded to DEX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fibroblasts from the two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals that did not respond to T3 also failed to respond to T4 and to DEX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, fibroblasts from four of the six patients with GRTH had an attenuated response to T3, but not to DEX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Fibroblasts from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> responded normally to T3 despite increased incorporation of the substrate into GAG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The maximal inhibitory effect of T4 on [3H]GAG accumulation was identical to that of T3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, a 100-fold higher concentration of T4 was required.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
