<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aorta is considered pathologically dilated if the diameters of the ascending aorta and the aortic root exceed the norms for a given age and body size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 50% increase over the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diameter is considered aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such <z:hpo ids='HP_0005111'>dilatation of the ascending aorta</z:hpo> frequently leads to significant aortic valvular insufficiency, even in the presence of an otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dilated or aneurysmal ascending aorta is at risk for spontaneous rupture or dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of this risk is closely related to the size of the aorta and the underlying pathology of the aortic wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of rupture or dissection adversely alters natural history and survival even after successful emergency surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In recommending elective surgery for the <z:mp ids='MP_0010470'>dilated ascending aorta</z:mp>, the patient's age, the relative size of the aorta, the structure and function of the aortic valve, and the pathology of the aortic wall have to be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The indications for replacement of the ascending aorta in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection, intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> with annular destruction are supported by solid clinical information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgical guidelines for intervening in degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005111'>dilatation of the ascending aorta</z:hpo>, however, especially when its discovery is incidental to other cardiac operations, remain mostly empiric because of lack of natural history studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> with ascending <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> requires special attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There are a number of current techniques for surgical restoration of the functional and anatomical integrity of the aortic root </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The choice of procedure is influenced by careful consideration of multiple factors, such as the patient's age and anticipated survival time; underlying aortic pathology; anatomical considerations related to the aortic valve leaflets, annulus, sinuses, and the sino-tubular ridge; the condition of the distal aorta; the likelihood of future distal operation; the risk of anticoagulation; and, of course, the surgeon's experience with the technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Currently, elective root replacement with an appropriately chosen technique should not carry an operative risk much higher than that of routine aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Composite replacement of the aortic valve and the ascending aorta, as originally described by Bentall, DeBono and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> (classic Bentall), or modified by Kouchoukos (button Bentall), remains the most versatile and widely applied method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Since 1989, the button modification of the Bentall procedure has been used in 250 patients at Mount Sinai Medical Center, with a hospital mortality of 4% and excellent long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In this group, age was the only predictor of operative risk (age &gt; 60 years, mortality 7.3% [9/124] compared with age &lt; 60, mortality 0.8% [1/126], p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This modification of the Bentall procedure has set a standard for evaluating the more recently introduced methods of aortic root repair </plain></SENT>
