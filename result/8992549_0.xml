<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are often unrecognized and asymptomatic as shown in this case report and are only the cause of 1 to 4% of cerebral ischaemic accidents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, they are responsible for 5 to 20% of such accidents in adults younger than 30 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The nontraumatic nature of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> in our case has been suggested by the medical history although minor trauma could have been missed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A skin biopsy has enabled us to eliminate elastopathies such as Marfan's or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos</z:e>' syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of dissection has been suggested by a Doppler colour echography ; it was confirmed by the arteriography which revealed a long dissection looking like "string sign" at the level of the internal carotid artery just over the carotid bulb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As far as the evolution is concerned, a medical treatment made it quickly favourable </plain></SENT>
