<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The meta-analysis was instituted, which included studies identified by a systematic review of MEDLINE of peer-reviewed publications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Echocardiogram measurements of the aortic root dimension and outcome measures of mortality and major morbidity were compared between patients who were treated and untreated with beta-blockade therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five studies were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 224 young patients treated with beta-blocker therapy and 168 patients did not accept medical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with non-beta-blockade treatment, beta-blockade therapy significantly decreased the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMD</z:e> = -1.30 with 95% CI -2.11 to -0.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A tendency of clinical outcome beneficial was observed in the beta-blocker treatment group when compared with no beta-blocker treatment group (odds ratio = 0.87 with 95% CI 0.37-2.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is evidence that beta-blockade therapy can slow down the rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the aorta and has clinical benefits on children and adolescents with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
