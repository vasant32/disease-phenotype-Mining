<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The introduction of the 3D mode in echocardiography has led to its use in everyday clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and fifty real time 3D echocardiographic examinations were performed in 20 foetus, 110 children and 20 adults with various congenital heart lesions (shunts, valvular lesions, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic diseases</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 4x matricial probe enables the instantaneous acquisition of transthoracic volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four modes of 3D imaging were used: real time, total volume, colour Doppler and biplane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative measurements were performed at an outlying station </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The feasibility of the method in the foetus, the child and the adult was respectively 90%, 99% and 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Real time 3D echocardiography did not affect the diagnoses made by standard echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 3D imaging gave a more accurate description of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defects</z:hpo> and congenital valvular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Biplane imaging was decisive in the quantitative approach to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and in segmental analysis of the foetal heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>3D colour Doppler imaging has been disappointing but the possibilities of volumic quantification of blood flow are very promising </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present limitations of the method are the inadequate resolution in the small child and the absence of quantitative measurement on the echograph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The facility of utilisation of the matricial probe should lead to routine usage of 3D echocardiography as with 2D and the Doppler modes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Its value should be decisive in many congenital cardiac lesions requiring surgery or interventional catheterisation </plain></SENT>
