<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was the purpose of the study to elucidate clinical signs and prognosis in this rare and poorly understood condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 360 prospectively evaluated patients with clinical suspicion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, 195 patients presented with evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 25 patients (13.2%) had IMH of the thoracic aorta with no primary intimal tear, flap or overt dissection as shown by MRI (n = 12), contrast enhanced CT (n = 14) and TEE (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IMH was confirmed intraoperatively or at necropsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 16 men and 9 women of ages 56 +/- 13 years; arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was associated in 84% and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> in 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IMH involved the ascending aorta in 12 (48%), the arch in 2 (8%), and the descending aorta in 11 cases (44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IMH occupied 8.5 +/- 5 cm in length and 2.0 +/- 1.2 cm in aortic wall thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> and pericardial/mediastinal effusion was present in 42% of type A and in 18% of type B IMH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IMH progression to overt dissection, rupture and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> tamponade occurred in 8/25 cases (32%) within 24 to 72 h, indicating the need for urgent surgical repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 30-day mortality of IMH inflicting the ascending aorta was 80% (4 of 5) with medical treatment in contrast to none (of 7) with early surgical treatment (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One-year survival was 71% in surgically treated patients and 20% with medical treatment (p &lt; 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
