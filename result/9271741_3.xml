<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one patients (20.3%) suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's disease</z:e> (25 AN, 17 AD, 9 CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients (14.7%) had undergone a previous cardiac or aortic operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ascending aortic replacement was extended to the transverse arch in 31 patients (12.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A mechanical valve was used in 233 patients (92.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The classic "Bentall" technique was used in 87 patients (34.6%), the "button" technique in 121 patients (48.2%), the "Cabrol" technique in 26 patients (10.3%) and a "mixed" technique in 17 patients (6.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The hospital mortality accounts for 7.2% (18 out of 251) (AN: 4 out of 68, 2.3%, CD: 4 out of 36, 11.1%, AD: 9 out of 48, 18.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When emergencies are considered, the hospital mortality is 12 out of 54 (22.2%) versus 6 out of 197 (3%) in elective procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The predictors of hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were emergency, AD (p &lt; 0.03) and arch replacement (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean follow up is 38 +/- 15 months (4-262) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall long term survival rate is (Kaplan Me√Øer): 92 +/- 6% at one year, 77.9% +/- 9% at 5 years, 67.7 +/- 12% at 10 years, and 61.3 +/- 15% at 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 10-year survival rate is significantly higher in patients with AN (93 +/- 6%) than in patients with AD (61.6 +/- 17%) (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The late survival rate is also significantly higher after the "button" (93.8 +/- 5%) or Bentall's reimplantation (88.7 +/- 6%, 83.8 +/- 9%, and 76.6 +/- 12%) than after the "Cabrol" procedure (80 +/- 18%, 63 +/- 21% and 58 +/- 35%) at 1, 5, and 8 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ascending aortic replacement with a composite graft is a safe procedure, especially when performed electively in patients with dystrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The technique of coronary reimplantation has a significant influence of the long-term results, with the reimplantation of choice being the "button" technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The "Cabrol" technique must be used when the "button" or the "Bentall" reimplantation is not feasible </plain></SENT>
