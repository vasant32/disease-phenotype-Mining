<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To develop a mathematical model to demonstrate that ascending aortic curvature is an independent risk factor for type A dissections, in addition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of ascending aorta, and intrinsic aortic tissue abnormalities, like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A steady state one-dimensional flow analysis was performed, utilising Newton's third law of motion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five different clinical scenarios were evaluated: (1) effect of aortic curvature; (2) effect of beta-blockers, (3) effect of patient size, (4) forces on a Marfan's aorta, and (5) site of entry flap in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Aortic curvature increases the forces exerted on the ascending aorta by a factor of over 10-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aortic curvature can cause patients with a systolic blood pressure of 8 0mmHg to have greater forces exerted on their aorta despite smaller diameters and lower cardiac outputs, than patients with systolic blood pressures of 120 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diameter aortas, beta-blockers have minimal effect compared with aortic curvature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aortic curvature may help to explain why <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diameter aortas can dissect, and also that the point of the entry tear may be potentially predictable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aortic curvature has major effects on the forces exerted on the aorta in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aortic curvature is relatively more important that aortic diameter, blood pressure, cardiac output, beta-blocker use, and patient size with regard to the force acting on the aortic wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may explain why some patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diameter ascending aortas with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> develop type A dissections and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Aortic curvature may also help to explain the site of entry tear in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further clinical study is needed to validate this study's finding </plain></SENT>
