<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 24 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e>, eight (33.3%) were found to have ventricular dysrhythmias, including three with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six of these eight patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, and five had prolonged QT or QTU intervals corrected for heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, only two patients had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo>, five had only mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, and one had no detectable heart lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> and/or delayed repolarization in the development of ventricular dysrhythmia was explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Delayed repolarization, especially when combined with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, is associated with occurrence of ventricular dysrhythmia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serious ventricular dysrhythmia can occur in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> with or without substantial valve disease, and the dysrhythmia appears to progress with age </plain></SENT>
