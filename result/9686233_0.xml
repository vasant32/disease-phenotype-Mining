<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the recent literature, familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> have been documented by large epidemiological studies in Sweden and Finland, with a frequency as high as 6.7 to 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> have special characteristics concerning the age of the patient at the time of rupture, the location of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, the size of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> at the time of rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> is an argument for systematic screening, especially for patients aged between 30 and 65, when a familial occurrence of the disease has been clearly established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography is the most convenient method of screening, before intra-arterial arteriography is performed when an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is suspected </plain></SENT>
