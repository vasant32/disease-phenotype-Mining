<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We report the anesthesic and obstetrical management of two pregnant patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An important <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the root of aorta was established at the beginning of the pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on a review of the literature and our experience, we searched for clues to identify the ideal term and the best mode of delivery, and which type of anesthesia may be the more appropriate in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No consensus can be found in the literature as far as anesthesia and obstetric management of these patients is concerned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy must be continued as long as possible to ensure adequate fetal growth but fetal extraction should not be delayed if the diameter of the aorta enlarges too much </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A diameter of 40 mm is probably the higher limit to accept for vaginal delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Beyond, cautious cesarean section would be advisable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100775'>dural ectasia</z:hpo> or a technical problem, neuraxial anesthesia is a good option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: According to the severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001724'>aortic dilatation</z:hpo> and its evolution, specific management, based on good cooperation between obstetricians and anesthesiologists, is the key of a successful and safe childbirth </plain></SENT>
