 BACKGROUND/AIMS: Recently colonoscopy and screening programs have led to the detection and removal of increasing numbers of early colorectal cancer (ECC), which can reduce its related mortality. We analysed the clinical, endoscopic, and histologic findings, as well as the follow-up data, to evaluate the effectiveness and the long-term results of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) for ECC. METHODS: We analysed, retrospectively, 94 lesions in 92 patients who underwent EMR for ECC from January 2002 to June 2009. RESULTS: The overage age of patients was 60 years old. The mean follow-up period was 22.1 months (6-80). En bloc resection rate was 64.9%. Submucosal invasion was found in 30 cases (31.9%). De novo cancer rate was 26.6% which had higher submucosal invasion rate (60%, p=0.003). The complete resection rate was 87.2%, and there was no recurrence of cancer during follow-up (p=0.000). Twelve incomplete resection cases had received further surgical treatments. No procedure-related mortality was found and no recurrent malignancy was found except 1 case. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that EMR is an effective and safe treatment for ECC. En bloc resection provides precise histologic information and prevention of tumor recurrence.
