Sessile serrated polyps are a recently recognized type of neoplastic polyp that develops along a molecular pathway different from that of conventional adenomas. While the clinical significance of the serrated pathway to colorectal cancer is clear, further study is needed to understand a patient's lifetime colorectal cancer risk posed by serrated neoplasms and the optimal postpolypectomy surveillance interval.
