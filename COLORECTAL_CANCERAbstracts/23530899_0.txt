Germline deletions at the 3' end of EPCAM have been involved in the etiology of Lynch syndrome. The aim of this study was to characterize at the molecular level Spanish families harboring EPCAM deletions. Non-commercial MLPA probes and long-range PCR amplification were used to characterize each deletion. Haplotyping was performed by analyzing 8 microsatellite markers and 5 MSH2 SNPs. Methylation of MSH2 was analyzed by Methylation Specific-MLPA. Tumors diagnosed in 7 Spanish families harboring EPCAM deletions were almost exclusively colorectal. Mosaicism in MSH2 methylation was observed in EPCAM deletion carrier samples, being average methylation levels higher in normal colon and colorectal tumors (27.6 and 31.1%), than in lymphocytes and oral mucosa (1.1 and 0.7%). Three families shared the deletion c.858+2568_*4596del, with a common haplotype comprising 9.9Mb. In two families the novel EPCAM deletion c.858+2488_*7469del was identified. The present study provides knowledge on the clinical and molecular characteristics of mosaic MSH2 epimutations. The identification of an EPCAM founder mutation has useful implications for the molecular diagnosis of Lynch syndrome in Spain.
