 PURPOSE: To assess safety and efficacy of folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine (FFG) and folinic acid, fluorouracil, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX4) regimens with added bevacizumab as first-line treatment in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with Stage III unresectable or Stage IV adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum were randomly assigned to either FFG weekly for 6 weeks of an 8-week cycle or FOLFOX4 every 2 weeks. After FDA approval, bevacizumab 5 mg/kg was added every 2 weeks. Treatment continued until disease progression. Planned enrollment was 190 patients. Primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR); secondary endpoints included evaluation of adverse events, time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS). Disease Control Rate (DCR; % of patients with complete or partial responses or stable disease) was a post hoc analysis. RESULTS: The trial was stopped prematurely due to low enrollment. Of 84 enrolled patients (42 to each arm), 36 patients (18 in each arm) received bevacizumab. ORR was greater (P = .002) for FOLFOX4 (17/42; 40.5%) than for FFG (4/42; 9.5%); however, TTP, OS, and DCR results were not statistically different comparing FOLFOX4 and FFG. Peripheral neuropathy was more frequent (P = <.001) with FOLFOX4 (18/42; 42.9%) than with FFG (1/42; 2.4%). CONCLUSIONS: FFG and FOLFOX4 were generally well tolerated. Based on ORR, FOLFOX4 was superior to FFG. However, differences in TTP and OS comparing regimens were inconclusive. General use of gemcitabine as a biomodulator of 5-fluorouracil in CRC cannot be recommended at this time and the regimen remains investigational.
