 AIMS: To analyse patient survival after the resection of lung metastases from colorectal carcinoma and specifically to verify whether presence of liver metastasis prior to lung metastasectomy affects survival. METHODS: All patients who, between 1998 and 2008, underwent lung metastasectomy due to colorectal cancer were included in the study. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed with the log-rank test and Cox regression multivariate analysis. RESULTS: During this period, 101 metastasectomies were performed on 84 patients. The median age of patients was 65.4 years, and 60% of patients were male. The 30-day mortality rate was 2%, and incidence of complications was 7%. The overall survival was 72 months, with 3-and 5-year survival rates of 70% and 54%, respectively. A total of 17 patients (20%) had previously undergone resection of liver metastasis. No significant differences were found in the distribution of what were supposed to be the main variables between patients with and without previous hepatic metastases. Multivariate analysis identified the following statistically significant factors affecting survival: previous liver metastasectomy (p = 0.03), tumour-infiltrated pulmonary lymph nodes (p = 0.04), disease-free interval ≥ 48 months (p = 0.03), and presence of more than one lung metastasis (p < 0.01). In patients with previous liver metastasis, the shorter the time between primary colorectal surgery and the hepatectomy, the lower the survival rate after pulmonary metastasectomy (p = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: A previous history of liver metastasis shortens survival after lung metastasectomy. The time between hepatic resection and lung metastasectomy does not affect survival; however, patients with synchronous liver metastasis and colorectal neoplasia have poorer survival rates than those with metachronous disease.
