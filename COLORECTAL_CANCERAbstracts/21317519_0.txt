 BACKGROUND: Provider recommendation is critical for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening participation, yet few data exist on practices of providers serving American Indians and Alaska Natives. We examined Indian Health Service (IHS) and tribal provider practices, beliefs about screening efficacy, and perceptions of barriers. METHODS: We developed a Web-based questionnaire and recruited respondents via electronic distribution lists. We generated descriptive statistics by region, provider type, and workplace setting. RESULTS: Most respondents (77%) recommend starting CRC screening of average-risk patients at age 50; however, 22% recommend flexible sigmoidoscopy and 43% colonoscopy at intervals inconsistent with national guidelines. Of those recommending fecal occult blood test (FOBT), 23% use a single, in-office FOBT card as their only FOBT method. Respondents reported barriers to screening to include underutilized reminder systems and inadequate resources. CONCLUSIONS: Indian Health Service/tribal providers are knowledgeable about when to begin CRC screening; however, education about the appropriate use and frequency of CRC tests is needed.
