A 64-year-old woman was introduced to our hospital with liver tumors. Our examination revealed that she had advanced colon carcinoma with multiple liver metastasis. Without symptoms from the primary cancer, she underwent chemotherapy of avastin FOLFOX. After 2 courses of chemotherapy, she suffered ileus and underwent operation. The resected specimen showed marked tumor necrosis and fibrosis, but few tumor cells remained in the primary lesion. We think this was a rare case of suffered ileus because of marked response of chemotherapy in primary colon carcinoma.
