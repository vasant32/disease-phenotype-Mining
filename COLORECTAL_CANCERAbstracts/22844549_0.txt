Oxaliplatin in combination with a fluoropyrimide is a treatment option for colorectal cancer patients in the adjuvant and metastatic settings. Very few hematological emergencies have been reported associated with Oxaliplatin. These include autoimmune hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia. We present a case report of a patient who developed hematuria and disseminated intravascular coagulation while receiving the second cycle of FOLFOX and bevacizumab for metastatic colon cancer.
