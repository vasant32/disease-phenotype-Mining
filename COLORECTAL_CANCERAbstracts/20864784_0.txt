Colorectal cancers have potential for lymphatic and hematogenous metastases. Surgery is the definitive treatment, but the prognosis can be improved with the addition of chemotherapy, radiotherapy or both. However, the incidence of recurrence, both local and distant, remains significant. Distant metastases occur most often in the liver and lung; however, metastases to bone, adrenals, lymph nodes, brain, skin and the oral region have been reported. Metastases to the oral region are uncommon and may occur in the oral soft tissues or jaw bones. The prognosis in such patients is usually very poor. We report a case of colorectal carcinoma with metastasis to the floor of the mouth. This is probably the first reported case of metastasis to the floor of the mouth in a patient with colorectal cancer.
