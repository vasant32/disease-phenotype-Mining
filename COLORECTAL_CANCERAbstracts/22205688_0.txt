HER3 protein levels at the cancer cell plasma membrane are directly correlated with reduced survival in patients with colorectal cancer. In colorectal cancer cells, HER3 blockade restricted cellular growth (G(2)-M arrest), survival, migration, and invasion, and potentiated the chemotherapeutic effect of 5-FU, supporting strategies that target HER3 in subsets of patients with colorectal cancer.
