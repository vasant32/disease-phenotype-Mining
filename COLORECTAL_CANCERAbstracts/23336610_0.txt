The aim was to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) for in vivo diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) compared with conventional histology. METHODS: Consecutive patients underwent CLE examination for screening or surveillance colonoscopy were recruited. Suspected malignant lesions and adjacent mucosal sites were first examined by confocal imaging, and then the specimens of these sites were obtained using biopsy. Confocal images were independently interpreted by two endoscopists. The diagnosis made with CLE was compared with the conventional histologic diagnosis in a prospective and blinded fashion. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients with suspected malignant lesions were included in the study. A total of 74 lesions and 92 adjacent mucosal sites were observed. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of CLE in diagnosis of invasive growth CRC were 97.1%, 99.0% and 98.2% for endoscopist A, and 98.6%, 96.9% and 97.6% for endoscopist B, respectively. The interobserver agreement between the two endoscopists was excellent (Îº = 0.950). The accuracy in diagnosing poorly differentiated CRC using CLE was 97.0% for endoscopist A and 95.6% for endoscopist B. CONCLUSIONS: CLE has the potential to enable an immediate diagnosis of CRC and the degree of differentiation of CRC during ongoing endoscopy in vivo.
