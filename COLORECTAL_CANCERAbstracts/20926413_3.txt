 OBJECTIVE: We evaluated DNA amplificability to achieve a 100% success rate in KRAS mutation testing with dideoxy sequencing using formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded colorectal cancer tissue samples obtained from a recent clinical trial. METHODS: We evaluated the effects of deparaffinization, formalin fixation or storage time, and amplicon size on the amplificability of DNAs extracted from 19 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded colorectal cancer tissue samples. We subjected to KRAS mutation analysis 112 samples from metastatic colorectal cancer patients in 31 hospitals enrolled in a Phase II trial of a second-line FOLFIRI (5-fluorouracil+ leucovorin + irinotecan) + cetuximab regimen. RESULTS: Deparaffinization, formalin fixation and storage times did not appear to affect the recovery and amplificability of DNAs. However, amplicon size had a remarkable effect on the amplificability of DNAs. The smaller fragments with a size of ≤278 bp (96-278 bp) were successfully amplified with polymerase chain reaction in all samples tested, whereas the larger fragments with a size of ≥298 bp (298-565 bp) were not amplified. All samples from our clinical trial were successfully analyzed using three sets of primers with the amplicon sizes of 201, 221 and 240 bp, and KRAS mutations in exons 2 and 3 were detected in 49 of the 112 cases (43.8%). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the evaluation of DNA amplificability and amplicon size is important for the success of mutation detection tests such as the KRAS test with dideoxy sequencing using formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue samples in the clinical setting.
