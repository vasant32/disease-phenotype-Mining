 BACKGROUND: Several previous studies have identified narrow-band imaging (NBI) with magnification as being useful in evaluating early colorectal cancer invasion depth, but comparative diagnostic accuracy of invasion depth between pit pattern analysis using magnifying chromoendoscopy and NBI remains unclear. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare NBI and pit pattern analysis using magnifying chromoendoscopy in estimating early colorectal cancer invasion depth and to assess interobserver agreement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed a total of 72 early colorectal cancers in 72 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Each lesion image was subsequently reviewed by two experienced colonoscopists (A, B) and then classified clinically based on invasive/non-invasive pattern and Sano's capillary pattern classification with a five-point scale of confidence. RESULTS: In terms of diagnostic accuracy with confidence for A and B, the areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve were 0.84 and 0.81 for pit pattern analysis and 0.82 and 0.79 for NBI, respectively. Interobserver agreement for the diagnosis of submucosal deep (>1000 µm) invasion was evaluated for both modalities and indicated substantial agreement with pit pattern analysis (κ = 0.63) and moderate agreement with NBI (κ = 0.44). Conclusion:  Estimating invasion depth of early colorectal cancer using NBI appeared to have been comparable to pit pattern analysis, but there was greater interobserver variability using NBI.
