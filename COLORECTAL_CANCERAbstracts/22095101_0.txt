Kinase domains are the type of protein domain most commonly found in genes associated with tumorigenesis. Because of this, the human kinome (the protein kinase component of the genome) represents a promising source of cancer biomarkers and potential targets for novel anti-cancer therapies. Alterations in the human colon kinome during the progression from normal colon (NC) through adenoma (AD) to adenocarcinoma (AC) were investigated using integrated transcriptomic and proteomic datasets. Two hundred thirty kinase genes and 42 kinase proteins showed differential expression patterns (fold change ≥ 1.5) in at least one tissue pair-wise comparison (AD vs. NC, AC vs. NC, and/or AC vs. AD). Kinases that exhibited similar trends in expression at both the mRNA and protein levels were further analyzed in individual samples of NC (n = 20), AD (n = 39), and AC (n = 24) by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. Individual samples of NC and tumor tissue were distinguishable based on the mRNA levels of a set of 20 kinases. Altered expression of several of these kinases, including chaperone activity of bc1 complex-like (CABC1) kinase, bromodomain adjacent to zinc finger domain protein 1B (BAZ1B) kinase, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II subunit delta (CAMK2D), serine/threonine-protein kinase 24 (STK24), vaccinia-related kinase 3 (VRK3), and TAO kinase 3 (TAOK3), has not been previously reported in tumor tissue. These findings may have diagnostic potential and may lead to the development of novel targeted therapeutic interventions for colorectal cancer.
