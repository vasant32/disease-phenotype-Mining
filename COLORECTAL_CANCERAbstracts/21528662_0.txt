 AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Metastatic colorectal cancer has a heterogeneous behavior, and a set of patients will have minimal response and rapid disease progression. To understand this heterogeneity, studies have evaluated biological and clinical prognostic factors. Alkaline phosphatase seems to be a key prognostic factor, so we have reviewed the outcomes of our patients with respect to alkaline phosphatase levels. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Between January 2003 and December 2008, we treated with the FOLFOX 4 regimen 103 consecutive patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Thirty-two patients had alkaline phosphatase > or =300 U/l. RESULTS: Median time to progression was 4 months for patients with high alkaline phosphatase levels and 8 months for those with low alkaline phosphatase levels. Median overall survival was 8 and 17.5 months, respectively. Only 3 patients in the high alkaline phosphatase group obtained partial response (9.4%) compared to 3 complete responses and 24 partial responses (41.5%) in low alkaline phosphatase group. Toxicity was substantially different, with more grade 3-4 neutropenia, diarrhea and oral mucositis in the high than low alkaline phosphatase group. CONCLUSIONS: Alkaline phosphatase is an uncomplicated and potent prognostic factor. Patients with high alkaline phosphatase levels had a poor prognosis.
