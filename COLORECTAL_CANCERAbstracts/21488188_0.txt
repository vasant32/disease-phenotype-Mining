 PURPOSE: Transplant recipients in Asia appear to be at a higher risk for developing colorectal cancer (CRC). This study was performed to identify the clinicopathological features and oncologic outcomes of CRC in post-renal transplants in Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 17 patients with CRC out of 2,630 recipients who underwent renal transplantation between 1994 and 2007. These patients (transplant group) were compared with general CRC patients (n=170, control group) matched, based on the closest date of surgery to the transplant group. RESULTS: During 29.7 months of the median follow- up period, the recurrent and survival rates from recurrence were worse in the transplant group than in the control group (35.2% versus 15.2%; p=0.048 and p=0.025). The 2-year patient survival rate of the transplant group was significantly worse than the control group in advanced cancer (stages III-IV; 45.7% versus 71.6%; p=0.023). In early cancer (stages 0-I), there was no significant difference in 5-year patient survival rate between the two groups (100% versus 92.6%, respectively; p=0.406). CONCLUSION: In spite of a poor prognosis of advanced CRC in the transplant group, the early stage CRC of the transplant group showed a comparable oncologic outcome compared with the control group. Regular screening and early detection of CRC are essential in the post-transplant setting.
