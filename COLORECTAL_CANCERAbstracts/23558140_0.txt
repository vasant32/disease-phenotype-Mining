Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common form of human cancer. Diverse therapies such as surgery and chemotherapy have shown excellent results in CRC. However, they still have limitations. There is a need to develop new CRC treatment strategies. Probiotic formulations have shown excellent promises in CRC as modest, preventive and early stage therapeutics. This review summarizes the recent development of probiotics in CRC and highlights the importance of the intestinal microbiota balance in CRC, cover current research on probiotics for CRC prevention and treatment with emphasis on the mechanisms involved. Specifically, this report describes evidences on the role of probiotics in inhibiting tumor progression, in reducing oxidative stress, in reducing colon cell DNA damage, in producing anti-cancer compounds, in improving the microflora balance, in stimulating the host immune response and in other physiochemical conditions of the gut. Even though, some of these effects were observed in several human trials when probiotics formulations were used as a supplement with CRC therapies, the application of probiotics as a biotherapeutic against CRC still needs further investigations.
