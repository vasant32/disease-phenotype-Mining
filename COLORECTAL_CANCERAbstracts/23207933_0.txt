5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA) are widely used to treat patients with ulcerative colitis. Experimental data suggest that these agents can potentially be used in a chemopreventive fashion to inhibit the development of colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CRC); however, observational studies investigating a possible risk reduction of CRC by 5-ASA therapy have revealed conflicting results. Currently, it appears that 5-ASA have no or only a very limited effect as a deterrence against CRC. Thus, a general recommendation for long-term use of 5-ASA solely for chemopreventive measures is not warranted.
