Diallyl disulfide (DADS), one of the major organosulfur compounds of garlic, is recognized as a group of potential chemopreventive compounds. In this study, we examines the early signaling effects of DADS on human colorectal cancer cells SW480 loaded with Ca(2+)-sensitive dye fura-2. It was found that DADS caused an immediate and sustained rise of [Ca(2+)](i) in a concentration-dependent manner (EC(50) = 232 μM). DADS also induced a [Ca(2+)](i) elevation when extracellular Ca(2+) was removed, but the magnitude was reduced by 45%. Depletion of intracellular Ca(2+) stores with 2 μM carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, a mitochondrial uncoupler, didn't affect DADS's effect. In Ca(2+)-free medium, the DADS-induced [Ca(2+)](i) rise was abolished by depleting stored Ca(2+) with 1 μM thapsigargin (an endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump inhibitor). DADS-caused [Ca(2+)](i) rise in Ca(2+)-containing medium was not affected by modulation of protein kinase C activity. The DADS-induced Ca(2+) influx was blocked by nicardipine (10 μM). U73122, an inhibitor of phospholipase C, abolished ATP (but not DADS)-induced [Ca(2+)](i) rise. These findings suggest that DADS induced a significant rise in [Ca(2+)](i) in SW480 colon cancer cells by stimulating both extracellular Ca(2+) influx and thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular Ca(2+) release via as yet unidentified mechanisms.
