In stage III colorectal cancer, patients with N1 stage tumors show poorer outcome than patients with N2 stage tumors. Our objective was to identify genes that are predictive for the presence of lymph node metastasis, and to characterize the aggressiveness of lymph node metastases. Gene expression profiles of colorectal cancer were determined by microarray in training (n = 116) and test (n = 25) sets of patients. We identified 40 discriminating probes in patients with and without lymph node metastases. Using these probes, we could predict the presence of lymph node metastasis with an accuracy of 87.1% (training set) and 76.0% (test set). Among discriminating probes, FOXC2 expression was significantly correlated with the degree of lymph node metastasis. FOXC2 was expressed significantly and disparately in patients with N1 and N2 stage tumors as analyzed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. FOXC2 appears to be involved in determining the aggressiveness of lymph node metastasis in colorectal cancer.
