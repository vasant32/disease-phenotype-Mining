Obesity and related metabolic alterations have been implicated to play a role in colorectal cancer risk. The metabolic syndrome, as assessed according to current international definitions by the key components, abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure, and abnormal glucose metabolism, is associated with colorectal cancer. Recent studies suggest that abdominal obesity and abnormal glucose metabolism may primarily account for this association. Visceral adipose tissue is physiologically more active than subcutaneous adipose tissue and generates hormones and cytokines with inflammatory, metabolic, and direct carcinogenic potential, which may directly or indirectly increase colorectal cancer risk. Current evidence suggests that obesity acts as a risk factor for colorectal cancer by several mechanisms, including chronic low-grade inflammation, hyperinsulinemia, as well as alterations in insulin-like growth factor and adipokine concentrations. Metabolic biomarkers reflecting these processes may not only provide clues for etiological understanding of colorectal carcinogenesis but also might be an alternative way to define an "obesity phenotype" that is relevant for colorectal cancer development.
