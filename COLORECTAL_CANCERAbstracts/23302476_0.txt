 OBJECTIVES: To analyze the survival outcomes of the surgery for colorectal cancer with liver metastases (CRCLM), and study the mode of multi-disciplinary team (MDT) for CRCLM. METHODS: The retrospective analysis was conducted for 38 patients with CRCLM received MDT management and surgical treatment from January 2009 to August 2011. The peri-operative and survival outcomes of MDT and surgery were evaluated. RESULTS: All the cases met the present criteria of resetability for CRCLM, but only 4 cases (10.5%) met the previous one. Coloproctectomy and hepatectomy were performed in all cases, with 39 colorectal neoplasms and 155 liver lesions removed. One case died of postoperative septic shock. Colorectal and hepatic specific complications were absent in the others patients except one case of biliary leak which was treated with conservative management. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was arranged in 13 cases. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered for every patient. After a mean follow-up of (22 Â± 10) months according to the finding time of liver metastases, recurrence and metastases were observed in 16 cases and 6 cases died of late-stage cachexia. The 1-, 2- and 3-overall survival rate were 94.4%, 85.3% and 75.8% respectively, and the 1-, 2- and 3-disease-free survival rate were 70.1%, 54.2% and 54.2% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MDT mode for resectable CRCLM is recommendable. Surgical resection of CRCLM is feasible and safe, which seems to achieve favourable short-middle oncologic outcomes. And long-term survival is expected.
