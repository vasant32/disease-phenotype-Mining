 BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced cancer may present with obstructive jaundice. Biliary stenting is the treatment of choice. However, which patients benefit most is not well-defined, yet. Our aim was to delineate the clinical factors affecting prognosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Charts of 140 patients with advanced cancer who underwent biliary stenting were retrospectively analyzed. Their median age was 63.5 years. Of these patients, 73 (52.1 %) were male, 32 (22.9 %) had ECOG PS 1 and 81 (57.9 %) had PS 2. The most frequent cancer types were cholangiocellular cancer (64, 45.7 %) and pancreatic cancer (36, 25.7 %). RESULTS: Median overall survival (OS) was 141 (95 % CI, 100.7-185.3) days. Female patients lived longer (161.0 vs. 124.0 days) (p = 0.036). Those patients with colorectal cancer lived the longest (667.0 days), followed by cholangiocellular (211.0 days), and gastric cancers (106.0 days) (p = 0.004). The distribution of primary diagnosis differed significantly between sexes: cholangiocellular cancer was present in 22 (30.1 %) out of 73 men and 42(62.7 %) out of 67 women (chi-square p < 0.001). There was a trend for longer overall survival if ALT (p = 0.08) and AST (p = 0.06) were normalized after stent insertion. Of the 137 patients, 63 (45.5 %) did not experience any complication. In 74 patients with complications, there were 39 (28.5 %) episodes of cholangitic infections and 35 (25.5 %) biliary obstructions. In three patients, we could not find data on infections. CONCLUSION: Underlying malignancy, hence the natural biology and the therapeutic expectations are probably the most important factors which must be considered during decision-making.
