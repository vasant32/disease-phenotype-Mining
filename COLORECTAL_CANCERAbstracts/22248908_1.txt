Treatment of metastasized colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-directed monoclonal antibodies is driven by the results of the KRAS mutational status (wild type [WT]/mutated [MUT]). To find out as to what extent the treatment selection based on the KRAS status had impact on overall costs, a retrospective analysis was performed. Of 73 mCRC patients 31.5% were MUT carriers. Costs of EGFR inhibitor treatment for WT patients were significantly higher compared to those for patients with MUT (p = 0.005). Higher treatment costs in WT carriers reflect a significantly higher number of treatment cycles (p = 0.012) in this cohort of patients. Savings of drug costs minus the costs for the determination of KRAS status accounted for EUR 779.42 (SD Â±336.28) per patient per cycle. The routine use of KRAS screening is a cost-effective strategy. Costs of unnecessary monoclonal EGFR inhibitor treatment can be saved in MUT patients.
