 PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the risk factors for early recurrence in patients who had undergone curative resection of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) and to evaluate the outcome after recurrence. METHODS: A total of 119 patients were divided into 2 groups: an early recurrence group (n = 54) who had recurrence within 2 years of curative resection of CRLM and a 2-year recurrence-free group (n = 65) who remained disease-free for at least 2 years following surgery. RESULTS: During the initial 5-year period after surgery, 4 out of 65 patients (6%) in the 2-year recurrence-free group and 29 out of 54 patients (54%) in the early recurrence group died. Multivariate analysis showed that postoperative morbidity was an independent predictor of early recurrence after curative resection of CRLM. CONCLUSIONS: Early recurrence is the leading cause of death within 5 years after curative resection of CRLM. Postoperative morbidity increases the risk of early recurrence in these patients. A reduction in perioperative morbidity may, therefore, improve the outcome of curative resection, as well as reducing medical costs.
