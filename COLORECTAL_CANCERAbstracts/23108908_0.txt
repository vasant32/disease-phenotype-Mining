Integrin-linked kinase (ILK), an intracellular serine-threonine kinase, has been reported to be overexpressed in multiple types of human malignancies, including colorectal cancer (CRC). The prognostic value of ILK in CRC, however, remains unknown. In the present study, expression of ILK in 25 paired primary CRC samples and adjacent noncancerous tissues were quantified using real-time PCR and Western blotting. ILK protein expression was analyzed in 102 archived, paraffin-embedded CRC samples using immunohistochemistry. The correlation between ILK expression and clinicopathological factors was evaluated by the χ(2) test. Patients' overall survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. We found that both ILK mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly up-regulated in primary CRC samples compared with their corresponding normal tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed relative high expression of ILK in 43 of 102 (42.2 %) primary CRC samples. Statistical analysis showed a significant correlation of ILK expression with tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis, tumor invasion, and tumor-node-metastasis stage. Patients with tumors displaying high-level ILK expression showed significantly shorter overall survival (P = 0.028, log-rank test). More importantly, multivariate analysis indicated that high ILK protein expression was an independent prognostic factor for CRC patients (P = 0.026). Taken together, our data suggest that ILK overexpression is associated with tumor progression and a poor prognosis in CRC patients and may represent a novel potential prognostic marker for patients with CRC.
