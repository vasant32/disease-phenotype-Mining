The purpose of this study was to evaluate expression and prognostic value of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. CRC tissues and corresponding distal normal mucosa tissues of 118 CRC patients were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Correlations between MMP-7 expression, patients' clinic pathological features, and overall survival rate were analyzed. We found that positive expression of MMP- 7 in CRC tissues was significantly higher than that in distal normal mucosa (61.0% vs. 39.8%, p=0.001). Poor histological differentiation, advanced clinical stage and lymph node metastasis were significantly correlated with MMP-7 expression in CRC. The overall survival rate was significantly higher in the MMP-7 negative group than the positive group (Log-rank test=9.957, p=0.002). MMP-7 appeared as a significant independent prognostic factor through multivariate survival analysis. Collectively, we found MMP-7 expression to be correlated with progression and metastasis of CRC and thus could be used as a predictive marker of prognosis in CRC patients.
