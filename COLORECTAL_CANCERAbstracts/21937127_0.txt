Elderly patients constitute a subpopulation with special clinical features that differ from those of the general population and are under-represented in clinical trials. We retrospectively analyzed the toxicity and efficacy of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in the treatment of elderly patients affected by metastatic (m) CRC. Seventy-five consecutive patients aged 65-75 years (median age 71 years), 51 males and 24 females, with mCRC and measurable disease, were analyzed. The primary site of metastases was the liver (38.6% of patients). The majority of patients had a performance status (PS) according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS before treatment of 0-1 (96%). The overall response rate was 57.3%, median progression-free survival was 7 months and median overall survival was 27 months. The main hematological and extra-hematological toxicities (grade 3 or 4) were neutropenia (20.0%), and neurological toxicity or diarrhea (6.7%), respectively. No toxic death occurred. Oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy maintains its efficacy, and safety in elderly patients with mCRC and good PS. This regimen should be considered in the treatment of this particular setting of patients.
