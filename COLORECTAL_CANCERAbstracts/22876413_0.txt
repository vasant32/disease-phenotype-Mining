 OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether health insurance coverage of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening varied based on risk. BACKGROUND: Population-wide screening guidelines for cancer often incorporate risk information, with modified screening recommendations for those at higher risk due to family history or other factors. METHODS: In a nationwide Internet- and mail-based survey of health insurance plan medical directors, respondents were asked about their organization's policies towards coverage of CRC screening for persons at average and higher risk of CRC. Additional questions asked about whether the insurer had a definition of increased risk, and coverage of genetic testing for familial CRC syndromes. RESULTS: Survey invitations were sent to 1158 medical directors; 133 (11%) completed the survey. All plans covered screening for average and high-risk persons. The onset of screening was earlier and intervals were more frequent for higher risk compared to average risk persons, with most respondents stating coverage was determined by "physician discretion." While 75% had a definition of high risk, only 55% covered genetic testing. CONCLUSIONS: Most insurers offer enhanced coverage of CRC screening, most commonly following the discretion of the physician. Whether this coverage results in earlier, more frequent, or more complete screening of higher risk persons remains uncertain.
