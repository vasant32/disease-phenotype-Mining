Background/Aims: Using genome-wide case-control association approach, the current study aimed to determine whether genetic polymorphism(s) is/are associated with H. pylori infection among ethnic Malays from the north-eastern region of Peninsular Malaysia, a region with an exceptionally low prevalence for H. pylori infection and gastric cancer. Methodology: Twenty-three Malay subjects positive for H. pylori confirmed with urease test and histology were enrolled as "cases" and 37 subjects negative for H. pylori were "controls". Both groups were matched for age and environmental risks. Extracted DNA samples (QIAGEN, Germany) from the venous blood of study subjects were genotyped using the Human Mapping 50k xba1 array (Affymetrix, USA). High throughput downstream analyses were then used to determine the significant SNP(s) associated with H. pylori infection. Results: Out of 20,361 SNPs filtered using the genotype association test, the top 1% (203) significant SNPs were selected for functional enrichment analysis. Of the 15 "enriched" SNPs, the rs10502974 which was located within the intronic region of Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) gene was the SNP most significantly associated with H. pylori infection (p=0.00549). Conclusions: Ethnic Malays is genetically susceptible to H. pylori infection and is possibly mediated through a genetic variation in the DCC gene.
