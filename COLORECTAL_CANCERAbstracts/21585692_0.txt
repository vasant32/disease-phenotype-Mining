 AIM: In Japan the combination of fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) was approved as adjuvant therapy for stage III or high-risk stage II colon cancer only in September 2009. In this study we evaluated the safety and efficacy of FOLFOX as adjuvant chemotherapy for stage IIIb or IV colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in a Japanese group at a single institute. METHODS: A total of 45 consecutive patients received 12 cycles of adjuvant FOLFOX for stage IIIb (n = 31) or IV (n = 14) CRC. Toxicity and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The median dose intensities of oxaliplatin and 5-FU were 0.7 and 0.74, respectively. Oxaliplatin was discontinued in 10 (22%) patients due to an allergic reaction in five, neurotoxicity in four and gastrointestinal toxicity in one. No severe neurotoxicity occurred. The median duration from completion of treatment until complete recovery from peripheral neuropathy was 582 days (95% CI, 486-678). Two-year DFS for stages IIIb and IV was 56.9% and 56.3%, respectively (log-rank, P = 0.533). Univariate analysis revealed that severe vessel invasion, liver metastasis and higher baseline levels of CA19-9 were associated with shorter DFS in stage IV patients. Multivariate analysis including the selected biomarkers revealed none as a significant prognostic factor. CONCLUSION: Adjuvant FOLFOX was well tolerated in a Japanese cohort of both stage IIIb and IV CRC patients.
