 OBJECTIVES: The relationship between malignant tumours and blood coagulation disorders is generally well known. BACKGROUND: The authors notice blood coagulation in patients with colorectal cancer and evaluate prothrombotic markers. METHODS: The authors analyzed a group of 137 patients with malignant tumour of colon and rectum, drew attention to the relationship between level of D-dimer, PAI-1, F 1+2, Protein C and the progress of malignant tumour, its localization, clinical stage, histopathology type, method of surgery considering the stapling use. RESULTS: Very aggressive and advance tumours have high level of D dimer, plasminogen activator inhibitor I (PAI-1). Prothrombotic fragments 1+2 were significantly higher by anastomotic dehiscence. Protein C level was lower by age from sixty to seventy and in advanced clinical stage. CONCLUSION: Pre-operative surveys of D dimer, PAI-1, prothrombotic fragments and Protein C give informations abaout risk of thrombosis, far gone of malignant diseases, they clinical stage and histological type. D dimer and PAI-1 have the most clinical value (Fig. 5, Ref. 11).
