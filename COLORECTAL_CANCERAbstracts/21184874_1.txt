 BACKGROUND: Preferences toward endoscopists have been shown to be a barrier to colorectal cancer screening in certain patient populations. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate sex and ethnicity preferences for endoscopists in a largely Hispanic population. METHODS: This was a prospective cross-sectional study. Patients were given an anonymous questionnaire in which information on demographics and sex/ethnic preferences for endoscopists was determined. Bivariate and multivariate models were used to assess factors that affected outcome variables. RESULTS: A total of 438 patients were included (213 men, 225 women; mean age 62 years). Predominant ethnicities were white (44%) and Hispanic (45%). Twenty-six percent and 17% of patients expressed sex and ethnicity preferences, respectively. Women (30.8%), particularly Hispanic women (35%), had a sex preference more often than men (20.4%; P < .05). Hispanics had an ethnicity preference more often than white patients (P < .01). Lower education level, being a first-generation immigrant, family history of colorectal cancer, having a concurrent preference for obstetrician/gynecologist, and ethnicity preference for endoscopist were associated with the presence of a sex preference for the endoscopist (P < .05). Being a first-generation immigrant and having an ethnicity preference for a primary care provider or the sex of the endoscopist were significantly associated with a preference for the ethnicity of the endoscopist (P < .05). LIMITATIONS: Results are based on self-report. Limited study factors were also assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Among a predominant Hispanic population, sex and ethnicity preferences for endoscopists are often seen. They may coexist, increase the likelihood of the presence of one when the other is present, and likely influence compliance with colorectal cancer screening.
