 AIM: To evaluate the performance of digital tomosynthesis (DT) of the chest for detection of lung nodules in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this study, and all patients provided informed consent. A commercial caesium iodide/amorphous silicon (CsI/a-Si) flat-panel detector system was used to verify the performance of the DT and chest radiography (XR) methods. DT was performed in 142 patients with CRC. All 142 patients underwent chest computed tomography (CT) within a week of DT. As a reference standard, two radiologists reviewed the chest CT in consensus and recorded the presence of pulmonary nodules. Another two radiologists independently observed the DT images and recorded the presence of pulmonary nodules. The status of all lung nodules was assessed either histologically or by follow-up over a period of 1 year. The nodules were classified into metastasis, benign, and uncertain. Statistical analysis of the results was performed. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-seven nodules from 142 patients were found at CT. These included 71 proven metastases and 126 benign nodules; 40 nodules were uncertain. Observers detected 83% of all lung nodules and 93% of proven metastases using DT. Among 237 nodules, 147 nodules were larger than 4mm in diameter on the CT images. Observers detected 87% of lung nodules that were larger than 4mm. CONCLUSION: Despite a reasonably low radiation dose, DT is a sensitive method, and is comparable to chest CT for the detection of lung nodules, particularly metastatic lung nodules in patients with CRC.
