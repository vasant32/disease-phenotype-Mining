 BACKGROUND: There is general concern that high-risk patients are more susceptible to the adverse effect of pneumoperitoneum and they are often denied laparoscopic surgery. This study investigated the impact of laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection for patients with high operative risk, which was defined as American Society of Anesthesiologist classes 3 and 4. METHODS: Three hundred thirty-five consecutive high-risk patients who had colorectal cancer resection by open or laparoscopic surgery were included. The patient and tumor characteristics and operative outcomes were recorded prospectively, and comparison was made between the two groups. RESULTS: Compared to open surgery, patients with laparoscopic resection had a shorter hospital stay (8 [6-12] vs. 6 [4-9] days; P < 0.001), less blood loss (200 [100-400] vs. 140 [80-250] mL; P = 0.006), reduced cardiac complication rate (13.2% vs. 3.7%; P = 0.006), overall operative complication rate (36.6% vs. 21.3%; P = 0.006), and a trend toward a lower mortality rate (4.4% vs. 0.9%; P = 0.083). There was no difference in 3-year overall and disease-free survival between two groups. Operative blood loss (P = 0.035; odds ratio = 2.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-6.78) and open surgery (P = 0.007; odds ratio = 2.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-4.23) were independent factors for occurrence of complication. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection is associated with more favorable short-term results and should be recommended as the preferred treatment option for high-risk patients.
