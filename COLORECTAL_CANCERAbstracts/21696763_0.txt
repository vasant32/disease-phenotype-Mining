 BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer patients require care across different disciplines. Integration of multidisciplinary care is critical to accomplish excellent oncologic results. We hypothesized that the establishment of a dedicated colorectal cancer center (CRCC) around specialty-trained surgeons will lead to increased multidisciplinary management and improved outcomes in colorectal cancer patients. METHODS: We analyzed data from three periods: a baseline group, a period after the recruitment of specialty-trained surgeons, and a period after the creation of a dedicated multidisciplinary cancer center. Data analyzed included surrogate markers of surgical oncologic care, multidisciplinary integration, and oncologic outcomes. RESULTS: Recruitment of specialized surgeons led to improvements in surgical oncologic care; the establishment of the CRCC resulted in further improvements in surgical oncologic care and multidisciplinary integration. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that although the recruitment of specialty-trained surgeons in a high volume center leads to improvement in surgical oncologic care, it is the establishment of a multidisciplinary center around the surgeons that leads to integrated care and improvements in oncologic outcomes.
