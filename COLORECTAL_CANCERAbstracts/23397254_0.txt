PURPOSE: To assess the effectiveness of using sodium hyaluronate-based bioresorbable membrane (Seprafilm(®)) versus 4 % icodextrin solution (Adept(®)) versus no additive intraoperatively and to prevent postoperative small-bowel obstruction in patients undergoing colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery. METHODS: The subjects of this retrospective study were 454 patients, who underwent CRC surgery between February 2007 and January 2010. Among the 454 enrolled patients, 114 patients received Seprafilm(®), 180 patients received Adept(®), and 160 patients received no additive, based on the year of their surgery. RESULTS: The overall incidences of small-bowel obstruction were 8.8, 4.3, and 6.9 %, for the Adept(®), Seprafilm(®), and no additive (control) groups, respectively. The cumulative incidence was significantly higher in the Adept(®) group than in the Seprafilm(®) and control groups (Adept(®) vs. Seprafilm(®), P = 0.043; Adept(®) vs. control group, P = 0.002). No significant difference was found between the Seprafilm group and the control group (P = 0.549). Adept(®) solution and Seprafilm(®) did not alter the liver and renal function, as assessed by blood chemistry. CONCLUSIONS: The use of Adept(®) significantly increased the incidence of small-bowel obstruction in patients undergoing CRC surgery.
