According database of Globocan 2008 of total 482 thousand worldwide new esophagel cancers are reported 16.9% cases in more developed and 83.1% in less developed regions, 6.9% in EU, 2.7% in the Eastern Europe; of total 989 thousand new stomach cancers are reported 27.8% in more developed and 72.2% in less developed regions, 8.4% in EU, 7.4% in the Eastern Europe; of total 1.235 milion new colorectal cancers are reported 59% cases in more developed and 41% in less developed regions, 27% in EU, 10.5% in the Eastern Europe. Of total 59,052 all neoplasms (without skin cancers) were reported 10,439 new cases of these three diagnoses in recent Czech Cancer Registry survey, higher by 595 cases than numbers based in Globocan 2008. However, according to these data the Czech males reached the 3rd order and females the 14th order by their cumulative risk of colorectal cancer in the world. The alarming worldwide numbers of new 4.771 milion of these three diagnoses and 3,137 thousands deaths from them, expected in 2030 with a higher risk in population of less developed regions require greater international cooperation and personal responsibility for improving the life-style, which would be failed the expected statistics.
