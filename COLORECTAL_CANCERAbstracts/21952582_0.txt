The performance of combining fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) and a high-risk factor questionnaire (HRFQ) in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in economically and medically underserved populations is uncertain. This study investigated the performance of a CRC screening protocol of combining FITs and an HRFQ as primary screening methods in a rural Chinese population. A CRC mass screening was conducted using FITs and an HRFQ as the first and colonoscopy as the second stage of screening in Jiashan, 2007-2009. The target population was 31,963 residents in three communities. The compliance was 84.7% for HRFQ, 76.4% for FITs, and 78.7% for colonoscopy. The detected rates of cancer, adenoma, nonadenomatous polyps, and advanced neoplasm were 2.7%, 14.8%, 5.9%, and 8.9% by FITs, which were higher than those by HRFQ (0.5%, 9.2%, 4.8%, and 3.8%, respectively). There was no significant difference in detected rate for nonadenomatous polyps between FITs and HRFQ. A total of 41.2% adenomas, 53.2% nonadenomatous polyps, and 29.8% advanced neoplasms were detected by HRFQ but missed by FITs. Positive predictive value of the screening protocol of combining FITs and HRFQ for advanced neoplasm was 5.7%, which was higher than FITs alone. Men had a higher prevalence of advanced neoplasm than women. Results indicate that combining FITs and HRFQ as primary screening methods is an efficient CRC screening strategy in economically and medically underserved populations.
