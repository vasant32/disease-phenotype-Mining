 PURPOSE: The cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) oncoprotein is overexpressed in colon cancer tissue compared to normal colon mucosa. We investigated the impact of CIP2A on colon cancer. METHODS: A tissue microarray consisting of 167 colon cancer specimens was investigated. The association between CIP2A and clinicopathological parameters was analyzed using the χ(2) test. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The impact of CIP2A on proliferation and drug resistance was evaluated using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide test. An anchorage-independent colony formation assay was also performed. RESULTS: CIP2A was an independent prognostic factor in colon cancer after controlling for other clinical confounding factors, such as stage and lymphovascular invasion, particularly in stages III and IV (hazard ratio = 2.974, P < 0.001). The knockdown of CIP2A reduced the proliferation and anchorage-independent colony formation of colon cancer cells. Knockdown of CIP2A decreased the resistance of the cells to 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and SN38 (an active metabolite of irinotecan). Treatment with 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and SN38 decreased CIP2A expression. CONCLUSIONS: CIP2A is a prognostic factor in colon cancer. The knockdown of CIP2A reduced proliferation and anchorage-independent colony formation and increased 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and SN38 efficacy in colon cancer cell lines.
