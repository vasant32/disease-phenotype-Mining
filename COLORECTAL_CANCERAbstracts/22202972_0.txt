 PURPOSES: The inflammatory response after surgery is associated with various postoperative complications. The aim of the present prospective study was to evaluate the effects of Daikenchuto (DKT) (a Japanese herbal medicine) on the inflammatory response in patients following laparoscopic colorectal resection. METHODS: Thirty patients who underwent laparoscopic colectomy for colorectal carcinoma were divided into two groups: a DKT intake group (D group, n = 15) and a control group (C group, n = 15). The D group took 7.5 g/day of DKT from the day after surgery until the 7th postoperative day. The body temperature, heart rate, WBC count, lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, β-D: -glucan level and Candida index were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The patients' mean age in the D group was significantly younger than that in the C group. D3 lymph node dissection was performed more often in the D group. The time until first flatus was significantly shorter in the D group (1.8 ± 0.5 days) than in the C group (2.7 ± 0.5 days). The CRP level was significantly lower in the D group (4.6 ± 0.6 mg/dl) than in the C group (8.3 ± 1.1 mg/dl) on the 3rd postoperative day. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative DKT administration significantly suppressed the CRP level and shortened the time until first flatus. DKT administration also significantly suppressed postoperative inflammation following surgery for colorectal cancer.
