A 60-year-old woman underwent emergency operation for ileus due to rectosigmoid cancer. Intraoperative cytology and peritoneal dissemination were positive. After performing sigmoid colostomy, she underwent neoadjuvant radiation therapy (40 Gy)and eight courses of a XELOX and bevacizumab regimen. FDG-PET did not indicate FDG accumulation after chemoradiotherapy, thus, we performed low anterior resection. Peritoneal dissemination and washing cytology were negative in the second operation. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with XELOX and bevacizumab were useful for down staging in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.
