Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Recently, much evidence has suggested that bevacizumab-induced hypertension might be predictive of the effect of bevacizumab. The aim of our study is to retrospectively assess the relationship between the onset of hypertension and the activity of bevacizumab in Japanese metastatic colorectal cancer patients. Between July 2007 and December 2010, 36 patients (median age 66 years; 36-81 years) with metastatic colorectal cancer were assigned to receive bevacizumab in combination with either mFOLFOX6 (5-FU, levofolinate and oxaliplatin) or FOLFIRI (5-FU, levofolinate and irinotecan) at the Tokushima University Hospital. A patient who had increase by >20 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure or had increase to >150/100 mmHg or received antihypertensive treatment was defined as hypertensive. The objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and progression-free survival (PFS) were compared between the hypertensive group (n=10) and non-hypertensive group (n=26). ORR and DCR were 60.0% and 100%, respectively, in the hypertensive group and ORR and DCR were 23.1% and 80.8%, respectively, in the non-hypertensive group. These differences were statistically significant (p<0.05). The median PFS tended to be longer in the hypertensive group (65.0 weeks) than in the non-hypertensive group (40.0 weeks). Our data suggested that bevacizumab-induced hypertension may be predictive of the effect of bevacizumab in Japanese metastatic colorectal cancer patients.
