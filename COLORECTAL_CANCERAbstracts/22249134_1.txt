The guidance cue netrin-1 acting on mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) neurons through its receptor DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) has been implicated in the neuronal plasticity induced by psychostimulant drugs. We examined in C57/BL6 mice the effects of repeated juvenile methylphenidate (MPH) exposure on cocaine-reward sensitivity in adulthood and determined whether early MPH treatment alters adult expression of DCC in mesocorticolimbic DA regions. By using place conditioning, we show that adult mice exposed to MPH during the juvenile period are less sensitive to cocaine-reward compared to saline-controls. Furthermore, by means of immunoblotting, we demonstrate that early MPH treatment attenuates adult DCC expression in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) selectively. These results support previous evidence that developmental MPH treatment diminishes cocaine-reward in adulthood and are the first to suggest that DCC in the VTA may participate in this enduring effect.
