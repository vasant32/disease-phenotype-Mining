 PURPOSE: This multicenter phase II study was designed to determine the efficacy and tolerability of oxaliplatin, levoforinate, and infusional 5-fluorouracil (FOLFOX4) as a second-line therapy for Japanese patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer. METHODS: A total of 53 patients with progressive disease after first-line chemotherapy were enrolled in the study. The treatment was repeated every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred, or the patient chose to discontinue the treatment. RESULTS: Four patients were ineligible and one did not receive the protocol therapy. Therefore, the response rate, overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated in 48 patients; toxicity was evaluated in 52 patients, excluding the patient who had not received the protocol therapy. A partial response was observed in 10 patients. The overall response rate was 20.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.5%-35.0%). The median PFS was 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.1-7.0 months) and the median OS was 19.6 months (95% CI, 11.4-24.3 months). The most frequently encountered grade 3/4 hematological symptom was neutropenia (43.1%). The toxicity profile was generally predictable and manageable. CONCLUSION: The results showed good tolerability and efficacy for second-line FOLFOX4 in patients with advanced colorectal cancer, thus indicating the promise of this regimen as an effective second-line therapy for advanced colorectal cancer in the Japanese population.
