 PURPOSE: Methods for predicting individual responsiveness to targeted chemotherapy are urgently needed, considering the frequent resistance and extremely high cost. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A chemosensitive single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery schema is presented that utilizes (i) genome-wide SNP screening with a human SNP array and an in vitro chemosensitivity assay in 118 colorectal cancers, (ii) clinical association analysis in the other 98 patients who had received chemotherapy for metastatic cancer, and (iii) biological utility assessment using cell viability assays of transfected colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. RESULTS: Nine SNPs related to bevacizumab and cetuximab regimen sensitivity were chosen during screening. Overall responses for bevacizumab regimens revealed that patients carrying the TT genotype at ANXA11 rs1049550 or at least one G allele at LINS1 rs11247226 seemed greater chemosensitive than those carrying at least one C allele or the AA genotype, respectively (P < 0.05). For cetuximab regimens, patients carrying the GG genotype at DFNB31 rs2274159 or LIFR rs3729740 seemed greater chemosensitive than those carrying at least one A allele (P = 0.025 and P = 0.07). Cytotoxicity analyses showed that all RKO and HCT116 CRC clones transfected with the G allele at LIFR rs3729740 and the C allele at ISX rs361863 were more sensitive to cetuximab regimens than those with the A and T allele, respectively (P â‰¤ 0.001-0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Chemosensitive SNP markers were identified using a novel three-step process. The candidate marker LIFR rs3729740 and possibly ISX rs361863 will hopefully predict responsive patients to cetuximab regimens, although further validation is needed in large cohorts.
