The X-linked deubiquitinase USP9X affects the stability and activity of numerous regulatory proteins that influence cell survival. Recent studies suggest that decreased USP9X expression can confer a selective advantage onto developing cancer cells and thereby promotes disease progression. To examine the effect of USP9X on the cellular responses to anticancer therapies, we derived cancer cell lines in which the USP9X locus was disrupted by homologous recombination. The resulting USP9X-deficient cancer cells exhibited increased activation of apoptotic pathways and markedly decreased clonogenic survival in response to 5-fluorouracil, a chemotherapeutic drug that is widely used for treatment of gastrointestinal malignancies. These unexpected results suggest that cancers with low USP9X expression might be specifically sensitized to some conventional therapeutic agents.
