 BACKGROUND: Patients with colorectal cancer who seek to improve their knowledge of health and treatment options can now access in a few seconds data that would previously have required hours of research. Our aim was to evaluate the attitudes of patients toward Web browsing for information on colorectal cancer. METHODS: We surveyed all patients attending a colorectal cancer follow-up clinic between January and August 2007 on their use of the Internet to obtain information on colorectal cancer. RESULTS: In all, 439 patients with mean age of 68.6 years participated in the study. Of these, 24% reported using the Internet to obtain colorectal cancer information. Most participants used the Google search engine. Only 13% of participants confirmed that colorectal cancer information on the Internet was helpful in decision-making. Patients under the age of 65 years were more likely to have Internet access (p < 0.001), more likely to use the Internet to find colorectal cancer information (p = 0.005) and more likely to access a site recommended by a colorectal specialist (p = 0.002). Among Internet users, men were slightly more likely than women to use the Internet, although the difference was not significant (p = 0.20). CONCLUSION: The Internet is a useful tool for disseminating information about colorectal cancer. The best sites are still difficult for patients to distinguish from the thousands of sites returned by search engines. This study demonstrates that the level of potential interest is sufficient to justify the development of a departmental or regional colorectal cancer network of websites and indicates areas of interest for patients.
