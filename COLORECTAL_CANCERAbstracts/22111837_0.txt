 OBJECTIVES: To estimate the direct medical cost of colorectal neoplasia (CRN) from newly diagnosed to the completion of the tumour-specific treatment in the initial year of disease across stages and tumour primary sites. METHODS: Only direct medical costs from the perspective of the health care service provider were incorporated in the cost analysis (in 2009 USD) using a bottom-up approach. Tumour-specific treatments of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy data in the initial year of disease were identified from the 401 CRN adult patients by a review of their medical records. Service utilization for diagnosis, staging, pre-operative assessment and post-operative follow-up consultations was estimated from the recommendations of established surveillance and clinical practice guidelines. RESULTS: Direct medical cost for the care of a newly diagnosed CRN was ranging from $1941 for low-risk polyp to $45 115 for stage IV colorectal cancer in the initial year of care. Costs of care showed a gradient increase from $1748 for low-risk colonic polyps to $42 899 for stage IV colon cancer, and from $2232 for low-risk rectal polyps to $48 453 for stage IV rectal cancers. Diagnostic/pre-operative assessment and treatment accounted for most of total costs of colorectal polyp (58.9-76.7%) and cancer (60.8-85.2%) care. CONCLUSION: The results provided stage and site-specific estimations of the direct medical costs of CRN in a Chinese population that can assist policy decision making and facilitate health care service planning and cost-effectiveness evaluations.
