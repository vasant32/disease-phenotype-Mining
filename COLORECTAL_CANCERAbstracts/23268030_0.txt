The FOLFOX regimen is approved as an adjuvant therapy for colon cancer in Japan. We report a case of pathological damage in the resected non-cancerous liver after 12 courses of mFOLFOX6 therapy as an adjuvant therapy for stage IIIb colon cancer. A 45-year-old man underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for ascending colon cancer. After completing 12 courses of adjuvant mFOLFOX6 therapy, this patient exhibited liver metastasis. Lateral segment resection was performed, and pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed irregular sinusoidal dilatation and cell apoptosis in the non-tumorous part of the liver. This was probably due to the effects of mFOLFOX6. We stress that when resectable liver metastasis is found after 12 courses of FOLFOX as an adjuvant therapy for colon cancer, careful attention should be paid during surgery and during postsurgical management because there may be damage in the remnant liver.
