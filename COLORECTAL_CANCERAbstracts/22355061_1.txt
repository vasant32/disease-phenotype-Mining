 PURPOSE: Lymph node (LN) involvement is the most important prognostic factor in colorectal cancer (CRC), and pN-positive status identifies patients who require adjuvant chemotherapy. Approximately 15% to 20% of patients without nodal metastases (pN0) develop recurrent disease. In this study, we tested the prognostic significance of isolated tumor cells (ITCs) in LNs of patients with pN0 CRC (stages I and II). PATIENTS AND METHODS: ITCs in LNs regional to CRC were assessed in 312 consecutive patients with pN0 CRC who were followed up clinically and/or endoscopically for at least 6 months after surgery (mean, 67 months; median, 64 months; range, 8 to 102 months). LNs were dissected from gross surgical specimens according to a standardized protocol (with a mean of 17 LNs per patient; range, five to 107 LNs). In all, 5,313 pN0 LNs were collected and assessed by using cytokeratin immunostaining in two serial histology sections from each LN, which amounting to a total of 10,626 specimens. The correlation between ITC status and cancer recurrence was tested by using univariate and multivariate statistics. RESULTS: ITCs were documented in 185 of 312 patients (59%). CRC relapsed in 31 of 312 patients (10%), and 25 of 31 recurrences (81%) were documented among ITC-positive patients. CRC recurrence rates among ITC-positive and ITC-negative patients were 14% (25 of 185 patients) and 4.7% (six of 127 patients), respectively. In both univariate and multivariate analyses, ITC status was the only variable significantly associated with cancer relapse (Cox model; hazard ratio, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.23 to 7.32; P = .013). CONCLUSION: In patients with pN0 CRC, cancer relapse was significantly associated with ITCs in regional LNs. ITCs should be considered among the clinicobiologic variables that identify high-risk patients who can benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.
