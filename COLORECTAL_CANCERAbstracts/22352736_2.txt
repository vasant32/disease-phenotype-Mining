Metabolism of chemical carcinogens, including their activation and detoxification, plays a key role in carcinogenesis. Microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EPHX1) has an important role in the metabolism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and detoxification of procarcinogens. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between colorectal cancer (CRC) development and EPHX1 gene polymorphisms. We investigated the polymorphisms in exon 3 (T>C, Tyr113His) and exon 4 (A>G, His139Arg) of the EPHX1 gene in 68 CRC patients and 116 controls by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The frequencies of the Try113Try, Try113His, and His113His for EPHX1 exon 3 were 37.9%, 55.2%, and 6.9% in controls and 39.7%, 42.6%, and 17.6% in CRC patients, respectively. Frequencies of EPHX1 exon 4 genotypes were 62.1% His139His, 37.9% His139Arg, and 0% Arg139Arg in the control group and 76.5% His139His, 22.1% His139Arg, and 1.5% Arg139Arg in the patient group. Individuals carrying the EPHX1 exon 3 His113His genotype had a 2.5-fold increased risk (p=0.024), and those carrying the EPHX1 exon 4 His139Arg genotype had decreased risk of CRC compared with controls (p=0.019). Even though exon 3 Tyr113His and exon 4 His139Arg polymorphisms for EPHX1 gene appear to be important factors for CRC risk, further investigations with larger study groups are needed to fully elucidate the role of these polymorphisms in the development of CRC.
