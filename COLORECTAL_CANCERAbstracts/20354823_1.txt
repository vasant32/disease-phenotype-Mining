The efficacy and safety of generic and brand name levofolinate injectable drugs were evaluated in 42 chemotherapy-na√Øve patients with colorectal cancer who received the combination chemotherapy of levofolinate, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin with or without bevacizumab. The tumor response rate was similar between generic drug group and brand drug group, in which the efficacy rate (complete response plus partial response) was 50% for generic drug group and 42% for brand name drug (odds ratio: 1.400, 95% confidence intervals: 0.409-4.788, P = 0.756). The rates of the decrease in plasma tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 were not different between the two groups. The incidence of adverse drug reactions was not significantly different between the two groups, although the incidence rates of adverse events associated predominantly with 5-fluorouracil such as hand-and-foot syndrome, diarrhea, and oral mucositis were rather higher, though not significantly, in generic drug group than in brand drug group (16 vs. 4% for hand-and-foot syndrome; 33 vs. 25% for diarrhea; 33 vs. 25% for oral mucositis). These findings suggest that both the effectiveness and safety profiles of the generic name levofolinate are comparable to those of the brand name drug, when used in combination with 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin in patients with colorectal cancer.
