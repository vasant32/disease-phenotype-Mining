 BACKGROUND: An increased mortality has been reported in patients with Crohn's disease (CD), while figures have remained similar or decreased in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) compared to the population in general. We evaluated the long-term mortality risk of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in a well-defined population. METHODS: The data were based on a prospective IBD register in our catchment area; follow-up covered 1986-2007. The population based cohort comprised 1915 adult patients, 1254 with UC, 550 with CD, and 111 with inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (IBDU). The mortality rate and causes of death were obtained from Statistics Finland. RESULTS: We recorded 223 deaths among the 1915 patients with IBD within a follow-up of 29,644 person-years. The standardised mortality rate (SMR) was 1.14 in CD and 0.90 in UC. In cause-specific mortality; the risk of death in diseases of the digestive system was significantly increased in CD (SMR 5.38). The mortality in colorectal cancer was non-significantly increased in both UC and CD (SMR 1.80 and 1.88, respectively). Compared to the background population, there were significantly fewer deaths due to mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (0 observed, 10.2 expected in IBD). CONCLUSIONS: The overall mortality in CD and CU was not different from that in the population. In cause-specific mortality, diseases of the digestive system were significantly increased. Deaths due to mental and behavioural disorders resulting from alcohol consumption were less common in patients with IBD than in the population at large in Finland.
