Since metastasis is one of the most important prognostic factors in colorectal cancer, development of new methods to diagnose and prevent metastasis is highly desirable. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the metastatic phenotype have not been well elucidated. In this study, a proteomics-based search was carried out for metastasis-related proteins in colorectal cancer by analyzing the differential expression of proteins in primary versus metastasis focus-derived colorectal tumor cells. Protein expression profiles were determined using a tissue microarray (TMA), and the results identified Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor alpha (Rho GDI) as a metastasis-related protein in colon and prostate cancer patients. Consequently, Rho GDI may be useful as a diagnostic biomarker and/or a therapeutic to prevent colon and prostate cancer metastasis.
