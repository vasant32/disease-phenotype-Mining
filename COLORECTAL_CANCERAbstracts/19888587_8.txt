 PURPOSE: In this study, we have examined the correlation between colorectal cancer (CRC) and serum adiponectin and resistin levels, body mass index and insulin resistance. METHODS: The relation between serum adiponectin and resistin levels, obesity and insulin resistance in 36 CRC patients and 37 controls was examined. RESULTS: Insulin and homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) levels were higher, and adiponectin levels were significantly decreased in patients versus controls, whereas, resistin levels were significantly increased. A negative correlation between adiponectin, HOMA-IR, and insulin and a positive correlation between HOMA-IR, insulin, and stage were detected. There was no correlation between the stage and resistin. Adiponectin level negatively correlated with the stage. Adiponectin and resistin could play a role in colon cancer carcinogenesis, and adiponectin could be responsible for poor prognosis in colorectal cancer.
