Background. Colonoscopy for screening the population at an average risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) is recommended by many leading gastrointestinal associations. Objectives. The objective was to assess the quality, complications and acceptance rate of colonoscopy by patients. Methods. We prospectively gathered data from colonoscopies which were performed between October 2003 and September 2006. Patients were asked to return a follow-up form seven days after the procedure. Those who failed to do so were contacted by phone. Results. 6584 patients were included (50.4% males). The average age of subjects was 57.73 (SD 15.22). CRC screening was the main indication in 12.8%. Cecal intubation was achieved in 92% of patients and bowel preparation was good to excellent in 76.2%. The immediate outcome after colonoscopy was good in 99.4%. Perforations occurred in 3 cases-1 in every 2200 colonoscopies. Significant bleeding occurred in 3 cases (treated conservatively). 94.2% of patients agreed to undergo repeat colonoscopy in the future if indicated. Conclusions. The good quality of examinations, coupled with the low risk for complications and the good acceptance by the patients, encourages us to recommend colonoscopy as a primary screening test for CRC in Israel.
