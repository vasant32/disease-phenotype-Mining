Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is highly expressed in colorectal             carcinomas and, as a result, it leads to the activation of downstream mammalian             target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase pathways for cancer growth and progression.             Clinical and preclinical studies, however, have shown that inhibition of epidermal             growth factor receptor (EGFR) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) alone is             not sufficient to treat colorectal carcinomas. In search of effective combination             therapies, we show here that simultaneous targeting of EGFR with its inhibitor,             erlotinib and mTOR with its inhibitor, rapamycin inhibits the phosphorylation             and activation of downstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, mTOR and             extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) pathways, resulting in the             inhibition of cell cycle progression and the growth of both KRAS wild-type and             mutated colorectal carcinoma cells. This study has demonstrated the principle             that the combination of erlotinib and rapamycin may provide an effective therapy             for colorectal carcinomas.
