Patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) experience psychological stress due to the diagnosis and the physical and social changes brought on by the illness, increasing the risk of depressive disorder. Depression causes tremendous disability and adds to the suffering that patients must already endure. It is known to alter immune and endocrine functions that affect vulnerability to CRC, its course over time, and its response to treatment. We review the prevalence of depressive symptoms and disorders worldwide and in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), focusing on patients with medical illness and those with CRC, in particular. We examine how often depression is diagnosed, how it is treated, and its likely course over time, and review the effects of depression on functional disability, longevity, and immune functions. Finally, we discuss research needs and make recommendations on highest priority research studies to advance our understanding of depressive disorder in CRC patients in KSA.
