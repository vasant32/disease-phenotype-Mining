 AIM: To correlate cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression profile with clinical and pathological variables to assess their prognostic/predictive value in colorectal carcinoma (CRC). METHODS: Archival tumor samples were analyzed using immunohistochemistry for COX-2 expression in 94 patients with CRC. Patients were diagnosed and treated at the Departments of Surgery and Oncology, King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: Fifty-six percent of the tumors showed positive cytoplasmic COX-2 expression, whereas 44% of cases were completely COX-2-negative. There were no significant correlations between COX-2 expression and sex, age, grade or tumor location. However, COX-2 expression revealed a significant correlation with tumor stage (P = 0.01) and distant metastasis (P = 0.02), and a borderline association with lymph node involvement (P = 0.07). Tumors with high COX-2 expression showed a higher recurrence rate than tumors with no expression (P < 0.009). In univariate Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, there was a significant (P = 0.026) difference in disease-free survival between COX-2-positive and negative tumors in favor of the latter. COX-2 expression did not significantly predict disease-specific survival, which was much shorter for COX-2-positive tumors. In multivariate (COX) models, COX-2 did not appear among the independent predictors of disease-free survival or disease-specific survival. CONCLUSION: COX-2 expression seems to provide useful prognostic information in CRC, while predicting the patients at high risk for recurrent disease.
