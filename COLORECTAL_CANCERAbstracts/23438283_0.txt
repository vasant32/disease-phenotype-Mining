Abstract   The needleless closed system (NCS) has been disseminated in several clinical fields to prevent central venous catheter-related bloodstream infection (CVC-RBSI), in place of the conventional Luer cap system (LCS). The purpose of this study is to examine whether NCS is really superior to conventional LCS for prevention of CVC-RBSI. Between May 2002 and December 2008, 1767 patients received CVC in our department. The time interval from insertion to development of CVC-RBSI was compared retrospectively between selected patients who were treated using the conventional LCS (group 1, n = 89, before June 2006) and the NCS (group 2, n = 406, June 2006 and after). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed no significant difference in the time interval from insertion to development of CVC-RBSI between the two groups. NCS does not reduce CVC-RBSI in adult colorectal cancer patients who undergo CVC insertion.
