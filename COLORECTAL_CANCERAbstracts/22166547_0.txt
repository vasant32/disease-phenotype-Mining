 UNLABELLED: There is always a certain rate of recurrence after radical treatment for cancer and to get on it an early detection of disease set back is crucial. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Medical data of patients operated on for primarily detected colorectal cancer in years 1993-2002 was retrospectively reviewed. Usefulness of follow-up means such as physical examination, or CEA and endoscopic surveillance was analyzed. All mentioned above were applied to scheduled follow-up (in 3, 6 and 12 month intervals following an operation and annually after that by the year 5). RESULTS: Complete and reliable data was obtained from 340 out of 502 follow-up intended subjects (67.7%). Elevated CEA was the most frequent predictor of recurrence within non-symptomatic subjects meeting follow-up appointments (60%). The cancer set back diagnosed by means of either physical or endoscopic examinations was the case only in one out of five patients (20.75% and 18.87% respectively). Clinical onset of recurrence making patients meet an unscheduled appointment was found increasing relative risk of nothing-but-palliative option either for them with local set back, or meta-static spread. Relative risk of onset of meta-chronous colonic cancer was significantly higher in patients being affected by synchronous advanced adenoma at time of surgery compared to those with one-fold changes. CONCLUSIONS: CEA scheduled follow-up after treatment for colorectal cancer CRC seems adequate to provide a good outcome of treatment for recurrent tumors. CRC patients presenting with synchronous advanced adenomas at time of surgery are probably to be under more intensive endoscopic surveillance.
