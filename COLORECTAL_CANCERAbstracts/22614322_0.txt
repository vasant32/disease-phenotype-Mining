The main cause of death for colorectal cancer (CRC) patients is the development             of metastatic lesions at sites distant from the primary tumor. Therefore, it is             important to find biomarkers that are related to the metastasis and to study the             possible mechanisms. Recent data have shown that soluble attractant molecules             called chemokines support the metastasis of certain cancers to certain organs.             To identify molecular regulators that are differentially expressed in liver metastasis             of CRC, PCR array analysis was performed and CC chemokine ligand 7 (CCL7) showed             remarkable overexpression in liver metastatic tumor tissues. To validate the results             of the PCR array, 30 patients with primary CRC and liver metastases were selected.             Immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR analysis showed that CCL7 was expressed             in normal colonic epithelium and the expression was higher in liver metastases             compared to primary CRC (p<0.001). Real-time PCR showed that the expression             of CCR1, CCR2 and CCR3 was also higher in liver metastases compared to primary             CRC (p=0.001, p=0.033 and p<0.001, respectively). In conclusion, correlation             of CCL7 overexpression and its receptor expression with colon cancer liver metastasis             suggests that CCL7 as a novel target in liver metastasis of CRC may be of potential             clinical value for the prevention of hepatic recurrences.
