To date, there was no controlled-study regarding awareness and knowledge of colorectal cancer in the Turkish population. We therefore designed a questionnaire consisting of items related to socio-demographic parameters, medical and family history and questions of awareness and knowledge about colorectal cancer for use in a descriptive cross-sectional study. An interviewer-administered technique was applied and 450 subjects were interviewed in the outpatient clinics at Near East University Hospital. Among all subjects, 337 were found to be eligible for the study group. Exclusion criteria were age below 18 years, any cancer history, family history of colorectal cancer, current colorectal problems, history of any diagnostic or therapeutic interventions for colorectal diseases.All participants stated that they heard about colorectal cancer. When asked about the lifetime risk of colorectal carcinoma, only 25.4% of women and 37.9% of men estimated correctly. Univariate analysis revealed that the total awareness score was significantly correlated with age, marital status, parenthood and fecal occult blood testing history. On multivariate analysis of independent predictors for awareness of colorectal cancer were found to be history of fecal occult blood testing, age and marital status were found to be the most important determinants. As a conclusion, opportunistic screening with fecal occult blood test by physicians from non-gastrointestinal specialties not only helps to reduce the mortality but also increases the awareness of colorectal cancer.
