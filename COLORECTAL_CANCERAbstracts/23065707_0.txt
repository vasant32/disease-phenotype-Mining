 PURPOSE: Defects in DNA repair pathways have been linked with colorectal cancer (CRC). Adjuvant radiotherapy has become commonplace in the treatment of rectal cancer however it is associated with a higher rate of second cancer formation. It is known that radiation results in DNA damage directly or indirectly by radiation-induced bystander effect (RIBE) by causing double-strand breaks (DSBs). The majority of work in RIBE has been performed in cell lines and limited studies have been in or ex vivo. METHODS: The first study aim was to examine by immunohistochemistry, levels of DSB (expression of the protein MRE11) in normal colonic tissue outside the irradiated field post neo-adjuvant radiotherapy (group 1). These levels were compared to (a) irradiated tumour tissue post neo-adjuvant radiation within the same group, (b) a CRC patient group (group 2) who had not undergone neo-adjuvant radiotherapy and (c) a non-cancer patient group (group 3). The second aim was to determine if MRE11 expression levels were related to survival or radio-sensitivity post neo-adjuvant radiotherapy. RESULTS: There was a highly significant increase in MRE 11 expression in group 1 versus groups 2 and 3 (p < 0.001). There was no association between MRE11 levels and survival or radio-sensitivity. CONCLUSION: Our findings show radiotherapy causes DSBs at significantly higher levels in normal colonic mucosa of patients post neo-adjuvant treatment which may represent RIBE. If this damage remains unrepaired, increased levels of genomic instability may contribute to the higher occurrence of second cancers in patients treated post neo-adjuvant radiotherapy.
