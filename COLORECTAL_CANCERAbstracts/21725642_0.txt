According to "fluid-mosaic model," plasma membrane is a bilayer constituted by phospholipids which regulates the various cellular activities governed by many proteins and enzymes. Any chemical, biochemical, or physical factor has to interact with the bilayer in order to regulate the cellular metabolism where various physicochemical properties of membrane, i.e., polarization, fluidity, electrostatic potential, and phase state may get affected. In this study, we have observed the in vivo effects of a pro-carcinogen 1,2-dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (DMH) and the two non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); sulindac and celecoxib on various properties of the plasma membrane of colonocytes, i.e., electric potential, fluidity, anisotropy, microviscosity, lateral diffusion, and phase state in the experimentally induced colorectal cancer. A number of fluorescence probes were utilized like membrane fluidity and anisotropy by 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, membrane microviscosity by Pyrene, membrane electric potential by merocyanine 540, lateral diffusion by N-NBD-PE, and phase state by Laurdan. It is observed that membrane phospholipids are less densely packed and therefore, the membrane is more fluid in case of carcinogenesis produced by DMH than control. But NSAIDs are effective in reverting back the membrane toward normal state when co-administered with DMH. The membrane becomes less fluid, composed of low electric potential phospholipids whose lateral diffusion is being prohibited and the membrane stays mostly in relative gel phase. It may be stated that sulindac and celecoxib, the two NSAIDs may exert their anti-neoplastic role in colorectal cancer via modifying the physicochemical properties of the membranes.
