 OBJECTIVE: CDw75 is an Î±(2,6)-sialylated antigen associated with a poor prognosis in gastric cancer. In the present study, we examined if CDw75 expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) predicts tumour recurrence. Besides, we evaluated CDw75 expression in different colorectal tissue specimens to clarify their role in tumour development and progression. METHODS: We analyzed CDw75 expression in 34 specimens of healthy disease-free colorectal mucosa, 19 specimens of inflammatory colorectal mucosa, 73 colorectal adenomas, 35 specimens of healthy tissue and 101 specimens of tumoural tissue from CRC patients. RESULTS: None of the healthy disease-free and inflammatory colorectal mucosa specimens showed the presence of the epitope. CDw75 was expressed in 26% of the colorectal adenomas. In healthy and tumoural tissue from CRC patients, CDw75 was detected in 22.9% and 82.2% of the specimens, respectively. CDw75 expression in tumoural tissue was correlated with growth pattern (p = 0.044), Dukes stage (p = 0.002), TNM stage (p = 0.020) and distant metastasis (p = 0.005). Survival analysis showed that CDw75 expression is not associated with tumour recurrence. CONCLUSION: CDw75 expression in CRC is not a prognostic factor for predicting disease-free survival. Nevertheless, CDw75 expression may be a good marker of tumour progression and of the malignant potential of CRC.
