Limitation on two dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis technique causes some proteins to be under presented, especially the extreme acidic, basic, or membrane proteins. To overcome the limitation of 2D electrophoresis, an analysis method was developed for identification of differentially expressed proteins in normal and cancerous colonic tissues using self-pack hydroxyapatite (HA) column. Normal and cancerous colon tissues were homogenized and proteins were extracted using sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.8. Protein concentration was determined and the proteins were loaded unto the HA column. HA column reduced the complexity of proteins mixture by fractionating the proteins according to their ionic strength. Further protein separation was accomplished by a simple and cost effective sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis method. The protein bands were subjected to in-gel digestion and protein analysis was performed using electrospray ionization (ESI) ion trap mass spectrometer. There were 17 upregulated proteins and seven downregulated proteins detected with significant differential expression. Some of these proteins were low abundant proteins or proteins with extreme pH that were usually under presented in 2D gel analysis. We have identified brain mitochondrial carrier protein 1, T-cell surface glycoprotein CD1a, SOSS complex subunit B2, and Protein Jade 1 which were previously not detected in 2D gel analysis method.
