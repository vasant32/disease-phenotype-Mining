The aim of this study was to elucidate the significance of a novel staging criterion, a five-point scoring system (FPSS), determined by five histopathological factors of colorectal carcinoma. These factors included depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion and histopathological tumor type. In total, 357 patients with colorectal carcinoma who had had been treated by surgical resection were investigated. One point was assigned to each of the five aforementioned tumor-related pathological factors. The FPSS score was determined by an aggregate of the points. A significant difference was observed between the survival of patients with FPSS scores of 0 and 1, and 2 and 3 (P=0.0002); and FPSS scores of 2 and 3, and 4 and 5 (P<0.0001). We demonstrate that the FPSS is a convenient criterion for stratifying the prognosis of patients with colorectal carcinoma.
