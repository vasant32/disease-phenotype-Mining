 OBJECTIVES: Early detection and screening for colorectal cancer is important among first degree relatives (FDR) of colon cancer cases. METHODS: Our target population comprised all such FDR, above 40 years of age, registered during the years 2003-2007, Jordan. Detailed information about cancer cases was collected from Jordan Cancer Registry. The screening study was conducted through two stages, where all FDR were examined at their homes for any suggestive related symptoms of colorectal cancer, then those who were suspected to have cancer were referred to hospital for confirmatory colonoscopy. RESULTS: First degree relatives amounted to 3,574 subjects, 153 (4.3%) were complaining of signs and/or symptoms suggestive of CRC. Of them 58 (37.9%) did not accept colonoscopy. The confirmation colonoscopy results for the remaining 95 (62.1%) indicated two confirmed CRC cases. Seventy three percent of the suspected cases complained mainly from change in bowel habit and about one fifth felt cramping. CONCLUSION: This study raised the question of cost effectiveness and cost benefits of running a nationwide screening program for such cancer in a developing country. On the other hand it highlights the importance of early detection activities in Jordan as it was the first study to be conducted among a community dwelling high risk population in the country.
