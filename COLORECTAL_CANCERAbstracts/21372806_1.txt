The aim of this study was to investigate whether there was a relationship between colorectal adenoma and metabolically obese but normal weight (MONW) among Korean men and women. The MONW phenotype is defined as a BMI <25, but fulfilling the metabolic syndrome (MS) criteria with a modified waist circumference (≥90 cm for men and ≥85 cm for women) appropriate for Korean. A total of 3,430 subjects (2,263 men and 1,167 women; 23-75 years old) were included in the study. Colorectal adenomas were diagnosed in 775 men and 199 women. The rate of advanced adenomas in males was 24.3% and in females 21.1%. A significant association between MONW and advanced colorectal adenoma was found in men (age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.92, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-3.47) but not in women (age-adjusted OR = 1.80, 95% CI: 0.50-6.45). The findings suggest that men with MONW may have an increased risk of developing advanced colorectal adenoma whereas this does not seem true for females.
