 BACKGROUND: Although hepatectomy for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) offers prolonged survival in up to 40% of people, recurrence rates are high, approaching 70%. Many patients experience recurrent disease in the liver after initial hepatectomy. We examined our experience with repeat hepatectomy for mCRC. METHODS: After Institutional Review Board approval, we reviewed the records of all patients at a single institution who underwent hepatectomy for mCRC. Repeat hepatectomy was defined as partial liver resection any time after the initial hepatectomy for recurrent mCRC. We estimated time to recurrence and survival by using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared outcomes between groups by using the log-rank test. RESULTS: From 1998 to 2008, 405 patients underwent hepatectomy for mCRC, and 215 (53%) experienced disease recurrence at a median of 13 months. Of 150 patients with liver-only or liver-predominant recurrence, 52 (35%) underwent repeat hepatectomy. The median time to recurrence after repeat hepatectomy was 10 months, and median overall survival was 19 months. There was one (1.9%) perioperative death, and there were 14 (27%) major complications. The median overall survival in the repeat hepatectomy group from the time of recurrence after initial hepatectomy was 22 months, compared with 15 months in the 98 patients with liver recurrence who were not selected for repeat hepatectomy (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Repeat hepatectomy for mCRC is feasible in highly selected patients, with acceptable perioperative morbidity and mortality. Although repeat hepatectomy should be considered, recurrence rates are high. Although the initial hepatectomy for mCRC is potentially curative, recurrence of metastatic disease in the liver is unlikely to be cured.
