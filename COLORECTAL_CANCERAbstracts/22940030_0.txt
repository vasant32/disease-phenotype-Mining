 BACKGROUND: In colorectal cancer patients, loop ileostomies are used to protect an anastomosis, in salvage surgery after a complication, and as a palliative measure. The aim of this study was to identify complications to the ileostomy, time until reversal, and risk factors for nonclosure or a permanent stoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Consecutive patients who received a loop ileostomy with the diagnosis of colorectal cancer at index surgery in four hospitals in Region Västra Götaland, Sweden, from January 1, 2007 until February 28, 2010 were retrospectively studied. Demography, events during index surgery, complications related to the ileostomy and technique, and complications during closure were registered. RESULTS: A total of 262 patients received a loop ileostomy. Loop iliostomies were constructed during emergency surgery in 15% of patients. Forty-three percent had complications related to the ileostomy; most common were high-volume output and leakage of stomal output. Morbidity after closure was high, at 28%, and mortality was 1%. Eighty-six percent had their stoma closed, median time 178 (3-700) d. Risk factors for nonreversal were postoperative complications to index surgery and advanced cancer disease. Eleven percent received a secondary stoma, and at the end of the study 23% had a permanent stoma. CONCLUSIONS: The morbidity related to loop ileostomies and loop ileostomy closure is considerable. One in five patients will have a permanent stoma, and our conclusion is that for emergency patients with advanced disease another type of stoma should be chosen, if possible, to reduce the morbidity.
