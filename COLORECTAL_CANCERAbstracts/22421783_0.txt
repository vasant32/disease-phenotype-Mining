A83 -year-old man was admitted to our hospital for the treatment of advanced ascending colon cancer with liver metastases. He had initially undergone an ileocecal resection for ascending colon cancer. Subsequently, we started oral administration of UFT/LV(UFT 400mg/day, LV 75 mg/day, and 4 weeks of therapy followed by a week suspension of treatment). After 3 courses, his tumors responded well to treatment, and CT showed marked regression of liver metastases. After 10 courses, liver metastases had almost disappeared. Two years passed without any adverse events since UFT/LV therapy was started. These findings suggest that UFT/LV therapy is very safe and effective for elderly patients with unresectable colorectal cancer.
