 OBJECTIVES: To investigate the expression of COX-2, MMP-2 and VEGF in colorectal cancer and the clinical/pathological significance. METHODS: Stage II and III colorectal cancer patients (149 cases) that received radical resection between May 2003 and November 2008 and who had complete clinical and pathological data, were recruited in this study. Expression of COX-2, MMP-2 and VEGF were detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The positive rate of COX-2, MMP-2, and VEGF expression was 60.4%, 50.3% and 69.1%, respectively. COX-2 correlated with stage, lymph node metastasis, postoperative recurrence and metastasis, and survival rate; MMP-2 correlated with intestinal wall invasion, stage, number of lymph node metastasis, postoperative recurrence and metastasis, and survival rate; VEGF correlated with preoperative serum levels of CEA and CA199, postoperative recurrence and metastasis, and survival rate; the positive rate of COX-2, MMP-2 and VEGF co-expression was 32.9%, which correlated with stage, number of lymph node metastasis, preoperative serum level of CEA, postoperative recurrence and metastasis, and survival rate. CONCLUSION: The expression of COX-2, MMP-2 and VEGF in colorectal cancer plays a synergistic promoting effect on the malignant biological behavior of tumors, which could be used as a marker to determine the malignant progression, invasion and metastasis, and prognosis of the tumor.
