 BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to define any benefits in terms of early outcome for laparoscopic colectomy in patients over 75 years old (OP) compared with the outcomes of a younger populations (YP). METHODS: Forty elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy for colorectal cancer between 2007-2011 were studied, the patients are divided for gender, age, year of surgery, site of cancer, and comorbidity on admission and compared with 40 younger patients. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Mean (standard deviation) age was 81.3 in OP and 68.3 YP Conversion rate was the same between the two groups. There was no difference in operative mean time . The overall mortality rate was 0% percent. The surgical morbidity rate was the same but there was an increased in cardiologic e bronchopneumonia complications in older population. Patients treated with laparoscopic approach had a faster recovery of bowel function and a significant reduction of the mean length of hospital stay not age related. Laparoscopy allowed a better preservation of postoperative independence status. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic colectomy for cancer in elderly patients is safe and beneficial including preservation of postoperative independence and a reduction of length of hospital stay.
