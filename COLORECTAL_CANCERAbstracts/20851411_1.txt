 BACKGROUND: Fascin-1 is not expressed in normal colorectal epithelium, but is up-regulated in colorectal cancer. However, its exact biological mechanism remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship of fascin-1 expression with the clinicopathologic parameters and its prognostic impact in advanced colorectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The immunohistochemical stainings for fascin-1, β-catenin, and Ki-67 labeling index were performed with 126 stage III colorectal cancer specimens. RESULTS: Fascin-1 was found to be expressed in 74 (58.7%) of the 126 colorectal cancer specimens. Five-year survival rate was significantly low, whereas the distant recurrence rate was significantly high in patients with fascin-positive stage III colorectal cancer. There was no significant correlation between fascin-1 expression and clinicopathologic factors such as tumor size, nodal metastasis, pathologic stage, β-catenin expression, and Ki-67 labeling index. However, fascin-1 expression was an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis. Patients with N1 showed no significant difference in 5-y DFS and OS according to the fascin-1 expression (79.0% versus 60.5%, P = 0.113; 86.5% versus 78.8%, P = 0.566). Patients with N2 showed marginal difference in 5-y DFS and significant difference in 5-y OS according to the fascin-1 expression (59.4% versus 32.4%, P = 0.088; 81.2% versus 39.5%, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that fascin-1 expression in colorectal cancer may be clinically useful in predicting distant metastasis and poor survival, and we demonstrated that fascin-1 expression and N stage are significant independent prognostic factors for survival of colorectal cancer patients.
