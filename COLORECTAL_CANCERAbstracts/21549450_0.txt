The Pillcam colon capsule was first introduced in 2006 for the study of the colon. Colon capsule endoscopy is a new diagnostic technology to visualize the colorectal mucosa without sedation, intubation or insufflation and appears to be a safe and attractive alternative to colonoscopy. Since the introduction of this technology, numerous studies have been published on its diagnostic sensitivity and the regimen of colon preparation for better evaluation of the colon. Recently, a new generation of the capsule, Pillcam Colon 2, has been presented, with important innovations.
