 AIM: Proponents suggest that laparoscopic colorectal resection might be achievable in up to 90% of cases, while keeping conversion rates below 10%. This unselected prospective case series reports on the proportion of patients having a completed laparoscopic colorectal resection in two units where laparoscopic colorectal practice is well established and readily available. METHOD: All patients undergoing elective and emergency colorectal resection during a 6-month period were identified. The underlying pathology and the surgical approach (laparoscopic or open) were recorded. The contraindications to laparoscopic resection were also documented. The need and rationale for conversion to an open approach were recorded. RESULTS: In total, 205 consecutive patients (160 elective and 45 emergency procedures) underwent colorectal resection for malignancy [117 (57%) patients] and benign pathology [88 (43%) patients]. Laparoscopic resection was attempted in 127/205 (62%) patients and 31/127 (24%) of these were converted to open surgery. The main reasons for not attempting laparoscopic resection were locally advanced disease and emergency surgery. The commonest reasons for conversion were advanced disease and to allow completion of rectal dissection and/or cross-stapling of the rectum. CONCLUSION: Despite a special interest in laparoscopic colorectal surgery of the two colorectal units who provided the data for this study, fewer than half (96/205; 47%) of the patients in this consecutive unselected series who were undergoing major colorectal resection had the procedure completed laparoscopically.
