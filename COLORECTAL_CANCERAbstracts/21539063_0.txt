 INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence is rapidly increasing. It has been demonstrated that it can be prevented and cured when the diagnosis is made in early stages. OBJECTIVE: For this reason it is necessary to apply a screening program in asymptomatic patients. METHOD: Since 2003, we conducted a CRC screening plan called "Mes del Colon" at Cl√≠nica Alemana Santiago. A press and local diffusion campaign was designed. Open to the community CRC talks were scheduled. An ad hoc database was designed. An informed consent was available. Patients older than 50 years and high risk patients were included. Total colonoscopy and a medical interview after the procedure were included in the plan with favorable economic conditions. RESULTS: Since 2003, 1158 patients were included The 1.8% of them were excluded because of incomplete data or because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. The 54% of patients were women. Mean age was 58.4 years old and mean body mass index 25.5 kg/m2. Polipoid lesions were seen in 45% of the patients. Six (1%) of them were adenocarcinomas, 291 (57%) adenomas (98% tubular adenomas), 189 (37%) hyperplastic polyps and 25 (5%) miscellaneous lesions. In this series, the necessary number to investigate for 1 adenoma was 3.9. CONCLUSIONS: CRC prevention campaigns are needed due to the continuous increase of the incidence in our country. The detection of precursor or early lesions that are longstanding before becoming advanced cancer allows its treatment avoiding progression.
