 BACKGROUND: Clinical observations suggested that a non negligible proportion of patients, ranging from 40% to 70%, does not seem to benefit from the use of anti-EGFR targeted antibodies even in the absence of a mutation of the K- RAS gene. The EGFR pathway activation via the Ras-Raf-MAP-kinase and the protein-serine/threonine kinase AKT could determine resistance to anti-EGFR treatment. METHODS: We tested the interaction between phosphorylated AKT and MAPK expression in colorectal tumours and corresponding metastases and global outcome in K-RAS wild type patients receiving irinotecan-cetuximab. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients with histologically proven metastatic colorectal cancer, treated with Irinotecan and Cetuximab based chemotherapy, were eligible for our analysis.In metastases pAKT correlated with RR (9% vs. 58%, p = 0.004), PFS (2.3 months vs. 9.2 months p < 0.0001) and OS (6.1 months vs. 26.7 months p < 0.0001) and pMAPK correlated with RR (10% vs. 47%, p = 0.002), PFS (2.3 months vs. 8.6 months p < 0.0001) and OS (7.8 months vs. 26 months p = 0.0004). At multivariate analysis pAKT and pMAPK in metastases were able to independently predict PFS. pAKT in metastases independently correlated with RR as well DISCUSSION: pAKT and pMAPK expression in metastases may modulate the activity of EGFR-targeted antibodies. We could speculate that in patients with pAKT and pMAPK metastases expression targeting these factors may be crucial.
