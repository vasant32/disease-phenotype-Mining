 AIM: There are few data on the factors associated with healthcare-seeking behaviour for symptoms of colorectal cancer. This study describes the determinants of failure and delay in seeking medical advice for rectal bleeding and change in bowel habit. METHOD: In total, 1592 persons (56-88 years) were randomly selected from the Hunter Community Study and mailed a questionnaire. RESULTS: In all, 18% (60/332) of respondents experiencing rectal bleeding and 20% (39/195) reporting change in bowel habit had never consulted a doctor. The rate of delay (>1 month) for each symptom was 18% and 37%. The reasons for delay included the assumption that the symptoms were not serious or that they were benign. Triggers for seeking medical advice varied. Healthcare-seeking behaviour for rectal bleeding had not significantly improved compared with a previous community-based study. CONCLUSION: The seriousness of symptoms, importance of early detection and prompt medical consultation must be articulated in health messages to at-risk persons.
