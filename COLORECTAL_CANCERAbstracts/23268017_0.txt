The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the predictive value of Köhne's index on the efficacy of FOLFIRI regimen in the treatment of unresectable liver metastasis of colorectal cancer. The subjects were 44 patients with unresectable liver metastasis from colorectal cancer treated with FOLFIRI regimen as second-line, for all of whom oxaliplatin-based regimen had previously failed. Bevacizumab was concomitantly used in 23 patients. Classification of the Köhne's index revealed high risk in 22 patients, intermediate risk in 7 patients, and low risk in 15 patients. The response rate was 13.6% in the patients with high risk(H group) and 27.3% in the patients with intermediate or low risk(non-H group)(p=0.45). The disease control rate was 50% in the H group and 68.2% in the non-H group (p=0.36). In the H group, the median progression -free survival time was 4.1 months and in the non-H group it was 7.1 months (p=0.33). Compared with the H group, the non-H group showed significantly better overall survival (10.8 months vs 23.9 months, p=0.03). None of the patients has received hepatectomy (conversion therapy). These results suggest that the predictive value of Köhne's index is limited in terms of the effect of shrinkage of liver metastases, including conversion therapy.
