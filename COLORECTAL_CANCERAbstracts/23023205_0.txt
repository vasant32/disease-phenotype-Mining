Radiofrequency, laser, microwave and cryotherapy have all been used for the ablation of lung tumours. However, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation are the most widely used technologies. RFA has been successfully applied to tumour measuring from <3 to 3.5 cm, either primary or secondary. Lung function usually recovers to pre-ablation values following an initial reduction and the complication profile is well understood.
