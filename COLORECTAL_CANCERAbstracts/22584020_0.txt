 PURPOSE: To describe the ocular effects associated with the administration of the systemic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors panitumumab and erlotinib. DESIGN: Retrospective, noncomparative interventional case series. PARTICIPANTS: Ten eyes of 5 patients in treatment with systemic EGFR inhibitors, 4 patients with erlotinib for end-stage lung carcinoma, and 1 patient with panitumumab for end-stage colorectal cancer. METHODS: Data collected from charts included gender, age at presentation, systemic disease, and clinical presentation in each eye. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographics on presentation and clinical findings. RESULTS: Multiple epithelial defects were observed in all 10 eyes, corneal melting and thinning were observed in 3 eyes of 2 patients, 2 eyes of 1 patient presented with lower lid ectropion, and 2 eyes of 2 patients presented with corneal perforation, both requiring a penetrating keratoplasty. CONCLUSIONS: Severe ocular side effects, including corneal perforation, may be associated with the use of the EGFR inhibitors panitumumab and erlotinib.
