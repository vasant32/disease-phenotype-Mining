Digestive endoscopy is currently the main diagnostic procedure for investigation of the digestive tract when a digestive disease is suspected. The use of computers and electronic medical records for the management of endoscopic data are an important key to improving endoscopy unit efficiency and productivity. This technology supports optimal program operation, monitoring and evaluation colorectal cancer screening. This article is a comprehensive survey of endoscopic electronic medical records and information systems. Computerized clinical records have the capability of identifying patients due for screening and to calculate baseline rates of colorectal cancer screening by patient characteristics and by primary care physician and practice group. This paper describes data flow in the endoscopy unit, the minimum data set of colorectal cancer and key features of endoscopic electronic medical record. In addition, the researchers state standards in different aspects, especially terminology standards and interoperability standards for image and text.
