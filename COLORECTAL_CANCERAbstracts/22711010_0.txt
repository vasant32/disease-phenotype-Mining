We read with interest the recent paper in the JoCI, entitled 'Study of the expression of Toll-Like Receptors in Different Histological Types of Colorectal Polyps and Their Relationship with Colorectal Cancer' by Eir√≥ et al. TLR7 and 9 expression is altered in CRC vs. normal control; which is proposed to be correlated with adenomacarcinoma progression. The fact that other TLRs were not observed to be differentially expressed is in contrast with published reports; which could be explained by the limitations of the employed method and disregarding the spatiotemporal variation in TLR expression pattern.
