 PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical relevance of circulating CEACAM5mRNA-positive cells in patients with operable colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: Peripheral blood was obtained from 265 patients with operable CRC before the initiation of adjuvant systemic therapy from 96 normal donors and RNA prepared from the Lovo and ARH-77 CRC and leukemic cell lines, respectively, was used as positive and negative controls. The detection of CEACAM5mRNA-positive cells was done using a real-time PCR assay. The association with known prognostic factors and the effect of CEACAM5mRNA-positive cells on patients' prognosis was investigated. RESULTS: The analytical detection limit of the method was found to correspond to 0.7 Lovo cell equivalence/5 Î¼g RNA, with a sensitivity of 1 tumor cell/10(5) normal cells and a specificity of 97%. Ninety-eight (37%) patients had detectable circulating CEACAM5mRNA-positive cells. Detection of CEACAM5mRNA-positive cells was significantly associated with higher relapse rate (P < 0.001), decreased disease-free survival (DFS; P < 0.001), higher death rate (P = 0.017), and decreased median overall survival (P = 0.025). Multivariate analysis revealed that the detection of circulating CEACAM5mRNA-positive cells was an independent prognostic factor for decreased DFS [HR = 3.4; 95% CI: 2.0-5.9; P < 0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of peripheral blood CEACAM5mRNA-positive cells is an adverse prognostic factor correlated with poor clinical outcome in patients with operable CRC.
