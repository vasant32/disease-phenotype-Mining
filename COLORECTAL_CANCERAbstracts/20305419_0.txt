Cutaneous and subcutaneous metastases of colorectal cancer is rare. The authors present a case of a 63-year-old man with colorectal carcinoma, who underwent preoperative staging with positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). PET/CT demonstrated intensely increased uptake in the subcutaneous nodular lesion in the anterior surface of the right thigh. Histopathological examination of the excised subcutaneous nodular lesion revealed adenocarcinoma metastases.
