 PURPOSE: Self-reported taste alterations are common in people receiving chemotherapy; however, it is usually unclear whether these reports refer to changes to the sense of taste itself or to problems related to the broader phenomenon of flavour, or the hedonic experience of eating and drinking. The purpose of this study was to explore patient and carer descriptions, experiences and consequences of taste and flavour changes associated with oxaliplatin treatment. METHODS: This study utilised a grounded theory research design. Purposeful sampling was used to recruit eligible patients who had self-reported taste changes in relation to oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy for colorectal cancer. Content analysis of interview data was performed using an analysis framework derived from previous sensory and nutritional sciences and supportive care research. RESULTS: Ten patients and four carers participated in semi-structured interviews. The overarching theme identified from the data was reduced food enjoyment. In addition to changes to taste, participants described sensory and hedonic changes which influence overall flavour perception and food enjoyment. Reduced food enjoyment had dietary, social and emotional consequences for patients and carers. CONCLUSIONS: 'Taste' problems during oxaliplatin treatment mostly relate to the broader phenomena of flavour. This study has helped to unravel the major sensory determinants of the eating and drinking experience in the chemotherapy setting and has provided guidance regarding relevant and measurable endpoints of chemotherapy-related flavour changes. There remains a gap in knowledge between the pattern of flavour changes associated with chemotherapy treatment and how this influences dietary intake and nutritional status.
