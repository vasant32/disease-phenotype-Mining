 BACKGROUND: Barrett's oesophagus (BO) is a premalignant condition associated with oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Although speculation exists, it is currently unclear if BO is associated with an increased risk of colonic tumours. AIM: To conduct a meta-analysis of studies reporting the prevalence of colonic tumours in patients with BO vs. controls and thus quantify the risk of colonic tumours associated with BO. METHODS: A search was conducted through Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Current Contents Connect to 7 October 2012. We calculated pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a random-effects model for the risk of all colonic tumours associated with BO, as well as for the subgroups of colorectal cancer (CRC) and benign adenomatous tumours. RESULTS: In total, 11 studies, with 2580 BO cases, met our inclusion criteria. BO was associated with an increased risk of any colonic tumours (OR: 1.96; 95% CI: 1.56-2.46). BO was associated with an increased risk of benign adenomatous tumours (OR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.20-2.39), as well as an increased risk of CRC (OR: 1.90; 95% CI: 1.35-2.67). No statistically significant heterogeneity was observed. Publication bias was not present. CONCLUSIONS: Barrett's oesophagus was associated with an increased risk of both benign adenomatous colonic tumours and colorectal cancer. Barrett's oesophagus had a stronger association with colorectal cancer than with benign colonic tumours. Further prospective cohort studies are needed to confirm the relationship.
