 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Published data on the clinical and economic impact of infusion reactions to monoclonal antibodies are limited. This study investigated oncologists' and oncology nurses' opinions about resource use associated with infusion reactions and the impact on patient management in Europe. METHODS: Eighty oncologists and nurses from Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the UK currently treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer were interviewed by telephone using a 27-item questionnaire developed for this study. RESULTS: The mean estimated number of staff (physicians and nurses) involved in managing an infusion reaction was 1.97 for a grade 1, 2.35 for a grade 2, 3.6 for a grade 3 and 5.3 for a grade 4 reaction. In respondents' experiences, most patients with grade 3 infusion reactions (73.4%) were admitted to hospital for treatment; 82.5% of those with grade 4 infusion reactions were treated in intensive care. The estimated duration of hospital treatment was 13.3 ± 29 h for a grade 3 infusion reaction, increasing to 48.1 ± 43.7 h for a grade 4 infusion reaction. CONCLUSIONS: According to respondents, management of infusion reactions led to substantial resource use, which increased with the severity of the reaction. More severe reactions also led to anxiety in patients and distress to staff.
