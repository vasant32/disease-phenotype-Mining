The impact of thymidylate synthase (TYMS), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), and serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (SHMT1) gene polymorphisms and that of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme activity, serum total homocysteine level, and estimated serum creatinine clearance on first-line 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and bevacizumab (FOLFIRI+bevacizumab) regimen efficacy in metastatic colorectal cancer patients was investigated. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Genotyping was performed for TYMS 5'UTR variable number tandem repeat, TYMS 3'UTR ins/del, MTHFR C677T, and SHMT1 C1420T polymorphisms. The DPD activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also determined. The univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that the SHMT1 1420T allele was associated with better response (P=0.025) and longer progression-free survival (PFS) (P=0.00004) and overall survival (OS) (P=0.034). Grade â‰¥2 hypertension was also an independent prognostic factor of longer progression-free survival and OS. Bevacizumab-related hypertension might be a predictive marker of treatment efficacy (P=0.0002 for OS) in the case of wild (CC) SHMT1 1420 genotypes only.
