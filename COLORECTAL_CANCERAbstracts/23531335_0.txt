Lynch syndrome (LS), an autosomal dominant inherited cancer susceptibility syndrome, also known as hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), is caused by a germline mutation in one of several DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. LS is the most common presentation of hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC), accounting for about 2-5% of all CRC cases. More recently, it is found that a similar number of endometrial cancers is also due to one of the MMR gene mutations. There has been significant progress in LS-related CRC in terms of molecular pathogenesis, risks, genetic basis, and cancer prevention. In contrast, the advance about LS-related endometrial cancer (EC) is very much limited. In this commentary, we summarize the main clinicopathologic features of LS-related EC and propose universal screening for LS in individuals with endometrial cancer.
