 BACKGROUND: Pulmonary inflammation may contribute to lung cancer etiology. The authors conducted a broad evaluation of the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in innate immunity and inflammation pathways with lung cancer risk and conducted comparisons with a lung cancer genome-wide association study (GWAS). METHODS: In total, 378 patients with lung cancer (cases) and a group of 450 controls from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial were included. A proprietary oligonucleotide pool assay was used to genotype 1429 SNPs. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated for each SNP, and P values for trend (P(trend) ) were calculated. For statistically significant SNPs (P(trend) < .05), the results were replicated with genotyped or imputed SNPs in the GWAS, and P values were adjusted for multiple testing. RESULTS: In the PLCO analysis, a significant association was observed between lung cancer and 81 SNPs located in 44 genes (P(trend) < .05). Of these 81 SNPS, there was evidence for confirmation in the GWAS for 10 SNPs. However, after adjusting for multiple comparisons, the only SNP that retained a significant association with lung cancer in the replication phase was reference SNP rs4648127 (nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer of B-cells 1 [NFKB1]) (multiple testing-adjusted P(trend) = .02). The cytosine-thymine (CT)/TT genotype of NFKB1 was associated with reduced odds of lung cancer in the PLCO study (odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-0.86) and the in the GWAS (odds ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.69-0.90). CONCLUSIONS: A significant association was observed between a variant in the NFKB1 gene and the risk of lung cancer. The current findings add to evidence implicating inflammation and immunity in lung cancer etiology.
