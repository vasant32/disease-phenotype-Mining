Colorectal cancer develops and progresses from genetic and genomic changes that occur within and transforms the growth behavior of a normal colonic cell. Molecular tools have advanced enough to allow the scientific community to probe deeper into risk alleles within a population as well as into individual patient genetic data that can ascribe such a risk. Detected genetic and genomic changes from colorectal cancer can help determine a patient's prognosis, predict response to chemotherapy, and determine the approach to care with biological therapies. Utilizing stool, blood/plasma, and tumor tissue to obtain genetic, genomic, and pharmacokinetic information contribute to a person's profile to direct specific cancer care.
