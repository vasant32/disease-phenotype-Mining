 OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the presence and severity of oxaliplatin-associated neurotoxicity in clinical practice and the clinical management of this adverse side effect. METHOD: Observational retrospective study including patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer that started an oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy regimen during 2008 at a secondary hospital. Data were obtained from an onco-haematological prescription programme at the hospital and from digital clinical histories. We compiled variables related to the clinical characteristics of the patients, antineoplastic treatment, neurotoxicity associated with oxaliplatin, and clinical management of this issue. RESULTS: Our study included a total of 64 patients. Neurotoxicity was recorded in 65.6% of cases, usually in mild or moderate forms. In approximately one third of patients who developed this adverse effect, the oxaliplatin prescription had to be modified. We observed a statistically significant relationship between cumulative oxaliplatin doses and the presence of neurological toxicity (P=.0004). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of oxaliplatin-associated neurotoxicity and its distribution based on its severity was similar to rates published in the literature. The number of patients requiring a change in the oxaliplatin prescription could justify the need for studies that assess the clinical consequences of these modifications. We believe that effective strategies for neurological protection need to be developed in order to guarantee the safety and quality of life in these patients.
