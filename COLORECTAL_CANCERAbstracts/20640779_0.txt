While patient barriers to colorectal cancer (CRC) screening have been identified, how well this knowledge is utilized during the patient-physician interaction is not fully understood. This study aims to assess among primary care physicians the degree of consensus between perceived and actual patients' CRC screening decision-making influential factors. During 2004-2006, 30 patients were interviewed to identify factors influencing screening decisions and 66 physicians were interviewed to understand what factors they thought were important to patients. The factors were categorized using the PRECEDE-PROCEED framework, and perspectives were compared. The researchers found little consensus on CRC screening decision-making influential factors between family practitioners, general internists, and patients. The recommendations to reach consensus are provided on the individual (e.g., updating the contents of a physician's screening recommendation to proactively address patients' decision-making needs) and population (e.g., providing cross-cultural training to medical students enabling them to better understand their patients) levels.
