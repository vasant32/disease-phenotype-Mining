 BACKGROUND: Up to 25% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) present with peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) as the only site of metastases. Complete cytoreductive surgery (CCRS) followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) aims for locoregional disease control and long-term survival. Oxaliplatin is effective for treating advanced CRC. This study assesses the safety and efficacy of CCRS with HIPEC with oxaliplatin for patients with PC of CRC. METHODS: A Belgian prospective multicenter registry was performed to monitor perioperative morbidity and assess mortality, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Forty-eight consecutive patients underwent CCRS (R0/1) with HIPEC (male/female ratio 17/31, median age 60 years, range 24-76 years). Median PC index was 11 (range 1-22). Median operation time was 460 (range 125-840) min, with a median blood loss of 475 (range 2-6,000) ml. Thirty-day mortality was 0%. Complication rate (any grade) was 52.1%. Anastomotic leakage occurred in 10.4% of patients, bleeding in 6.3%, and bowel perforation in 2.1%. Median hospital stay was 20 (range 5-65) days. At median follow-up of 22.7 (range 3.2-55.7) months, OS was 97.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 86.1-99.7] at 1 year and 88.7% (95% CI 73.6-95.4) at 2 years. DFS at 1 year was 65.8% (95% CI 52.3-76.2) and 45.5% (95% CI 34.3-55.9) at 2 years. Median time until recurrence was 19.8 months (95% CI 12-upper limit not defined). Only after dichotomizing PC index was a significant difference in OS found between low and high PC index. CONCLUSIONS: CCRS followed by HIPEC with oxaliplatin for PC from CRC can be implemented with acceptable morbidity. Long-term DFS and OS can be achieved in selected patients.
