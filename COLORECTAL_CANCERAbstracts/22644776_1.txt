Skin toxicity is a frequent adverse event of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting agents. Occurrence of cetuximab-induced skin toxicity (Cet-ST) correlates with better treatment response and longer survival times. Molecular markers predicting Cet-ST are still missing. This investigation analyzed the value of Cet-ST for treatment efficacy in a randomized trial comparing cetuximab plus capecitabine/irinotecan to cetuximab plus capecitabine/oxaliplatin as first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Patient characteristics and molecular parameters (KRAS mutation, EGFR-FISH, EGFR-IHC and EGFR intron-1 polymorphism) of the tumour were correlated with response and Cet-ST. Cet-ST grade 0-1 was observed in 31%, grade 2-3 in 69% of patients. Outcome favoured patients with grade 2-3 Cet-ST with regard to overall response rate (62 vs. 41%), PFS (7.8 vs. 5.2 months) and overall survival (OS) (30.3 vs. 18.0 months). First-cycle rash was observed in 66% of patients and corresponded with longer survival (30.7 vs. 20.2 months, p = 0.007). Patients without Cet-ST had a poor outcome (PFS, 1.9 months; OS, 11 months). The correlation of Cet-ST with survival was specifically evident in patients with KRAS codon-12-mutated tumours assumed to be cetuximab resistant. In multivariate analysis of patient characteristics, male gender and younger age were significantly correlated with Cet-ST. Among molecular parameters, no significant correlation with Cet-ST was found. Cet-ST is an early predictor of treatment efficacy in cetuximab-treated patients. This effect of Cet-ST is independent of the KRAS mutation status, suggesting that Cet-ST rather relates to constitutional factors of the patient than alterations of the EGFR pathway in the tumour.
