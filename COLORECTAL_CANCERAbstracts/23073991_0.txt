Metastatic colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Since 1995, treatment regimens have included capecitabine, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, bevacizumab, cetuximab, panitumumab, aflibercept, and reforafenib. These medications have doubled the median survival of patients and improved the 5-year survival from less than 1% to 20%. Approximately 75% of patients stop first-line chemotherapy in clinical trials for reasons other than progressive disease and face the question of whether to consider "maintenance" chemotherapy or take a chemotherapy break. In this challenging case, Drs. DÃ­az-Rubio, Pietrantonio, and de Braud reflect on the data and offer their opinions. If each of the nearly 40,000 patients in the U.S. who face this decision chooses bevacizumab, the total cost is approximately $240 million per dose ($6,000 per infusion). The importance of this question and the cost to society are enormous.
