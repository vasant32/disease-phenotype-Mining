 PURPOSE: Cytoreductive surgery (CS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is the proper treatment for resectable peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the postoperative course and long-term outcome of repeat CS (reCS) plus repeat HIPEC (reHIPEC) in patients with recurrent disease, after primary CS plus primary HIPEC. METHODS: From 2004 to 2012 85 patients were subjected to primary CS + HIPEC. Fourteen of those patients developed recurrent PC and were subjected to reCS+reHIPEC during the same time period. Eligibility criteria included limited extent of the peritoneal disease, and interval of more than 12 months from the primary CS+HIPEC. The origins of the tumors were ovarian cancer (n=7) colorectal cancer (n=3), pseudomyxoma peritonei (n=3), and uterine sarcoma (n=1). RESULTS: At second laparotomy, mean peritoneal cancer index (PCI) was 5.3 + 2.8. Among the 14 procedures, HIPEC was used in all patients. The postoperative mortality was 0% and grade 3-4 postoperative complications occurred in 4 patients. The overall 1-, 2- and 3- year overall survival rate was 90, 40 and 30%, respectively. CONCLUSION: ReCS+reHIPEC is feasible and yields an accepted survival in highly selected patients.
