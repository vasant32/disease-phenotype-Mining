AIM: As a consequence of patients' improved survival and of cost-effectiveness requirements for new treatments, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) issues have gained increasing attention in colorectal cancer (CRC). This cross-sectional study assesses HRQoL in several health states of CRC and explores factors influencing HRQoL. METHOD: 508 Finnish CRC patients (aged 26-96; colon cancer 56%; female 47%) assessed their HRQoL using generic 15D and EQ-5D and cancer-specific EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaires. Patients were divided into five groups: primary treatment, rehabilitation, remission, metastatic disease, and palliative care. The patients' HRQoL was compared with population reference values. Multivariate modelling was used to find factors associated with HRQoL scores. RESULTS: The HRQoL of CRC patients is fairly good and comparable to that of the standardized general population except for those under palliative care. The mean 15D score of patients in the primary treatment group was 0.889 (95% CI: 0.869-0.914), in rehabilitation 0.877(0.855-0.907), in remission 0.886 (0.875-0.903), in metastatic disease 0.860 (0.844-0.878), and in palliative care 0.758 (0.716-0.808). The respective EQ-5D scores were 0.760 (0.699-0.823), 0.835 (0.777-0.881), 0.850 (0.828-0.882), 0.820 (0.783-0.858), and 0.643 (0.546-0.747). Multivariate analysis showed that fatigue, pain, age, and financial difficulties had a marked negative impact on HRQoL. CONCLUSION: CRC patients' mean HRQoL scores varied considerably depending on the HRQoL instrument used, but remained surprisingly good Up to the palliative stage. In addition to age and cancer-related symptoms, financial difficulties also had a clear negative impact on HRQoL,which needs to be taken into consideration when supporting patient HRQoL. © 2013 The Authors.
