Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prevalent cancer and fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. It has been shown that the nsSNPs variants play an important role in diseases, however it remained unclear how these variants are associated the disease. Recently, several CRC risk associated SNPs have been discovered, however rs961253 (Lys25Arg at 20p12.3) located in the proximity of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2) and fermitin family homolog 1 Fermt1 genes has been reported to be highly associated with the CRC risk. Here we provide evidence for the first time in silico biological functional and structural implications of non-synonymous (nsSNPs) CRC disease-associated variant Lys25Arg via molecular dynamic (MD) simulation. Protein structural analysis was performed with particular variant allele (A/C, Lys25Arg) and compared it with the predicted native protein structure. Our results showed that this nsSNPs will cause changes in the protein structure and as a result is associated with the disease. In addition to the native and mutant 3D structures of CRC associated risk allele protein domain (CRAPD), they were also analyzed using solvent accessibility models for further protein stability confirmation. Taken together, this study confirmed that this variant has functional effect and structural impact on the CRAPD and may important role in CRC disease progression; hence it could be a reasonable approach for studying the effect of other deleterious variants in future studies.
