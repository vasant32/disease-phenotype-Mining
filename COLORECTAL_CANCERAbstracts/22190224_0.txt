Studies investigating the association between cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) Leu432Val (432 C/G, rs1056836) polymorphism and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk report conflicting results. The aim of this study was to quantitatively summarize the evidence for such a relationship. Two investigators independently searched the Medline, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Chinese Biomedicine Databases. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for CYP1B1 polymorphism and CRC were calculated in a fixed-effects model and a random-effects model when appropriate. The pooled ORs were performed for co-dominant model (GG vs. CC, GC vs. CC), dominant model (GG + GC vs. CC), and recessive model (GG vs. GC + CC). This meta-analysis included ten case-control studies, which included 8,466 CRC cases and 9,301 controls. Overall, the variant genotypes (GG and GC) of the 432 C/G were not associated with CRC risk when compared with the wild-type CC homozygote (GG vs. CC, OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.93-1.10; GC vs. CC, OR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.90-1.04), without any between-study heterogeneity. Similarly, no associations were found in the dominant and recessive models (dominant model, OR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.92-1.05; recessive model, OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.96-1.11). Limiting the analysis to the studies within Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the results were persistent and robust. When stratifying for country, matched control and source of controls, no evidence of significant association was observed in any subgroup. No publication bias was found in the present study. No association is found between the CYP1B1 Leu432Val polymorphism and risk of CRC among Caucasians.
