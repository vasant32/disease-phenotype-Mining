The liver is the most common site for distant metastasis of colorectal carcinomas. In this protocol, a liver tumor metastasis model is prepared by performing a splenic injection of tumor cells in mice. This model can be used to study the effect of host-tumor interactions on tumor biology and therapeutic response.
