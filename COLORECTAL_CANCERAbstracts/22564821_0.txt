We used label-free quantitative proteomics with the insoluble fractions from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients to gain further insight into the utility of profiling altered protein expression as a potential biomarker for cancer. The insoluble fractions were prepared from paired tumor/normal biopsies from 13 patients diagnosed with CRC (stages I to IV). Fifty-six proteins identified in data pooled from the 13 cases were differentially expressed between the tumor and adjacent normal tissue. The connections between these proteins are involved in reciprocal networks related to tumorigenesis, cancer incidence based on genetic disorder, and skeletal and muscular disorders. To assess their potential utility as biomarkers, the relative expression levels of the proteins were validated using personal proteomics and a heat map to compare five individual CRC samples with five normal tissue samples. Further validation of a panel of proteins (KRT5, JUP, TUBB, and COL6A1) using western blotting confirmed the differential expression. These proteins gave specific network information for CRC, and yielded a panel of novel markers and potential targets for treatment. It is anticipated that the experimental approach described here will increase our understanding of the membrane environment in CRC, which may provide direction for making diagnoses and prognoses through molecular biomarker targeting.
