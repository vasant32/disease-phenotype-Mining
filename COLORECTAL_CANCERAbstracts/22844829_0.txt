 BACKGROUND: The right colon cancer (RCC) has some particularities from point of view of epidemiology, clinical aspects, therapy and prognosis. MATHERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the patients operated in the First Surgical Unit Ia≈üi during 2004 until 2009, for right colon cancer. The patients' data from the medical files were digitally encoded and included into a MS Access database, and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: 219 cases were included into the analysis, which represents 24.17% from all the patients with colorectal cancer. The median age was 66 years old. A palpable mass into the right abdominal quadrant was founded in 41.5% and anemia in 65.3%. Abdominal ultrasound exam has been performed in all the patients, with 71.3% sensitivity for primary tumor positive diagnosis. Resectability was 89.5% but without multivisceral resections. The intraoperative complication rate was 6.8%; postoperative morbidity was 19.4% with an incidence of anastomotic leak of 1.38%. The postoperative mortality rate was 2.77%. The mean overall survival was 40.13 +/- 1.93 months (median: 49.26). The prognosis factors for the survival rate were: histologic type of the tumor, stage and tumor grading, vascular and perineural invasion. The presence of metastasis in more than 3 lymphnodes as well as resection of fewer than 11 lymphnodes were found as negative prognosis factors for the survival rate. CONCLUSIONS: RCC has an increasing incidence and it is associated especially with elderly patients. The RCC resectability is about 90% with acceptable rates of morbidity and mortality. Perineural and vascular invasion as well as rate of positive lymphnodes and count of resected lymphnodes are prognosis factor for overall survival rate.
