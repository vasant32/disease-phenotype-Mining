 OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between neuropilin 2 (NRP-2) and lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis of human colorectal carcinoma (CRC), as well as the expression of NRP-2 in CRC tissues. METHODS: A total of 55 cases of CRC, adjacent and normal tissues of surgical resection were randomly selected at our hospital from March 2010 to January 2012. All pathological findings were confirmed by histopathology. The expression of NRP-2 was detected with reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and immunohistochemistry in parenchymatous and surrounding malignant tissues. Then lymphangiogenesis was marked with D2-40 monoclonal antibody and microlymphatic density (MLD) counted. RESULTS: Significant differences of MLD existed between those of tumor region (39 ± 19) and tumor margin (53 ± 26, P < 0.01). Both the number and shape of lymphangiogenesis were different between the parenchymatous and surrounding tissues. The expression of NRP-2 had a positive correlation with MLD both at the protein level (r = 0.325, P < 0.05) and at the gene level (r = 0.545, P = 0.000). And it was also correlated with the differentiation degree, infiltrative degree, lymphovascular invasion, lymph node metastasis and Dukes tumor staging (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The expression of NRP-2 may regulate lymphangiogenesis and it may play an important role in the incidence and development of CRC.
