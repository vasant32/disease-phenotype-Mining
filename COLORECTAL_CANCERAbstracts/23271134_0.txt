Several potential functional polymorphisms in the DNA repair gene X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) Arg399Gln (rs25487), Arg194Trp (rs1799782), Arg280His (rs25489) and X-ray repair cross-complementing group 3 (XRCC3) T241M (rs861539) have been implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, but the results are conflicting. Here, we performed a meta-analysis of 23 published case control datasets and assessed genetic heterogeneity between those datasets. All the case-control studies published from January 2000 to June 2012 on the association between those polymorphisms and CRC risk were identified by searching the electronic literature Medline. Statistical analysis was performed with the software programs Review Manager (version 4.2). For overall CRC, no significant association was observed, the pooled odds ratios for XRCC1 Arg399Gln, Arg194Trp, Arg280His, and XRCC3 T241M were 1.02 (95 % CI: 0.93, 1.12), 1.03 (95 % CI: 0.94, 1.14), 0.98 (95 % CI: 0.85, 1.13) and 1.03 (95 % CI: 0.85, 1.26), respectively. Furthermore, no significant association was observed in subgroup analyses based on ethnicity. The results suggested that these four SNPs evaluated are not associated with risk of CRC.
