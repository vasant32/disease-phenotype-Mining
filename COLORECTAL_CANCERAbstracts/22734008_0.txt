 BACKGROUND: A range of treatments are available for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). An initial period without active treatment, a 'watch and wait approach', is variably employed in routine practice; however, there is no data to support this approach. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively collected data regarding clinician treatment recommendations for patients with newly diagnosed mCRC in addition to subsequent treatment and outcomes. Follow-up and management was according to standard protocols. RESULTS: Seven hundred and thirty-six patients (59.1% male, 40.9% female) with mCRC (January 2003-December 2010) were analysed; the median age was 67.9 years (range 26.2-95.5). Three hundred and seventy-seven patients (51.2%) received immediate chemotherapy. For 133 (18.1%), treatment was considered inappropriate. 34 patients (4.6%) declined therapy. For 192 (26.1%), a watch and wait policy was adopted and 168 (87.5%) of these received treatment, at a median of 3.7 months (range 2-35 months) from diagnosis. Compared with patients immediately treated, the number receiving all active chemotherapy agents (30.4 versus 39.3%) was similar and median survival (27 versus 17 months, P = 0.0008) was superior. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that a substantial minority of patients underwent an initial watch and wait approach. Ultimately, they received a similar treatment exposure to patients treated immediately and the survival outcomes were not compromised.
