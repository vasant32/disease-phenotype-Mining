MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules, which act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and have been implicated in initiation, progression and treatment outcome of diverse cancers. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as the most common type of genetic variation, also exist in miRNA genes and can lead to alteration in miRNA expression resulting in diverse functional consequences. Emerging studies have evaluated the association of miRNA SNPs with cancer risk, but the results remain inconclusive. To assess the relationship between miRNA SNPs and cancer risk, we performed a meta-analysis of 18 studies involving 20660 subjects for miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism and 21 studies involving 26,018 subjects for miR-196a2 rs11614913 polymorphism. As for rs2910164, no significant association of cancer risk was found in the overall analysis. In subgroup analysis by cancer type, ethnicity, source of controls and sample size, significant association of cancer risk was mainly found in papillary thyroid carcinoma, primary liver cancer, cervical cancer, Caucasian population and small sample size studies. For rs11614913, significant results were found in all the tested genetic models and T allele or its carriers were associated with decreased cancer risk in overall analysis (T vs. C: OR = 0.888, 95% CI 0.84-0.938; TT+TC vs. CC: OR = 0.897, 95% CI 0.828-0.971). In stratified analysis by cancer type and ethnicity, significant association of cancer risk was observed in breast cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer and Asian population, but not in Caucasian population. During further stratified analysis by source of controls and sample size, results similar to those of overall analysis were found in all of the subgroups. Taken together, our results indicated that miR-196a2 rs11614913 T variant probably contribute to decreased susceptibility to cancer. However, limited evidence was found for association of miR-146a rs2910164 with cancer risk, and further well-designed studies with large sample size will be necessary to validate the effect of miR-146a rs2910164 on cancer susceptibility.
