To examine the antitumor activity of a new derivative of ciprofloxacin called methoxyphenylcipro (CMPP). Cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay and apoptotic cells and reactive oxygen species were evaluated using flow cytometry. Results revealed that CMPP induces antiproliferative activity against breast cancer cells and melanoma and to a lesser extent against colorectal cancer cells. Interestingly, compared to ciprofloxacin, CMPP-induced a selective cytotoxicity against human cancer cells but not human normal fibroblasts. The potential of CMPP to inhibit cellular growth in MD-MB-486 breast cancer cells and MV3 melanoma cells was largely due to induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis, as confirmed by caspase-3 activation and cleavage of its substrate PARP. In addition, results indicated that CMPP-induced apoptosis is mediated by generation of reactive oxygen species. These findings revealed that CMPP has a selective antitumor activity against cancer cells and warrants further clinical evaluation.
