 BACKGROUND: This Japanese multicenter retrospective study evaluated short- and long-term outcomes of palliative laparoscopic procedures for symptomatic stage IV colorectal cancer compared with conventional open procedures. METHODS: Of 968 eligible patients with stage IV colorectal cancer enrolled during January 2006-December 2007 from 41 participating surgical units (Japan Society of Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery Group), we studied 409 patients who underwent palliative resection of symptomatic primary colorectal tumor. RESULTS: Data from patients with laparoscopic resection (n = 98) and open colorectal resection (n = 311) were analyzed. Eleven (11.2 %) laparoscopic operations were converted to an open procedure. Fewer complications were reported for laparoscopic resections than for open procedures (13.3 vs. 26.7 %; p = 0.0042). Postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter in the laparoscopic vs. open resection group (median, 14 vs. 17 days; p = 0.0242). Postoperative chemotherapy treatment was administered to 245 (78.9 %) patients in the open and 78 (79.6 %) patients in the laparoscopic resection group. Time from surgery to start of postoperative chemotherapy was significantly shorter in the laparoscopic vs. open resection group (median, 32 vs. 27 days; p = 0.0487). Median survival time between the two groups was not significantly different (22.0 vs. 22.2 months; p = 0.948). CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic palliative resection results in reduced postoperative complications and earlier recovery with acceptable long-term outcomes comparable with open surgery. When performed by experienced surgeons in selected patients, it may be a safe and feasible option. Because of the potential of significant bias arising from the included studies, further randomized controlled trials should be undertaken to confirm this bias.
