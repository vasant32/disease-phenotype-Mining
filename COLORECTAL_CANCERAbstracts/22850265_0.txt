 OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between Type D personality and illness perceptions among colorectal cancer survivors 1-10years post-diagnosis. METHODS: Data from two population-based surveys on colorectal cancer survivors was used. Patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2009, as registered in the Eindhoven Cancer Registry, received a questionnaire on Type D personality (DS14) and illness perceptions (B-IPQ); 81% (n=3977) responded. RESULTS: 750 (19%) patients had a Type D personality. They believe their illness has significantly more serious consequences, will last significantly longer, and experience significantly more symptoms that they attribute to their illness. Also, they are more concerned about their illness, and their disease more often influences them emotionally. Differences regarding 'consequences', 'concern' and 'emotional response' were also clinically relevant. The majority of patients stated that the cause of their disease was unknown (23.3%), hereditary (20.3%), lifestyle (15.1%), psychological distress (11.9%) or other (11.6%). Significant differences in perceptions on cause of disease between Type Ds and non-Type Ds were found for psychological distress (16.2 vs. 10.9%; p<0.01), randomness (1.7 vs. 5.3%; p<0.01) and unknown (18.8 vs. 24.4%; p<0.01). Multivariate analyses showed that Type D was negatively associated with 'coherence' and positively with 'consequences', 'timeline', 'identity', 'concern', and 'emotional representation'. CONCLUSIONS: These results elucidate the associations between personality and illness perceptions, demonstrating their close interrelatedness. Our study may be helpful in further developing theoretical models regarding giving meaning to illness and the illness perceptions that the illness elicits. Future studies should investigate whether interventions can positively impact illness perceptions of Type D cancer patients.
