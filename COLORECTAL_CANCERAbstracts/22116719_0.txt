 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate mesenteric vascular anatomy using 256 multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT)  before laparoscopic colorectal surgery. METHODS: Eleven patients with colorectal cancer underwent 256 MSCT from February 2010 to December 2010. The evaluation items were visualization of mesenteric artery and vein by 3-dimensional CT angiography, which was compared with findings on laparoscopic surgery. RESULTS: Three-dimensional CT angiography correctly demonstrated variations of the mesenteric artery and vein and were consistent with laparoscopic findings. Of the 3 patients undergoing right hemicolectomy, ileocolic artery (ICA) ran ventrally to the superior mesenteric vein(SMV) in 1 patient, whereas ICA ran dorsally to the SMV in 2 patients; the right colic artery (RCA) branched directly from superior mesenteric artery(SMA) in 2 patients; RCA was absent and the left branch of middle colic artery(MCA) fed the tumor in 1 patient. In the patients who had transverse colon resection, MCA branched from SMA. In 2 of 3 patients who underwent sigmoidectomy, sigmoid artery (SA) branched from left colic artery(LCA); in 1 of 3 patients of sigmoid resection, SA branched from inferior mesenteric artery(IMA). In 4 patients with rectal cancer, the superior rectal artery (SRA) fed the tumor. CONCLUSION: The 256 MSCT is effective for evaluating mesenteric vascular anatomy variation before laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer.
