 BACKGROUND: Rabphilin-3A-like (RPH3AL) protein functions in the regulation of hormone exocytosis, and mutations in the RPHA3L gene have been associated with tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer (CRC). We evaluated the potential use of anti-RPH3AL autoantibodies as a marker for CRC detection. METHODS: Sera from 84 patients with CRC and 63 healthy controls were analysed for the presence of RPH3AL autoantibodies with a Western blotting assay. RESULTS: The frequencies of RPH3AL autoantibodies in the early stage, advanced stage and all CRC patients were 64.7%, 78.0% and 72.6%, respectively. These values are significantly higher than the frequency of RPH3AL autoantibodies in healthy controls (15.9%, P<0.001). Although the presence of RPH3AL autoantibodies did not correlate with clinical parameters, RPH3AL autoantibodies were found in 69.4% (34/49) of CRC patients who were negative for carcinoembryonic antigen. The value of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of RPH3AL autoantibody was 0.84, which suggests that screening for these autoantibodies could potentially be used for CRC diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Circulating RPH3AL autoantibodies are prevalent in patients with CRC, and detection of these autoantibodies might provide a novel non-invasive approach for CRC diagnosis.
