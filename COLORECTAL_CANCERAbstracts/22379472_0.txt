Colorectal cancer remains the second leading cause of death from malignant disease. Despite improvements in the treatment modalities offered to patients, more than half of the operated patients die from the disease. The most common presenting symptoms of colonic carcinoma are changes in bowel habits, bleeding, abdominal pain, abdominal mass, stools mixed with mucus or not, weight loss, anorexia, and other characteristics related to metastasis. Here, the case of a 74-year-old female patient with colon cancer perforation presenting as a strangulating ventral hernia and a mini-review of the current literature are presented.
