Introduction. Follow-up surveillance after curative treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC) patients is recommended to detect early cancer recurrences and improve survival outcomes. However, a substantial proportion of CRC patients do not undergo cancer surveillance. Several demographic and disease-related factors have been associated with cancer surveillance adherence. Thus far, patient-centered communication has not been studied as a determinant for undergoing cancer surveillance. The purpose of this study is to determine whether patient-clinician information engagement (PCIE) influences patients' self-reported adherence to recommended CRC surveillance procedures.  Methods. The study was a longitudinal survey among Pennsylvanian patients diagnosed with CRC in 2005. CRC patients who were eligible for surveillance and participated in both the baseline and 1-year follow-up surveys were included in this analysis (n = 305). The main outcome measure was self-reported adherence to physical examination, carcinoembryonic antigen testing, and colonoscopy according to recommended guidelines.  Results. Controlling for potential confounders, higher PCIE at baseline predicted a higher odds for CRC patients reporting adherence to recommended surveillance 1 year later by 2.8 times. Other significant predictors of adhering to recommended surveillance were a higher education level and having received systemic therapy.  Discussion. In this longitudinal study among CRC patients who received curative treatment, greater patient engagement with clinicians about cancer-related information was found to improve patients' subsequent adherence to recommended surveillance. This finding provides support for encouraging greater patient-physician communication among CRC patients.
