This article reports findings from a qualitative study that explored the attitudes and beliefs concerning colorectal cancer (CRC) screening among patients and health care providers in Appalachian Kentucky. Results from 5 focus groups are discussed here: 3 with primary care providers and 2 with patients. Although there are some areas of agreement, there are marked differences between the perceptions of Appalachian health care providers and participants regarding CRC screening. This article compares and contrasts those perceptions and provides suggestions for culturally competent practice and culturally relevant research to improve CRC screening in this vulnerable population.
