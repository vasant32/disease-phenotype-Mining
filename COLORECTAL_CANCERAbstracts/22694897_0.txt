A major problem concerning the addition of more drugs in a chemotherapy combination is designing a proper schedule assuring the balance between dose intensity of each drug, efficacy of the combination, and tolerability lessening the burden of drug toxicity. We evaluated triplet chemotherapy-based intensive regimens proposed as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Using a FOLFOXIRI (5-fluorouracil [5-FU], irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) combination regimen, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer now have the possibility of longer survival, but disappointingly, with increased toxicities. Triplet chemotherapy regimen according to 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan /5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, characterized by timed flat-infusion 5-FU administration, without leucovorin, obtained efficacy equivalent to other reported similar combination regimens (5-FU, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin), with increased received 5-FU dose intensity and lower grade 3 to 4 neutropenia. To guarantee the proper balance between dose intensities, efficacy, and toxicity, triplet chemotherapy schedules could be further improved by abrogation of folinic acid and bolus 5-FU, a new and easy modality of 5-FU administration, such as timed flat-infusion 5-FU, associated with alternating irinotecan and oxaliplatin; this could favor diffusion of this intensive treatment in clinical practice.
