 PURPOSE: This study was conducted to test the efficacy and toxicity of cetuximab and irinotecan as a biweekly regimen in treatment of elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-nine elderly patients (≥65 years) with mCRC who progressed after at least one previous line of treatment were enrolled into this study from May 2008 to January 2011. All recruited patients received cetuximab 500 mg/m(2) and irinotecan 180 mg/m(2) every 2 weeks. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients (76 %) were men, and 76 % of patients had colonic cancer in origin. Median age was 69 years. Median overall survival time was 7 months, and median progression-free survival was 4 months. Grade 3-4 skin rash occurred in 20 % of patients, grade 3-4 diarrhea in 18 % of patients, and neutropenia in 28 % of patients. CONCLUSION: Cetuximab combined with irinotecan when administered biweekly is safe and effective for treatment of pretreated elderly patients with mCRC.
