 OBJECTIVE: To explore the correlation between excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1) C8092A and C19007T gene polymorphisms and different Chinese medicine (CM) syndrome types of colorectal cancer (CC). METHODS: Ninety-nine patients with CC were syndrome typed as dampness-heat accumulation syndrome, qi stagnation with blood stasis syndrome, Pi-Shen yang deficiency syndrome, and Gan-Shen yin deficiency syndrome. The gene polymorphisms of excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1) C8092A and C19007T in different CM syndrome types of CC were examined by polymorphisms chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing, and analyzed statistically. RESULTS: The frequencies of C8092A genotype and allele in different CM syndrome types had no statistical difference (P > 0.05). The frequencies of C19007T genotype and allele in different CM syndrome types had statistical difference (P < 0.05). Of them, there was no statistical difference in the frequencies between dampness-heat accumulation syndrome and qi stagnation with blood stasis syndrome, or between Pi-Shen yang deficiency syndrome and Gan-Shen yin deficiency syndrome (P > 0.05). There was statistical difference between dampness-heat accumulation syndrome and Pi-Shen yang deficiency syndrome as well as Gan-Shen yin deficiency syndrome (P < 0.05). There was statistical difference between qi stagnation with blood stasis syndrome and Pi-Shen yang deficiency syndrome as well as Gan-Shen yin deficiency syndrome (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: ERCC1 C19007T gene polymorphisms might be associated with CM syndrome types of CC, which needed to be further studied.
