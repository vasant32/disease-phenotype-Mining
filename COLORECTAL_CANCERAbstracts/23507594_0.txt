 BACKGROUND: Central venous access port(CV port)is used for long-term treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. To confirm a standard procedure of CV port implant, we analyzed long-term outcomes and complications of upper arm CV ports. METHODS: Ninety patients implanted with CV ports in the upper arm between November 2006 and November 2009 were studied retrospectively. RESULTS: There were no complications from the implanting procedure. Twenty patients (22. 2%)had complications, including infection(n=10), occlusion(n=7), thrombosis(n=4)and persistent pain(n=1) (there is some overlapping). Eighteen patients(20%)received surgery for removal of the ports. The median follow-up period was 160 days(range, 30-1,167days). Univariate and multivariate analysis indicated that patients with a catheter tip above the tracheal bifurcation had a significantly higher risk for complications than patients with a tip below bifurcation. CONCLUSION: Upper arm CV ports were implanted safely. For long-term use, it is important to place the catheter tip below the tracheal bifurcation.
