 AIMS: Liver resection is indicated for several primary and secondary liver lesions. We follow up our earlier experience with the use of InLine Multichannel Radiofrequency Device (ILMRD, Resect Medical Inc., Fremont, CA) a device that produces coagulative necrosis along the transection plane. METHODS: The records of 68 consecutive patients who underwent liver resection for primary and metastatic liver tumors from August 2000 to December 2008 were reviewed. Data analyzed include demographic data as well as complexity of liver resection, intra-operative blood loss, use of portal triad clamping and transfusion of blood. Postoperative outcomes measured were morbidity, hospital and ICU length of stay. RESULTS: The median estimated blood loss was 150 mL in the ILMRD group compared to 400 mL in the non-ILMRD group (p < 0.0001). Median length of stay was decreased in the ILMRD group by a day (7 vs. 8 p < 0.003). There was a significant decrease in frequency of parenchymal clamp time (57% vs 84%, p < 0.001) and median total portal triad clamp time (2.5 vs 30 min p < 0.0001). We also noted a significant decrease in the median portal triad clamp time (0 vs 25 min, p < 0.001) used during the parenchymal transection phase. Furthermore, use of the ILMRD device allowed us to perform more complex hepatic resections. CONCLUSION: Use of ILMRD to perform radiofrequency-assisted hepatic resection was associated with a significant decrease in intra-operative blood loss and earlier discharge from the hospital despite increasing complexity of resections and decreased use of portal triad clamping.
