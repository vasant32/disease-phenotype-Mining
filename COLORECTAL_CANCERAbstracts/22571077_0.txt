 PURPOSE: Laparoscopic surgery for colon cancer has been proven safe, but controversy continues over implementation of laparoscopic technique for rectal cancer. The aim of this study was to compare the long-term outcomes of laparoscopically assisted and open surgery for nonmetastatic colorectal cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From January 2001 to December 2006 all patients with nonmetastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum were considered for inclusion in this prospective non-randomised trial. The primary endpoint was overall survival, disease free survival and recurrence rate. Analysis was by intention to treat. RESULTS: A total of 365 resections were performed for nonmetastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum during the study period. Of those resections, 220 were colonic and 145 were rectal. In the patients with colon cancer 119 (54.1%) were operated laparoscopically and 101 (45.9%) by open surgery, in the patients with rectal cancer 75 (51.7%) were treated by laparoscopy and 70 (48.3%) by open technique. No statistically significant difference was found between the laparoscopic and open group regarding 5-year overall survival (p = 0.17 for colon cancer, p = 0.60 for rectal cancer), 5-year disease free survival (p = 0.25 for colon cancer, p = 0.81 for rectal cancer) and overall recurrence (p = 0.78 for colon cancer, p = 0.79 for rectal cancer). With respect to the tumor stage, in rectal cancer the probability of 5-year disease free survival was significantly higher in the laparoscopic group in stage III (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer is an oncologically safe procedure that is associated with a survival and recurrence rate equal to open surgery.
