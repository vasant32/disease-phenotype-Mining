We evaluated the predictive relevance of several biomarkers on the survival of patients with stage III colorectal cancer treated with adjuvant chemotherapy of oral fluoropyrimidines. This was a multicenter phase II trial on adult patients with histologically confirmed resected stage III (Dukes' C) colorectal cancer. Patients received oral doxifluridine (800 mg/m2/day) in 3 divided doses, or oral uracil/tegafur (UFT) (400 mg/m2/day) in 2 divided doses for 5 days, every 7 days for 12 months with a 5-year follow-up. Outcome measures were disease-free survival and tissue markers [thymidine phosphorylase (TP), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) protein levels and TP, DPD, thymidylate synthase (TS) and orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT) mRNA levels in tumor samples and TS tandem-repeat type in blood samples]. There was a significant association between the intratumoral TP/DPD enzyme ratio and disease-free survival when the model included the drug, the parameter and the interactions between them [hazard ratio (HR)=2.76; P=0.00469]. The 5-year disease-free survival rate was statistically significantly higher in patients with high TP/DPD ratios [median â‰¥2.63: 71.9%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 61.4-80.0] compared to patients with low TP/DPD ratios (<2.63: 57.0%; 95% CI 46.3-66.3) (log-rank P=0.0277) following adjuvant therapy with oral fluoropyrimidines. No significant association was observed between the intratumoral TP/DPD enzyme ratio (cut-off value 2.0) and the disease-free survival rate in the doxifluridine group; primary endpoint (log-rank P=0.6850). The magnitude of the intratumoral TP/DPD enzyme ratio may be a potential indicator for the individualization of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with oral fluoropyrimidines for stage III colorectal cancer.
