The aim of this study was to initiate a survey of human autoantibody responses to a panel of select colorectal tumor-associated antigens identified by previous serological analysis of a cDNA expression library and to subsequently identify multiple serological biomarkers for the detection of colorectal cancer. For screening of autoantibodies against colorectal tumor-associated antigens, sera from 94 colorectal cancer patients and 54 normal controls were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant rCCCAP, rHDAC5, rP53, rNMDAR and rNY-CO-16 proteins as coating antigens. Seropositivity among colorectal cancer patients to the 5 individual coating antigens varied from 18.1% to 35.1%. Seropositivity to any of the 5 coating antigens was 58.5% and combining this analysis with evaluation of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (> or =5 ng/ml) significantly increased the seropositivity to 77.6%. Seropositivity of early-stage (Dukes' Stages A and B) colorectal cancer patients to CEA was 21.9%, and seropositivity to any of the 5 colorectal cancer-associated antigens was 53.7%, and the combination of these 2 measurements resulted in a higher diagnostic capacity (65.9%) than either marker alone. In conclusion, these results collectively indicated that combined detection of serum autoantibody profiles against our panel of colorectal tumor-associated antigens and the analysis of carcinoembryonic antigen provides a promising diagnostic biomarker for colorectal cancer, particularly among early-stage patients.
