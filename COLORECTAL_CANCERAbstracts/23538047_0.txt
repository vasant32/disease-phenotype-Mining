Mutation analysis of KRAS is needed before starting treatment with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). In most of the cases, testing is performed on primary tumors, assuming that KRAS mutation status does not change in metastasis although correlation studies gave conflicting results. We evaluated the KRAS status concordance rate between primary tumors and related metastasis using a highly sensitive molecular assay. Forty-five primary tumors and related metastases from patients with CRC (28/45 male-62.2% and 17/45 female-37.8%; mean age 66.4 years) were analyzed by using TheraScreen: KRAS mutational kit. Metastatic samples were collected from lymph nodes (8/45-17.8%) and visceral sites (37/45-82.2%); 23 were synchronous (49%) and 22 were metachronous (51%), obtained after a mean of 30.8 months after the first diagnosis of CRC. Twenty-eight patients had KRAS mutations in both primary CRC and related metastases (62.2%). No differences in type and frequency of mutations were identified, despite different metastatic sites and time of onset of metastatic disease. Our results indicate that the mutation status of KRAS is the same in primary CRC and metastasis, suggesting that in clinical practice, KRAS testing can be performed on both tumor tissues when using a highly sensitive molecular assay.
