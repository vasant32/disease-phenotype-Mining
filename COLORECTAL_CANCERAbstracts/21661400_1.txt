 BACKGROUND/AIMS: Although changes in serum lipid profile have been reported in CRC, the specific association between serum lipid profile and lymph node stages remains uncertain. METHODOLOGY: Fasting serum lipid profile, including TC, TG, HDL-C and LDL-C was retrospectively evaluated in 968 patients undergoing curative resection for primary CRC. To determine the nutritional status, the serum albumin levels were measured and BMI was calculated. Statistical analyses were performed to investigate the association of serum lipid profile with lymph node stages. RESULTS: Serum lipid levels correlated well with rate of lymph node metastasis and high LDL-C and low HDL-C levels tended to present more advanced lymph node stages. The observed elevation of the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio for patients with N2 stage was statistically significant when compared with patients with N1 stage. When separated by gender, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that both LDL-C levels and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio had independent association with advanced N2 stage in males, but not in females. In addition, LDL-C/HDL-C ratio might be a more effective biomarker for identifying N2 stage than LDL-C levels alone (OR value: 2.85 vs. 1.63). CONCLUSIONS: Elevated serum LDL-C levels and an increased LDC-C/HDL-C ratio might favour development of lymph node metastasis and LDCC/HDL-C ratio might be a more effective biomarker for identifying advanced N2 stage than LDL-C levels alone, especially for male patients with CRC.
