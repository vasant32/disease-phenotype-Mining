To evaluate the prognostic value of preoperative serum carbohydrate antigen19-9 (CA19-9), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) for overall survival (OS) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Preoperative serum CA19-9, CEA, and CA125 levels were detected by C12 protein chip diagnostic system in 80 patients with CRC, and the association of their preoperative status with the patients' OS was analyzed. Patients with positive preoperative serum CA19-9, CA125, and CEA had a worse survival comparing with those negative patients, the difference in CA19-9 and CA125 reached statistical significance (Log rank test, P<0.05), but the difference of CEA did not achieve statistical significance (Log rank test, P>0.05). The OS of patients with CRC with three positive tumor markers (TMs)<1 or 2 positive TMs<negative TM, simultaneously positive serum CA19-9, CEA, and CA125 was the most dismal predicting factor for OS. Spearman correlations revealed that the preoperative serum status of CA19-9 (P=0.000), CEA (P=0.000), and CA125 (P=0.000) had correlations with stage; the preoperative serum CA125 status (r=-0.385, P=0.000) and stage (r=-0.457, P=0.000) and location (r=0.223, P=0.047) had correlations with OS. Multivariate analysis with Cox regression model showed that only stage (P=0.000) and the preoperative serum CA125 status (P=0.016) were independent prognostic factors for OS of patients with CRC. The preoperative status of serum CA19-9, CEA, and CA125 had correlations with CRC stage. The simultaneously positive serum CA19-9, CEA, and CA125 was the most dismal predicting factor for OS of patients with CRC. Preoperative serum CA125 status and stage were independent prognostic factors for OS of CRC.
