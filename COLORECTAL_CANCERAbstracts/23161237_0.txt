 BACKGROUND: DNA repair processes play an important role in protection against carcinogenic factors. Mutations in DNA repair genes, which code proteins engaged in repair processes, may lead to carcinogenesis and among others also to colorectal cancer (CRC) development. The genetic variability in RAD51 may contribute to the appearance and progression of various cancers including CRC. The aim of the study was to compare the distribution of genotypes of RAD51 135G>C and 172G>T polymorphism between colorectal cancer patients and controls. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Both polymorphisms were evaluated by PCR-RFLP methods in colorectal tissue of 320 colorectal cancer subjects and 320 healthy subjects who served as controls. RESULTS: In the present work we demonstrated a significant positive association between the RAD51 C/C genotype and colorectal carcinoma. Variant 135C allele of RAD51 increased the cancer risk. However, we did not observe any relationship between each polymorphism and colorectal cancer progression assessed by node metastasis, tumour size and Dukes' stage. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that variant genotypes of the 135G>C of RAD51 polymorphism may be positively associated with colorectal carcinoma in the Polish population. Further studies conducted on a larger group are required to clarify this point.
