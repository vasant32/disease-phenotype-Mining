 AIM: This phase I study evaluated sunitinib plus modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6: 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin) in Japanese patients with treatment-na√Øve metastatic colorectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sunitinib was administered orally (37.5 mg/day, 4 weeks on, 2 weeks off [Schedule 4/2; arm A] or 50 mg/day, 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off [Schedule 2/2; arm B]) with mFOLFOX6. RESULTS: In arms A/B, respectively (n=6 each): median relative dose intensity was 50.4%/89.1% for sunitinib and 39.2-69.8%/73.0-80.5% for mFOLFOX6 components. Most adverse events were grade 1/2. The most frequent grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. No significant drug-drug interactions were detected. Four patients had objective responses in each arm. CONCLUSION: Sunitinib plus mFOLFOX6 had acceptable tolerability, with the Schedule 2/2 combination being generally more manageable than the Schedule 4/2. Based on two global trials and the present study, sunitinib on Schedule 2/2 combined with chemotherapy may be considered, if further first-line trials are planned.
