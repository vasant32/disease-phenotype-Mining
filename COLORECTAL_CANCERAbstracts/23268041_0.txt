Vaginal metastasis is extremely rare, as is metastatic colorectal cancer. A 78-year-old woman was diagnosed with rectal cancer and uterine fibroid. Low anterior resection and simple hysterectomy was performed and the final diagnosis was fStage IIIa. Adjuvant chemotherapy was not performed. One year after the surgery, she was referred to our hospital with the chief complaint of hematuria. A tumor was observed in the posterior wall of the vagina. We performed vaginal mucosal resection and the pathological diagnosis was metastasis of rectal cancer. One year and 5 months after the surgery, we performed left inguinal node dissection and the pathological diagnosis was metastasis of rectal cancer. The patient has remained disease-free for 3 years and 5 months without adjuvant chemotherapy after resection of the vaginal metastasis.
