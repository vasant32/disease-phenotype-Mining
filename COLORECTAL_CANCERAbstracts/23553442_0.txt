Bcl-2-associated athanogene 3 (Bag-3) belongs to a member of the Hsc70 binding co-chaperone Bag-family proteins and has critical roles in protein homeostasis, cell survival, actin organization, cell adhesion, cell motility and tumor metastasis. To clarify the role of Bag-3 in colorectal carcinogenesis and subsequent development, its expression was examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) on tissue microarrays containing colorectal carcinomas, adenomas, non-neoplastic mucosa (NNM) and metastatic carcinomas in lymph node and liver. Colorectal carcinoma tissue and cell lines were studied for Bag-3 expression by RT-PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence. The results demonstrated that Bag3 was distinctly expressed in Colo201, Colo205, DLD-1, HCT-15, HCT-116, HT-29, KM-12, SW480, SW620, and WiDr at both mRNA and protein levels. Carcinoma showed stronger Bag-3 expression than adjacent NNM by IHC and Western blot (P⟨0.05), while its mRNA had the opposite by real-time PCR and ISH (P⟨0.05). Metastatic carcinoma more frequently expressed Bag-3 mRNA in lymph node and liver than in primary carcinoma (P⟨0.05). Immunohistochemically, Bag-3 expression was seen to gradually decrease in samples from carcinoma adenoma to NNM (P⟨0.05). There was a positive correlation between Bag-3 expression and TNM staging and GRP94 expression (P⟨0.05), but no relationship to patient age or sex, tumor size, depth of invasion, lymphatic or venous invasion, lymph node metastasis, differentiation or prognosis of colorectal carcinomas (P⟩0.05). Our study indicated that aberrant Bag-3 expression might be involved in colorectal adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence and subsequent progression.
