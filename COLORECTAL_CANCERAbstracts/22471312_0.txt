 AIM: The prevalence of abdominal wall herniation at the site of a previous temporary stoma is uncertain. This cohort study investigated the frequency of radiological abnormalities at the site of a closed diverting loop ileostomy. METHOD: All patients in whom an ileostomy was raised and later closed during a 5-year period formed the study group. When colorectal cancer surveillance computed tomography (CT) was undertaken the images were scrutinized and graded as to defined anatomical abnormalities. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-nine patients had an ileostomy, of which 92 were diverting. Fifty-nine (64%) were closed at various intervals (median time to closure 6 (2-22) months and 43 underwent a surveillance CT at 1-3 (median 2) years. At 1 year an abnormality (atrophy or defect) at the site of closure was seen in 16 (37%) CT scans. These were more frequent with increasing duration of follow-up. One asymptomatic hernia was detected at 2 years but there was no deterioration in the abdominal wall at 3 years when compared with that at 2 years. CONCLUSION: Abnormalities in the abdominal wall at the site of a closed diverting ileostomy are common but true herniation is unusual. The routine use of prophylactic mesh at ileostomy closure may be unnecessary.
