Epidemiological studies suggest that colonic production of butyrate and estrogen may be involved in human susceptibility to colorectal cancer (CRC). Estrone (E1) can be produced by the aromatase pathway during the conversion of androstenedione (A) to E1. Therefore, we studied the effect of sodium butyrate (NaBu) on the CYP19A1 transcript and protein levels and on the conversion of A to E1 in HT29, DLD-1 and LoVo CRC cells. We found that NaBu significantly downregulated CYP19A1 transcript and protein levels, a phenomenon that was associated with reduced conversion of A to E1 in HT29, DLD-1 and LoVo cells. Our studies demonstrated that, although butyrate exhibited a protective role in CRC development, this compound may reduce aromatase activity and the production of E1 in colon cancer cells.
