 BACKGROUND: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a hereditary disease induced by germ-line mutations in the tumor suppressor APC gene. These initiate the early stages of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence in familial, but also in sporadic (in 80% to 90%), colon tumorigenesis. We found the presence of APC-like sequences in bacteria of FAP patients. MATERIAL/METHODS: We analyzed bacteria isolated from FAP patients' rectal swabs. Total bacterial DNA was isolated and analyzed for detection of APC-like sequences using PCR. We also tested DNA homology rate and APC-like protein production. RESULTS: We collected blood samples and rectal swabs from patients with confirmed diagnosis of FAP. They were analyzed for presence of sections from exon 15 of the APC gene. Most positive results were found in sections located exactly in the area called the MCR (mutation cluster region), where the highest frequency of APC gene mutations were identified. By sequencing PCR products from bacteria in section F-G together with a patient's DNA sample and human APC gene, we found a more than 90% DNA homology rate. We also confirmed production of APC-like protein using Western blotting. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested two hypotheses. The APC-like protein might have same function as a truncated APC product, which is synthesized in most cases of mutations of APC gene in the MCR region in colorectal cancer cells. Alternatively, we can consider the possible existence of horizontal transfer of genetic information between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Our study can be considered as a pilot project. For confirmation of our hypotheses, further research is needed.
