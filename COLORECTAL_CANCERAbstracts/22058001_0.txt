Vascular  endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an endothelial cell-specific mitogen  involved in a number of pathologic processes, including angiogenesis, tumor  growth and metastasis. Polymorphisms of the VEGF gene have been associated with  susceptibility to colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the specific association  still remains controversial. We made a meta-analysis of the association  between VEGF gene polymorphisms and CRC risk. Only eight case-control studies  were retrieved, with a total of 2337 CRC patients and 2032 healthy controls.  Six VEGF gene polymorphisms were addressed in all studies included, +936C>T  (rs3025039), -2578C>A (rs699947), -1154G>A (rs1570360), -634G>C  (rs2010963), -460C>T (rs833061), and +405C>G (rs2010963). There was a  significant association between -2578C>A polymorphism and susceptibility to  CRC in the comparison of C allele carriers (CC + CA) versus AA (odds ratio =  0.77, 95% confidence interval = 0.62-0.96, P = 0.02). No association was found  between +936C>T, -1154G>A, -634G>C, -460C>T, and +405C>G with  susceptibility to CRC. We conclude that the C allele carrier (CC + CA) of VEGF  -2578C>A polymorphism appears to be a protective factor for CRC.
