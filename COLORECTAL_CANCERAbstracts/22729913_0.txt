Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an important role in cancer development and aggression. MMP-9 polymorphisms may affect MMPs expression and contribute to interindividual differences in susceptibility to a wide spectrum of cancers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of MMP-9 P574R and R668Q polymorphisms with colorectal cancer (CRC); and to explore the relationship among the polymorphisms and clinicopathologic parameters, serum tumor markers and lipids. The genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment lengthy polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Tumor markers were measured with the Electro ChemiL uminescence method. Lipids levels were analyzed using an automatic biochemistry analyzer. The both polymorphisms were not associated with the risk of CRC risk. The clinicopathologic parameters, tumor markers were not associated with MMP-9 polymorphisms. Total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were significantly higher in patients with P574R PP genotype compared with patients with P574R PR combined RR genotypes (P = 0.043 and P = 0.038 respectively). Our data suggested that MMP-9 P574R and R668Q were not associated with CRC risk, but P574R affected serum LDL-C and TC levels in CRC patients.
