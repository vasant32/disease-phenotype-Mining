Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a frequently diagnosed cancer and causing significant mortality in the patients. Metastasis caused by CRC is mainly responsible for this cancer-related deaths. Despite recent advancements in the treatment methods, prognosis remains poor. Therefore, effective treatment strategies need to be designed for successful management of this disease. Dehydroepiandrostenedione (DHEA), a 17-ketosteroid hormone produced by adrenal glands, gonads and including gastrointestinal tract is required for several physiological processes. Deregulation of DHEA levels leads to various disease conditions including cancer. In fact, several experimental studies strongly suggest that DHEA could be used as a chemopreventive agent against colon cancer. Prenlyation of certain membrane proteins such as phosphatase of regenerating liver-3 (PRL-3) is crucial for metastatic progression of colon cancer cells. The ability of DHEA to target prenylation pathway could be utilized to inhibit PRL-3 prenylation for successful prevention of CRC metastases. As DHEA is a widely consumed drug for various ailments, incorporation of DHEA in the treatment regimen may be beneficial to prevent or delay the occurrence of metastasis resulting from CRC.
