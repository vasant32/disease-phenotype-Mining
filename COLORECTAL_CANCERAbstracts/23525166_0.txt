Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is the main subunit of the core enzyme telomerase, which consists of three subunits. Telomeres are essential for chromosomal stability and integrity, protecting the ends of chromosomes from degradation and preventing chromosomal end fusions and recombination. A loss of telomere function is a major mechanism for the generation of chromosomal abnormalities. Telomere shortening leads to mutations, chromosome rearrangements and translocations. Colorectal laterally spreading tumors (LSTs) are a special type of superficial colorectal tumor. They are considered to have a high malignancy potential. The aim of the present study was to characterize the expression of hTERT in an LST cell line and paraffin sections. Immunohistochemistry was utilized to examine the protein expression of hTERT in the LST cell line, 48 resected LSTs, 48 protruded-type colorectal adenomas (PAs) and 48 normal mucosa samples. Statistical analyses were applied to test the associations between hTERT expression and clinicopathological parameters. The present study demonstrated that the positive expression levels of hTERT in LSTs, PAs and normal mucosa were 60.4, 22.9 and 10%, respectively. Compared with polypi and normal mucosa, the expression levels of hTERT were significantly increased in LSTs. The expression of hTERT was also observed in the LST cell line. The expression of hTERT was significantly higher in LSTs, which may indicate a potential for malignancy.
