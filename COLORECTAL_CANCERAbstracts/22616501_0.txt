Liver metastases of colorectal cancer are a challenge in current oncology. Less than 5% of untreated patients are alive after 5 years of diagnosis. The only curative treatment is surgical resection, but there are other options for palliative or neoadjuvant treatment such as transarterial chemoembolization. Serious complications after liver chemoembolization are very rare, and one of the possible complications is a liver abscess. We report a case of hepatogastric fistula caused by a liver abscess ten days after the chemoembolization of a liver metastasis. It was treated surgically with left hepatectomy and parcial gastrectomy, with good outcome. There are only a few reported cases of hepatogastric fistula after liver transarterial chemoembolization.
