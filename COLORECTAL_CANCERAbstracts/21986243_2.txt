Computer-based multimedia technologies can be used to tailor health messages, but promotoras (Spanish-speaking community health workers) rarely use these tools. Promotoras delivered health messages about colorectal cancer screening to medically underserved Latinos in South Texas using two small media formats: a "low-tech" format (flipchart and video) and a "high-tech" format consisting of a tailored, interactive computer program delivered on a tablet computer. Using qualitative methods, the authors observed promotora training and intervention delivery and conducted interviews with five promotoras to compare and contrast program implementation of both formats. The authors discuss the ways each format aided or challenged promotoras' intervention delivery. Findings reveal that some aspects of both formats enhanced intervention delivery by tapping into Latino health communication preferences and facilitating interpersonal communication, whereas other aspects hindered intervention delivery. This study contributes to our understanding of how community health workers use low- and high-tech small media formats when delivering health messages to Latinos.
