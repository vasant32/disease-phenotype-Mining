 BACKGROUND: Homeodomein only protein x (HOPX) gene methylation has frequently been detected in cancer tissues. The methylation status of the HOPX gene in colorectal cancer was examined and compared to the clinocopathological findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-nine tumor samples and corresponding normal tissues were obtained from colorectal cancer patients who underwent surgery at our hospital. The methylation status of the HOPX gene in these samples was examined by quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP). Subsequently, the clinicopathological findings were correlated with the methylation status of the HOPX gene. RESULTS: HOPX gene methylation was found in 46 (52%) out of the 89 colorectal carcinomas, suggesting that it was frequently observed in colorectal cancer. A significant increase of methylation was observed in the poorly differentiated carcinomas (p=0.0049). CONCLUSION: HOPX gene methylation could play an important role for the development of colorectal cancer and is closely related to the histological type.
