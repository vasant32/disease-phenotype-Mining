Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) and MBL-associated serine protease 2 (MASP-2) are key factors of the lectin pathway of complement activation. Polymorphisms of the MBL2 and MASP-2 genes affect serum levels of MBL and MASP-2. In patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), the MBL and MASP-2 serum levels are increased and high MASP-2 levels are associated with recurrence and poor survival, whereas low MBL levels predict post-operative pneumonia. It is not known whether these associations are genetically based. In this study, the MBL and MASP-2 genotypes are investigated in 593 patients with CRC and 348 healthy controls. The potential association between genetic profile and infections, recurrence and survival is evaluated. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MBL2 were analysed using TaqMan assays, with characterization of MBL2 wildtype A, variants B, C and D and alleles H/L, Y/X and P/Q. The SNP D120G for MASP-2 was determined. Serum levels of MBL and MASP-2 were measured. The MBL2 and MASP-2 genotype distribution was similar among patients with CRC and healthy controls and MBL2 genotype significantly associated with MBL concentration in serum (P<0.0001). No significant association between MBL2/MASP-2 genotype and post-operative infectious complications (P=0.33 and 0.22), recurrent cancer or survival (P=0.74 and P=0.61 respectively) was found. Thus, the increased serum levels of MBL and MASP-2 found in patients with CRC are not explained for by genetic profiles. In contrast to what has been demonstrated for serum levels of MBL and MASP-2, the genotypes do not predict disease course of the CRC patients.
