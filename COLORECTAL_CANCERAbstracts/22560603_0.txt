 OBJECTIVE: To implement a fast-track (FT) protocol in a colorectal surgery unit, checking its safety when applied to patients subjected to elective colorectal surgery, by evaluating the differences in morbidity and hospital stay compared to a control group with traditional care. We also analyse the functional recovery of the FT group. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective cohort study with non-concurrent control, was conducted on a group of 108 patients operated on for colorectal cancer between 2008 and 2009, to which the FT protocol was applied, and a control group (CG) of 147 patients subjected to surgery between 2005 and 2007 with similar characteristics, with traditional postoperative care. RESULTS: The demographic characteristics, anaesthetic risk, and the surgical procedures performed were similar, with a higher number of patients with laparoscopic approach in the FT group. The compliance with the items in our FT protocol was high (72.2-92.6%). Complications were observed in 77 patients (52%) in the GC compared to 30 (27.8%) in the FT group (P<.001), mainly due to the decrease in surgical wound infection (P<.001). Mortality and the number of readmissions were less in the FT group, with no statistically significant differences. The median hospital stay was 14 days in the CG and 8 in the FT group (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The applying of an FT program in colorectal surgery is safe, leading to a significant decrease in morbidity and hospital stay, without increasing the number of readmissions.
