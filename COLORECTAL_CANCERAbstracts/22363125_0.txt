 AIM: To screen the differential expressed genes in colorectal cancer and polyp tissue samples. METHODS: Tissue specimens containing 16 cases of colorectal adenocarcinoma and colorectal polyp vs normal mucosae were collected and subjected to cDNA microarray and bioinformatical analyses. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to confirm some of the cDNA microarray data. RESULTS: The experimental data showed that eight genes were differentially expressed, most of which were upregulated in adenomatous polyp lesions. Forty-six genes expressions were altered in colorectal cancers, of which 29 were upregulated and 17 downregulated, as compared to the normal mucosae. In addition, 18 genes were similarly altered in both adenomatous polyps and colorectal cancer. qRT-PCR analyses confirmed the cDNA microarray data for four of those 18 genes: MTA1, PDCD4, TSC1 and PDGFRA. CONCLUSION: These differentially expressed genes likely represent biomarkers for early detection of colorectal cancer and may be potential therapeutic targets after confirmed by further studies.
