 OBJECTIVE: To verify the clinical therapeutic effect of warming needle moxibustion on improvement of the gastrointestinal and immune function in patients with postoperation of colorectal cancer. METHODS: One hundred and five patients with postoperation of colorectal cancer were randomly divided into an acupuncture and moxibustion group, a Chinese medicine group and a routine treatment group, 35 cases in each group. They were all treated with gastrointestinal decompression and fluid replacement after operation. The acupuncture and moxibustion group was also treated with warming needle moxibustion on the 1st day after operation, and Zusanli (ST 36), Shangjuxu (ST 37) and Xiajuxu (ST 39) etc. were selected, once a day for 10 days, and the Chinese medicine group with Simo Decoction oral solution, three times daily for 10 days. The gastrointestinal function, peripheral blood components and changes of T lymphocyte and NK cells in postoperative patients were observed. RESULTS: The time of the first bowel sound, exhaust and defecation in the acupuncture and moxibustion group were all shorter than those in the Chinese medicine group and the routine treatment group (P<0.05, P<0.01). On the 10th day after operation, the percentages distribution of lymphocyte and neutrophil in the acupuncture and moxibustion group were better than those in the Chinese medicine group and the routine treatment group (all P<0.05). The acupuncture and moxibustion group was also superior to the Chinese medicine group and the routine treatment group in improving the subgroup of T lymphocyte, NK cells and the digestive system symptoms (all P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Warming needle moxibustion has a good therapeutic effect on gastrointestinal function and can regulate bidirectionally peripheral blood lymphocyte and neutrophile granulocyte and improve the T lymphocyte subgroup and NK cells so as to promote the recovery of immune function in patients with colorectal cancer after operation.
