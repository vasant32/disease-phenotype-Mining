The purpose of this review article is to highlight articles and new research regarding the link between NF-ĸB and several cancers. This review presents the most up-to-date NF-ĸB research and how it links this important transcription factor with hematology and oncology. It was written by conducting a thorough search of Pubmed as well as several journals such as Cancer, Nature, Science, Cell and those of one of the authors. The articles relating to the link between NF-ĸB and cancer were used to write this review. The results of this study clarified that there is a critical link between NF-ĸB and cancer. NF-ĸB has often been implicated in a variety of different diseases and it plays a variety of roles in cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation of cells. In cancer, NF-ĸB plays a pivotal role by facilitating oncogenesis as well as metastasis. A thorough understanding of NF-ĸB and its role in cancer can lead to future studies and drug development which could provide a novel option in the treatment of this disease.
