 INTRODUCTION: NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) rs1800566 polymorphism is found to have a lower enzymatic activity, which may result in increased incidence of several kinds of carcinomas including colorectal cancer. Results from published studies on the association of NQO1 rs1800566 genetic polymorphism with the risk of colorectal cancer are inconsistent. We performed a meta-analysis to summarize the possible association. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All eligible published studies were searched from PubMed and Elsevier ScienceDirect. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were analyzed for additive, dominant, and recessive models to assess the association using fixed- or random-effect model. RESULTS: We identified 12 case-control studies that include 5,525 cases and 6,272 controls for the present meta-analysis. Significant associations between NQO1 rs1800566 genetic polymorphism and risk of colorectal cancer were observed in additive (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.02-1.16, p = 0.009) and dominant models (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.04-1.21, p = 0.004 for TT + CT vs. CC). Moreover, in the subgroup analysis based on ethnicity, significant associations were observed in Caucasians but not in Asians. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis provided evidence that NQO1 rs1800566 genetic polymorphism was associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer and that the T allele probably acts as an important risk factor.
