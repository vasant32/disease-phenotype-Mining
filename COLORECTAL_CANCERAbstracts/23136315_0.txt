 BACKGROUND: Most physicians report routinely recommending colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, but many eligible patients are not screened. To better understand this finding, we explored the relationship between the content of hypothetical patient-physician CRC screening discussions and CRC screening rates in physicians' practices. METHODS: Semistructured interviews, including role-playing, with 24 primary care physicians explored their CRC screening approach with average-risk patients. Qualitative analysis examined physician-reported components of the CRC screening discussion, then compared findings between physicians with high (≥60%, n = 16) and low (≤45%, n = 8) CRC screening rates (based on HEDIS criteria). We conducted no statistical tests because of the small sample size and its exploratory aims. RESULTS: High screeners used dramatic language (eg, patient stories) and mentioned risk of death, disability, or surgery from CRC in screening discussion role-plays more often than low screeners. High screeners frequently offered fecal occult blood testing, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy as equally acceptable screening options. High screeners more commonly described solutions for overcoming CRC screening barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Encouraging providers to use risk-specific messaging about the consequences of CRC, offering screening option choices, and promoting a problem-solving approach to surmount barriers are potential strategies for increasing CRC screening rates.
