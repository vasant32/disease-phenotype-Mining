 BACKGROUND AND AIM: Capsule endoscopy (CE) for the stomach has not yet been in practical use. Likewise as in colon, CE for colorectal cancer screening, the less invasive nature of CE may be suitable for gastric screening. The aim of this study is to estimate a diagnostic yield of CE for gastric diseases. METHODS: This study involved 55 patients who participated in other clinical studies regarding obscure overt gastrointestinal bleeding or iron deficiency anemia. All patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy and CE within 2 weeks. Sensitivity and specificity of CE for diffuse and localized gastric lesions were calculated, respectively. RESULTS: Gastroscopy revealed 38 diffuse lesions (14 antral gastritis, 19 pangastritis, and 5 diffuse antral vascular ectasia) and 25 localized lesions (14 erosions, 2 cancers, and 9 polyps). CE had a higher sensitivity for gastric diffuse lesions compared with localized lesions. For diffuse lesions, sensitivity and specificity of CE were 70% and 82%, respectively. For localized lesions, sensitivity and specificity of CE were 28% and 63%, respectively. All cancers could not be detected by CE. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, the diagnostic yield of CE for gastric diseases is not high enough for gastric screening. Additional improvements including preparations, position change, or the invention of new technologies are required.
