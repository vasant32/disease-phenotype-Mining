 BACKGROUND: The laparoscopic resection of colorectal cancer (CRC) along with synchronous liver metastases has been attempted and reported in multiple single series. In this study, we aimed to examine the feasibility, procedural safety, and oncological integrity of 1-stage totally laparoscopic procedure for the radical resection of liver metastatic CRC in a head-to-head comparison with the 1-stage open procedure simultaneously. METHODS: The patients who underwent selective 1-stage concomitant resection of CRC and synchronous liver metastases between January 2004 and December 2008 (laparoscopy group, n=13) were retrospectively enrolled in the study. Patients receiving open 1-stage resection (laparotomy group) were retrospectively included at the ratio of 1:1 (n=13 out of 71), matching the laparoscopy group in sex, age, body mass index, site and stage of primary tumor, location and size of liver metastases, and adjuvant therapies. RESULTS: All the thirteen 1-stage laparoscopic procedures were successfully completed, without conversion to open procedure or additional incision. The operative duration of laparoscopic procedure was shorter than that of open procedure (313 ± 44 vs. 350 ± 46 min, P<0.05). The volume of blood loss was comparable between the 2 groups (259 ± 111 vs. 273 ± 95 mL, P>0.05). Patients undergoing laparoscopic procedure resumed off-bed activities, bowel movement, and oral intake earlier than those undergoing open procedure, and also had a shorter hospitalization stay (8.5 ± 1.9 vs. 11.2 ± 1.8 d, P<0.05). Only 1 clinically significant adverse event occurred in a patient who developed bile leak after the laparoscopic resection. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were comparable between the 2 groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: One-stage synchronous laparoscopic resection of liver metastatic CRC is a feasible, effective, and safe modality in specifically indicated patients, both accelerating postoperative recovery and shortening hospitalization time.
