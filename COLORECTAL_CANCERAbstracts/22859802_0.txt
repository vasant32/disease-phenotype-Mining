Traditional methods of investigating suspected colorectal carcinoma (CRC) such as barium enema, colonoscopy and computerized tomography (CT) pneumocolon are often poorly tolerated by frail or elderly patients. Comparatively, minimal-preparation CT (MPCT) is a non-invasive investigation that does not require bowel preparation. The aim of this study was to review MPCTs carried out at the Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, and compare findings with current published data. Retrospective analysis of 85 patients (age range 55-99 years) who underwent MPCTs at the Western General Hospital between May 2005 and June 2008 was undertaken. Results were followed up using clinical notes, pathological and surgical databases. Subsequent outcomes were analysed (average follow-up 22 months). The prevalence of CRC within the study cohort was 0.14. Sensitivity of MPCT was 1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-1) with a specificity of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.84-0.97). Thirty percent of patients were found to have extracolonic findings requiring further investigation or intervention. Of the patients, 4.7% had an extracolonic malignancy diagnosed on MPCT. MPCT is a sensitive and specific method of investigating CRC in the elderly, infirm or immobile. Our results were found to be comparable with that of current published data, validating the service provided at the Western General Hospital.
