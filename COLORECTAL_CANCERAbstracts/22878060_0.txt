INTRODUCTION: Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion (HIPEC) with oxaliplatin is increasingly used in patients with carcinomatosis from colorectal cancer. For reasons of chemical stability, oxaliplatin can only be administered in a dextrose (D5%) solution, and this causes peroperative glucose and electrolyte shifts. Here, we examined the influence of perfusion temperature on glucose and electrolyte transport, metabolic shifts, and surgical morbidity. METHODS: Patients with carcinomatosis underwent cytoreduction and HIPEC using oxaliplatin (460 mg/m(2) in D5%, open abdomen) during 30 min at 39°-41 °C. Intraperitoneal (IP) temperature was measured at three locations using thermocouple probes. The area under the temperature versus time curve (AUCt) was calculated using the trapezoid rule. The influence of perfusion temperature on surgical outcome was assessed using linear regression models and the Mann Whitney U test where appropriate. RESULTS: From July 2005 until March 2011, 145 procedures were performed in 139 patients with a diagnosis of CRC (70%), pseudomyxoma peritonei (11%), ovarian cancer (10%), or miscellaneous peritoneal malignancies (9%). Postoperative mortality and major morbidity were 1.4% and 26%, respectively. Higher perfusion temperature was related to more pronounced changes in serum glucose (P = 0.058), sodium (P = 0.017), and lactate (P < 0.001). The median duration of nasogastric drainage was 5 days, and this was unrelated to perfusion temperature (P = 0.76). The GI fistula rate and reoperation rate were 12.4% and 16.5% respectively; neither was related to perfusion temperature. CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing HIPEC with oxaliplatin, perfusion temperature exacerbates peroperative metabolic shifts but does not affect surgical outcome.
