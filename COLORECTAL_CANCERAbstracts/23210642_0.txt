In this study, we analyzed the protein expression of thioredoxin domain containing 9 (TXNDC9) in 116 colorectal cancer (CRC) cases. Among them, 97 were positive in CRC tissues and 60 were positive in normal mucosa. TXNDC9 expression in CRC was correlated with the extent of tumor invasion and the tumor size. TXNDC9-negative patients had longer lifespans. In vitro assays showed the significant suppression of CRC cell proliferation (P < .01) compared with two control groups; the number of invaded cells also decreased (P < .01). These findings suggest that TXNDC9 gene may function in cancer development and may be an effective target for inhibiting the growth and metastasis of CRC cells.
