Ezrin protein acts in the regulation of cytoskeletal and directly influences survival and tumor progression; there is an increase in its expression in metastatic cells and tissues in several types of cancer including colorectal cancer. 250 Patients with colorectal cancer submitted to surgery from 1995 to 2002. Protein expression was carried through by Tissue Micro Array immunohistochemical tests of paraffined neoplasic tissues and associated with clinical variables. Differentiation degree, lymph node invasion, metastasis at diagnosis, and palliative surgery were associated to a higher expression of the protein and survival. Higher expression of the Ezrin correlates with tumor aggressiveness and worse prognosis for colorectal cancer.
