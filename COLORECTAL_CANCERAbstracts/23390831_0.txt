The aim of this study was to assess the use of mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) and antimicrobial prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery regarding still existing controversies. A prospective study of 85 patients undergoing elective colon and rectal surgery during 2 years period was performed, divided in two groups. Group A (N = 46) with patients who underwent mechanical bowel preparation, and group B (N = 39) patients without mechanical bowel preparation. We analysed: gender, age, preoperative difficulties, diagnostic colonoscopy, tumor localization, operation performed, pathohystological findings, Dukes classification, number of lymphonodes inspected, liver metastasis, other organ infiltrations, mean time of surgery, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications and mortality. Demographic characteristics, pathohystological findings, the site of malignancy, and type of surgical procedure did not significantly differentiate the two groups. The only significance revealed in mean time of surgery (138/178 minutes) in favor of patients with MBP (p = 0.017). Mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) for elective colorectal surgery is not advantageous. It does not influence radicalism of the procedure, does not decrease neither postoperative complications, nor hospital mortality.
