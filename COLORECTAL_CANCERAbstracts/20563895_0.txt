INTRODUCTION: The liver is the most frequent site of metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC), and extensive liver metastases often cause severe secondary liver dysfunction. However, whether chemotherapy for metastatic CRC with severe liver dysfunction offers any clinical benefit is unclear since patients in this setting are typically excluded from clinical trials. DISCUSSION: We report herein a case of metastatic sigmoid colon cancer with severe liver dysfunction that was successfully treated using infusional 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX). FOLFOX was effective and well tolerated in the present case, and subsequent addition of bevacizumab to FOLFOX after disease progression was similarly feasible.
