 BACKGROUND: To investigate the feasibility of detecting methylated tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI2) and quantifying human long DNA with fluorescent quantitative Alu PCR in fecal DNA as a non-invasive screening tool for colorectal cancer (CRC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) was performed to analyze TFPI2 gene promoter methylation status in a blinded fashion in stool samples taken from 30 endoscopically diagnosed healthy controls, 20 patients with adenomas, and 60 patients with colorectal cancer. Real-time Alu PCR was used to quantify human long DNA. RESULTS: The specificity of fecal TFPI2 MSP assay and long DNA assay was 100% and 83.3%, respectively. The sensitivity of fecal TFPI2 MSP assay and long DNA assay was 68.3% and 53.3%, respectively. The sensitivity of fecal DNA assay (either marker being positive) was 86.7%, which was high for CRC. CONCLUSIONS: Our results have demonstrated the feasibility of using TFPI2 methylation and quantify human long DNA with fluorescent quantitative Alu PCR in fecal samples as a new noninvasive test for CRC.
