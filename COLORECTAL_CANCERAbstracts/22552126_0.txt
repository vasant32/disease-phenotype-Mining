 BACKGROUND: In Spain, an increase in the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) has been observed in both sexes in recent years, probably due to an improved diagnostic, the westernization of dietary habits, and worse obesity levels, among others factors. In this work, the CRC incidence rate trends in different health areas in Navarre (northern Spain) are studied during the 1990-2005 period. METHODS: An estimated incidence trend curve for each health area and the corresponding confidence bands were obtained for each gender using P-spline models. RESULTS: These results show an increasing trend of CRC in most of the areas in both sexes, being less pronounced in women than in men. In the central area of Pamplona (the capital) a decreasing trend has been observed for men during the period studied. CONCLUSIONS: Primary prevention is the best strategy to change the increasing trend observed in most areas of the province of Navarre. However, a healthy lifestyle has long-term results, so it is important to have an early detection program that would serve as a short-term prevention strategy.
