 AIM: The primary purpose of this questionnaire survey study was to determine the current status of colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in specialized Japanese referral centers before and after introduction of a government-approved advanced medical treatment system; and, secondly, to determine the current status of colorectal ESD in other Asian specialized referral centers. METHODS: A total of 1321 colorectal ESDs were performed in 11 institutions including two Asian centers outside Japan. RESULTS: Overall en-bloc resection, curative resection, R0 resection, perforation, delayed bleeding and emergency surgery rates were 95.4%, 89.1%, 87.2%, 2.9%, 2.5% and 0.2%, respectively. Similar clinical results were reported in the two Asian centers. CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences with regards to clinical results between the two periods although the perforation rate decreased from 3.3% to 2.4%. In addition, colorectal ESD has become increasingly standardized technically at specialized referral centers not only in Japan, but several other Asian referral institutions as well.
