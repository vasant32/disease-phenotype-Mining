 AIM: To determine the quantitative gene expression of KRAS codon 12 mutant, TACSTD2, Ku70 and SERIN1 in samples of tumor tissue and to relate them with clinical-pathological characteristics of colorectal cancer. METHODS: Samples of tumor and normal tissue of patients surgically treated for colorectal cancer between July 2005 and July 2009 were stored in a tissue bank. These samples were studied with the technique of real-time polymerase chain reaction in respect to expression of the following genes: KRAS codon 12 mutation, TACSTD2, Ku70, and SERIN1. RESULTS: Tumor samples of 37 patients were studied. The mean age was 65.5 years. Twenty one patients (56.8%) were male. Nine patients (24.3%) were classified as TNM stage I, 11 patients (29.8%) as TNM stage II, eight patients (21.6%) as TNM stage III and nine patients (24.3%) as TNM stage IV. The Ku70 expression in poorly-differentiated tumors is significantly higher than in well and moderately-differentiated tumors (2.76 vs. 1.13; p < 0.05). SERIN1, TACSTD2 and KRAS codon 12 mutation are not associated with clinical-pathological characteristics of colorectal cancer. CONCLUSION: Ku70 expression in poorly-differentiated tumors is significantly higher than in well and moderately-differentiated colorectal tumors.
