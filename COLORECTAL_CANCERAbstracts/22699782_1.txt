The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has a pivotal role in angiogenesis. VEGF levels appear to be influenced by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the VEGF gene. The aim of this study was to assess the importance of four VEGF SNPs in modulating susceptibility to colorectal cancer. We have genotyped 223 patients with colorectal cancer and 264 healthy individuals for the -2578C>A, -1498C>T, -634G>C and +936C>T VEGF SNPs using Taqman probes in polymerase chain reactions. The -2578 A, -1498 C and -634 G alleles were more frequently detected in CRC patients compared to healthy controls. Moreover, the haplotype -2578C/-1498T was less frequent in CRC patients while the -2578A/-1498C haplotype was significantly more frequent in patients compared to healthy controls. VEGF -2578C>A and -1498C>T SNPs and -2578/-1498 haplotypes appear to be associated with susceptibility to CRC.
