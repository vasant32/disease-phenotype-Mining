The aim of this study was to assess the applicability of autofluorescence (AF) spectroscopy as a method for the diagonosis of normal, benign and malignant of dysplasia in colorectal tissues experimentally. By improvement of optical design in laser pulse generator, wavelength-adjustable output was acquired and the optimal wavelength was defined as 380 nm. With 380-nm pulsed laser excitation, AF spectra of normal, benign and malignant colorectal tissues were recorded in the spectra region from 460-570 nm in vitro. The spectral analysis for discrimination among the different types of tissues was carried out using principal component analysis (PCA)-based Neural networks algorithm. The performance of analysis was pretty good with sensitivity, specificity and accuracy found to be 100%,90% and 96.7%, respectively. The AF spectroscopy may serve as an excellent tool for the evaluation of dysplasia in colorectal clinical diagnosis.
