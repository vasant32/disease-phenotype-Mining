Our aim was to examine whether systemic inflammatory response (SIR) is associated with perioperative central venous catheter-related bloodstream infection (CVC-RBSI) in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC) with administration of parenteral nutrition (PN). Between May 2002 and August 2009, 310 patients undergoing CRC surgery were enrolled. A CVC was inserted in all patients for administration of PN. Among these patients, 117 developed fever, and blood cultures for diagnosis of CVC-RBSI were obtained from them. A final total of 22 patients were diagnosed as having CVC-RBSI. Univariate analysis was performed to evaluate the risk factors for CVC-RBSI using the clinical characteristics of the patients. The results of univariate analyses revealed that only the Glasgow Prognostic Score was an independent risk factor for CVC-RBSI (odds ratio 3.733; 95% confidence interval 1.416-9.844; p=0.008). The Glasgow Prognostic Score is associated with CVC-RBSI in patients undergoing CRC surgery with administration of PN.
