 OBJECTIVE: To assess the acceptability of narratives to promote colorectal cancer (CRC) screening among members of an online weight loss community. METHOD: Members of online weight loss community completed an Internet survey in 2010. Multiple logistic regression models examined demographic and attitudinal correlates of interest in sharing and receiving CRC screening narratives. RESULTS: Participants (n=2386) were 92% female with mean (SD) age 58 (6) years; 68% were up-to-date with CRC screening. Among those who were up-to-date, 39% were interested in sharing their narratives with other members. African-Americans were more likely than other racial groups to be interested in sharing narratives (adjusted OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.14-3.57). Older, married members and those with greater CRC screening worries were less likely to be interested in sharing narratives. Among those not up-to-date, 63% were interested in receiving narratives from online community members, and those with higher perceived salience of CRC screening were more likely to be interested in receiving narratives (adjusted OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.31-2.65). CONCLUSIONS: Members of this online weight loss community expressed interest in sharing and receiving narratives for CRC screening promotion. Attitudes and demographic characteristics may predict successful recruitment of those who would share and receive narratives.
