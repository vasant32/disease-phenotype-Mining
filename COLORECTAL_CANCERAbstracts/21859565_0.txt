 BACKGROUND: We investigated the role of radiotherapy, including whole brain radiotherapy and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and prognostic factors in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) who developed brain metastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The data of 78 patients who received multidisciplinary treatment from 1996 to 2007 were reviewed. Overall survival (OS), intracerebral control (ICC), and local control (LC) were retrospectively analyzed. Six potential prognostic factors were evaluated: age, gender, number of brain metastases, extracerebral metastases, recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class, and interval from tumor diagnosis to radiotherapy. RESULTS: The median OS and ICC for the entire cohort were 8 and 6 months, respectively. Surgical resection-incorporating treatment resulted in significant improvement in OS (P = .036). On multivariate analysis, OS and ICC were significantly correlated with lack of extracerebral metastases (P = .024 and P = .041, respectively), lower number of lesions (P < .001 and P = .007, respectively) and interval from primary CRC diagnosis (P < .001 and .005, respectively) whereas RPA class I-II demonstrated significance only for OS (P = .045). SRS-incorporating therapy revealed a 1-year LC probability of 85%. No association between LC and any of the potential prognostic factors was observed. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that surgery can prolong survival in CRC patients with brain metastases. SRS-incorporating treatment provides excellent LC rates and should be considered for patients with 1-3 lesions. The strong association between survival and the prognostic factors identified in this study highlights a patient subset that may potentially benefit from new, more aggressive therapies.
