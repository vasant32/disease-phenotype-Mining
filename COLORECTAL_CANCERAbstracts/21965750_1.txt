 BACKGROUND: The leptin receptor is involved in modulating leptin activity, acting as a carrier protein. A link between leptin or leptin receptor and cancer development has been proposed and here, the hypothesis that leptin and its receptor might be implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression and invasion was investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 71 consecutive patients with CRC were enrolled in the study. Serum leptin and leptin receptor levels were evaluated by commercial ELISA kits. RESULTS: The multinomial logistic regression model showed a positive association of leptin and leptin receptor with advanced tumor stages, which was significant for the leptin receptor in stage IV of disease. CONCLUSION: High circulating levels of leptin receptor occur in patients with advanced stage of colon cancer, suggesting a role for leptin in cancer progression and aggressiveness.
