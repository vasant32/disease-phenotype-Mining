 PURPOSE: Fatty acid synthase is a common phenotype to various human cancers including those of prostate, colon, lung, endometrium, and stomach. Increased fatty acid synthase levels have been detected in serum from patients with breast and pancreatic cancer. In this study, serum levels of fatty acid synthase were measured in colorectal cancer patients at different stages of disease. METHODS: Consecutive 67 patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled in the study. Serum levels of fatty acid synthase were examined by ELISA test. The Kruskal-Wallis test and the Ï‡                            (2) method for trend have been used to analyze data. RESULTS: Serum fatty acid synthase levels of patients belonging to three groups of stage disease are statistically different. The patients with stage III and IV have significantly higher serum levels of fatty acid synthase than patients with stage I-II. There is a positive trend in serum fatty acid synthase levels from stage I-II to stage III and IV of disease. CONCLUSIONS: Fatty acid synthase levels are associated with the stage of disease in patients with colorectal cancer.
