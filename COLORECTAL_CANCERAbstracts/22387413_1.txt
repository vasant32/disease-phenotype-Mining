 INTRODUCTION: Portal hypertension is an unusual complication of liver metastases, which is frequently occurring in malignant disease. Portal hypertension may cause oesophageal varices and also stoma varices (colostomy and ileostomy). Oesophageal varices and bleeding from these varices have been frequently reported in literature. Stomal varices have also been reported in literature mostly associated with liver cirrhosis. These stomal varices lead to the massive bleeding causing morbidity and mortality. Portal hypertension is a pathological increase in portal pressure gradient (the difference between pressure in the portal and inferior vena cava veins). It is either due to an increase in portal blood flow or an increase in vascular resistance or combination of both. In liver cirrhosis, the primary factor leading to portal hypertension is increase in portal blood flow resistance and later on development of increased portal blood flow. It has been postulated that in liver metastasis the increase in portal flow resistance occurs at any site within portal venous system as a consequence of mechanical architectural disturbance. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report a case of a 64 year old gentleman who developed portal hypertension due to secondary metastases from colorectal cancer. He subsequently developed bleeding varices in his end colostomy. DISCUSSION: We believe that the combination of extensive metastases and chemotherapy induced portal hypertension in our patient. CONCLUSION: Our case and other literature review highlight that the recurrent bleeding stoma associated with colorectal cancer should be investigated for portal hypertension.
