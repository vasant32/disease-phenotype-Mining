Hypermetabolism, abnormal plasma amino acid profiles, increased gluconeogenesis, and changes in liver and muscle protein turnover are well-described undesirable effects in patients with cancer and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) The aim of the present study was to analyze the specific impact and interaction of these 2 disease patterns on patients' preoperative glucose and protein metabolism. Eight nondiabetic and 8 diabetic patients devoid of cachexia underwent a stable isotope infusion study on the day before surgery for colorectal cancer or adenoma with high-grade dysplasia. Protein and glucose kinetics were assessed in a fasted state by L-[1-(13)C]leucine and [6,6(2)H(2)]glucose. In diabetic patients, glucose metabolism was found to be elevated as the plasma glucose level increased (P = 0.013) and endogenous rate of appearance of glucose tended to be higher compared to nondiabetic patients (P = 0.083). Protein metabolism was not affected by the metabolic state of the 2 groups. Resting energy expenditure was higher in diabetic patients (P = 0.028). Under postabsorptive conditions, noncachectic patients with DM2 suffering from colorectal tumors showed an elevated turnover in glucose metabolism whereas the nondiabetic counterparts failed to demonstrate any metabolic changes due solely to malignancy.
