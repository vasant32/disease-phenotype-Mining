 BACKGROUND: The mortality rate of colorectal cancer ranks third behind lung and hepatic cancer in Taiwan. Colorectal cancer mostly arises from adenomatous polyps of left colon. The aim of our study was to examine the association of serum lipids with the histological pattern of rectosigmoid adenoma. METHODS: There were 2,506 eligible examinees aged 20 and above who underwent sigmoidoscopy as a screening examination in National Cheng Kung University Hospital between January 2003 and October 2006. They were classified into three groups: tubular adenoma (333 subjects), villous-rich (tubulovillous/villous) adenoma (53 subjects) and normal (2,120 subjects). We defined high total cholesterol (TC) as a level ≧200 mg/dl, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) as a level <40 mg/dL, and high triglyceride (TG) as a level ≧200 mg/dl according to the third report of the National Cholesterol Education Program expert panel on detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood cholesterol in adults. Adenoma histology was classified as tubular, tubulovillous and villous according to the proportion of villous part. RESULTS: Among the study population, 333 subjects (13.3%) had tubular adenomas and 53 subjects (2.1%) had villous-rich adenomas. The odds ratio (OR) for villous-rich adenoma in subjects with TG≧200 mg/dL compared to those with TG < 200 mg/dL was 3.20 (95% confidence interval [CI]:1.71-6.01), after adjusting for age, gender, general obesity, central obesity, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and alcohol consumption. If further taking high TC and low HDL-C into consideration, the OR was 4.42 (95% CI:2.03-9.63). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that subjects with high serum TG tended to have a higher risk of tubulovillous/villous adenoma in rectosigmoid colon. Therefore, reducing the serum TG level might be one method to prevent the incidence of colorectal cancer.
