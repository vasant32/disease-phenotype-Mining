The objective of this study was to clarify whether the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) are significant prognostic markers in patients with resectable colorectal cancer (CRC). A total of 200 patients who underwent curative resection for CRC were enrolled. The NLR and PLR were positively correlated (p < 0.001). Both the NLR and PLR were shown to be good prognostic biomarkers of overall survival (OS) (p=0.002 and p=0.001, respectively). The PLR was an independent prognostic factor of OS based on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 1.971; 95% confidence interval, 1.102-3.335; p=0.021).
