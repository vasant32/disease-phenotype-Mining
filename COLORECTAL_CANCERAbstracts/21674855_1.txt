 PURPOSE: We investigated the biological behavior of proximal and distal colorectal adenocarcinomas (CRC), intending to determine specific segmental differences, possibly arising from the distinct genetic pathways involved in their development. METHODS: Thirty-six proximal and 83 distal cancers were comparatively and retrospectively analyzed, regarding tumor stage, grade and Ki-67, p53 and Bcl-2 immunohistochemical expression. RESULTS: Proximal tumors were more likely to be poorly differentiated (p=0.005) and to exhibit low Ki-67 and p53 expression (<20% and â‰¤ 30% stained nuclei respectively; p=0.026 and 0.0014, respectively). Distal lesions were more likely to be moderately differentiated (p=0.001), to display moderate Ki-67 expression (20-50% stained nuclei, p= 0.013) and p53 staining higher than 30% stained nuclei (p= 0.0014). Such segmental variations regarding mainly p53 and to a lesser extent Ki-67 were seen within most of the specific sub-groups of patients (stratified by stage, grade, gender and age). An association between Bcl-2 expression and distal site was also observed among females (p=0.008). CONCLUSION: Proximal and distal cancers displayed different clinicopathological and molecular patterns, reinforcing the proposal that they are genetically and biologically different entities. Potential clinical applications of these findings should be investigated.
