 PURPOSE: The study was designed to investigate the clinicopathological correlations, relationship to apoptotic index, and prognostic significance of estrogen receptor beta expression in colorectal carcinoma. METHODS: The study was carried out on 40 patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer. The patients' data were collected prospectively and the 2 years overall survival was the endpoint. Estrogen receptor beta expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Apoptotic body index was calculated by counting apoptotic cells using the modified TUNEL assay. RESULTS: Estrogen receptor beta positivity was detected in 65% of colorectal cancer cases, while estrogen receptor alpha positivity was found in only 7% of cases. The rate of estrogen receptor beta immunoreactivity was significantly higher in low-grade colorectal tumors. The median apoptotic index in estrogen receptor beta positive cases was significantly higher than in estrogen receptor beta negative cases (6% versus 3%; p = 0.01). The median overall survival was higher in estrogen receptor beta positive cases (22 versus 18 months); however, the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The study results reinforce the importance of the estrogen receptor beta rather than the estrogen receptor alpha in colorectal cancer. Lack of estrogen receptor beta expression is associated with loss of differentiation and decreased apoptosis. Future studies should include validation of estrogen receptor beta as a prognostic marker and exploration of its role as a target in the management of colorectal cancer.
