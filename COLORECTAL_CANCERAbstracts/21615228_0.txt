 CONTEXT: FOLFOX6 and FOLFIRI regimens are often selected as the first- or second-line treatment for advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer. Patients are now able to undergo at-home treatment by using a portable disposable infusion pump (SUREFUSER(®)A) for continuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The duration of continuous 5-FU infusion is normally set at an average of 46 h, but large variations in the duration of infusion are observed. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: The relationship between the total volume of the drug solution in SUREFUSER(®)A and the duration of infusion was analyzed by regression analysis. In addition, multiple regression analysis of the total volume of the drug solution, dummy variables for temperature, and duration of infusion was carried out. RESULTS: The duration of infusion was affected by the coefficient of viscosity of the drug solution and the ambient temperature. CONCLUSION: The composition of the drug solutions and the ambient temperature must be considered to ensure correct duration of continuous infusion.
