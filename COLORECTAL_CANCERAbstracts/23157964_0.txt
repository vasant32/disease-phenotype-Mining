 OBJECTIVE: To study the anticancer effects of Baicalin on an orthotopic transplantation mouse model of mismatch repair gene deficient colorectal cancer. METHODS: Sixty orthotopic transplantation mice model of human colon cancer cell line HCT-116 expressing eGFP were established, which were divided randomly into negative controlled group (5% NaHCO3) and 50, 100, 200 mg/kg Baicalin groups. The nude mice were treated with intragastric infusion twice a day. Nude mice growth state, average weigh, inhibition rate of transplanted tumor, tumor metastasis and survival state were observed. RESULTS: At 14, 21 and 28 days after treatment with different dose of Baicalin, tumor growth velocity was significantly slower in the treatment groups, and tumor volume was significantly smaller than the controlled group (there were (832 ± 637), (2012 ± 1566) and (2494 ± 1557) mm(3) respectively in 14, 21 and 28 days) (F = 4.433, P < 0.05). At the end point of study, survival state of 100 mg/kg group (13/15) was superior to controlled group (8/15) and 200 mg/kg group (8/15) (χ(2) = 4.665 and 3.980, P < 0.05).However, there were no significant differences in tumor metastasis and tumor surface vessel density. CONCLUSIONS: Baicalin has statistically significant effects in inhibiting tumor growth in an orthotopic transplantation mouse model of mismatch repair gene deficient colorectal cancer, and 100 mg/kg may be an ideal treatment dose.
