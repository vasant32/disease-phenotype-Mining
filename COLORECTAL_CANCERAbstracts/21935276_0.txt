We tested the correlation between diabetes and aggressiveness of colorectal polyps in diabetic patients and matched non-diabetic controls. We retrospectively studied 3,505 type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients without gastrointestinal symptoms who underwent colonoscopy for colorectal cancer at Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea from August 1995 to August 2009. We matched 495 non-diabetic subjects with colon polyps to the diabetic patients in whom polyps were detected by year of colonoscopy, age, sex and body mass index (BMI). Among the 3,505 T2DM patients screened, 509 were found to have 1,136 colon polyps. Those with diabetes had a greater proportion of adenomatous polyps (62.8% vs 53.6%) compared to the control. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified DM, male gender, age and BMI as independent risk factors for multiple polyps (more than three polyps). Polyp multiplicity in diabetic patients was significantly associated with male gender (OR 2.360, P = 0.005), age (OR 1.033, P = 0.005) and BMI (OR 1.077, P = 0.028). Neither aspirin nor metformin use affected either size or number of polyps in diabetic patients. Male patients older than 65 yr with T2DM and BMI greater than 25 have increased risk for multiple adenomatous polyps and should be screened with colonoscopy to prevent colorectal cancer.
