John Cunningham virus (JCV) encodes an oncogenic T-antigen, which is capable of interacting with key growth regulatory pathways. JCV definite role as causal agent of human cancer, still awaits final confirmation. The present study was conducted to assess the possible role of JCV in Egyptian colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and correlate the expression with the clinicopathological features and survival. JCV in situ hybridization (ISH) signals and large T antigen immunoreactivity were examined in 87 colonic specimens. Positive glandular JCV ISH signals were detected in 20%, 25% and 40% of normal, adenoma and CRC cases respectively. Stromal JCV ISH signals were identified in 26% of CRC cases and 5% of adenoma however, normal mucosa did not show stromal positivity with significant difference (p = 0.03). Glandular JCV expression was significantly associated with high grade (p = 0.03), high mitotic index (p=0.02) and low apoptotic index (p = 0.00). Positive stromal signals were significantly associated with low apoptosis (p = 0.00). No positive nuclear immunostaining of JCV large T antigen was detected in all specimens. JCV stromal expression was the 2nd most powerful indicator of short survival and bad prognosis (p = 0.03) in CRC patients. JCV might play an etiological role in CRC tumorogenesis and short survival in Egyptian CRC patients.
