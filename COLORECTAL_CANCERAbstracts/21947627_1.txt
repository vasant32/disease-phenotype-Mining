 BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study is to examine the effect of systemic chemotherapy after the 1st-stage hepatectomy (CT×2) on the progression of disease and dropout rates. A major pitfall of the 2-stage hepatectomy procedure is a high dropout rate after the 1st-stage hepatectomy due to progression of disease (PD). Routine use of CT×2 has been advocated. METHODS: A total of 47 patients with multiple, bilateral unresectable liver metastases were selected for a 2-stage hepatectomy procedure (±portal vein occlusion). RESULTS: Of the total, 37 patients (78.7%) underwent systemic chemotherapy before the 1st-stage hepatectomy (CT×1) and 25 patients (53.2%) underwent CT×2; PD was significantly more common during CT×2 than during CT×1 (P=.002). Of the 47 patients planned for the 2nd-stage hepatectomy, 36 (76.6%) completed the procedure. Of these 47 patients, 25 (53.2%) showed PD after the 1st-stage hepatectomy, 12 in the CT×2 group and 13 in the no-CT×2 group; administration of CT×2 did not significantly affect the PD rate (P=.561). The overall dropout rate was 23.4% (n=11 patients): 16% in the CT×2 group vs. 31.8% in the no-CT×2 group (P=.303). CONCLUSIONS: The routine use of chemotherapy between the 1st- and 2nd-stage hepatectomy does not guarantee lower PD and dropout rates.
