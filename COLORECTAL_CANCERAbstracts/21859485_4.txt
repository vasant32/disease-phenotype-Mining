 BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the responsiveness of the European Organization for Research and Treatment (EORTC) quality of life questionnaires (QLQ-C30, QLQ-CR38) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-colorectal version 4 questionnaire (FACT-C). METHOD: This prospective study included 127 patients with colorectal cancer: 71 undergoing chemotherapy and 56 radiation therapy. Responsiveness statistics included the Standardized Response Mean (SRM) and the Effect Size (ES). The patient's overall assessment of his/her change in state of health status was the reference criterion to evaluate the responsiveness of the QoL questionnaires. RESULTS: 34 patients perceived their health as stable and 17 as improved between the first and the fourth courses of chemotherapy. 21 patients perceived their health as stable and 22 as improved between before and the last week of radiotherapy.The responsiveness of the 3 questionnaires differed according to treatments. The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire was more responsive in patients receiving chemotherapy, particulary functional scales (SRM > 0.55). The QLQ-CR38 and the FACT-C questionnaires provided little clinically relevant information during chemotherapy or radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire appears to be more responsive in patients receiving chemotherapy.
