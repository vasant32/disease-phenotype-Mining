 BACKGROUND: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of adenosine triphosphate-based chemotherapy response assay (ATP-CRA)-guided neoadjuvant chemotherapy for increasing resectability in patients with unresectable colorectal liver metastasis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomised into two groups: Group A was treated by conventional chemotherapy regimen and Group B was treated by chemotherapy regimen according to the ATP-CRA. Three chemotherapeutic agents (5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and irinotecan) were tested by ATP-CRA and more sensitive agents were selected. Either FOLFOX or FOLFIRI was administered. Between Group A and B, treatment response and resectability were compared. RESULTS: Between November 2008 and October 2010, a total 63 patients were randomised to Group A (N=32) or Group B (N=31). FOLFOX was more preferred in Group A than in Group B (26 out of 32 (81.3%) vs 20 out of 31 (64.5%)). Group B showed better treatment response than Group A (48.4% vs 21.9%, P=0.027). The resectability of hepatic lesion was higher in Group B (35.5% vs 12.5%, P=0.032). Mean duration from chemotherapy onset to the time of liver resection was 11 cycles (range 4-12) in Group A and 8 cycles (range 8-16) in Group B. CONCLUSION: This study showed that tailored-chemotherapy based on ATP-CRA could improve the treatment response and resectability in initially unresectable colorectal liver metastasis.
