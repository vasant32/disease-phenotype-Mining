The lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) in Lynch syndrome (LS) carriers is very high. To determine the impact of colonoscopic screening in 54 male and 98 female MSH2 mutation carriers, outcomes were compared with 94 males and 76 females who were not screened. CRC incidence and survival in the screened group were compared to that expected, derived from the non-screened group. To correct for survivor bias, controls were matched for age at entry into screening and also for gender. In males, median age to CRC was 58 years, whereas expected was 47 years (p = 0.000), and median survival was 66 years vs 62 years (p = 0.034). In screened females, median age to CRC was 79 years compared to 57 years in the non-screened group (p = 0.000), and median survival was 80 years compared with expected of 63 years (p = 0.001). Twenty percent of males and 7% of females developed an interval CRC within 2 years of previous colonoscopy. Although colonoscopic screening was associated with decreased CRC risk and better survival, CRCs continued to occur. CRC development may be further reduced by decreasing the screening interval to 1 year and improving quality of colonoscopy.
