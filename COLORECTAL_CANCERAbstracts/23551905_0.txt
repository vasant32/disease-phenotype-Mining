Recently, the incidence of colorectal cancer has been increasing, associated with obesity and diabetes. We have found that type 2 diabetes model KK-A(y) mice develop tumors within a short period by azoxymethane (AOM) treatment. However, factors that contribute to the promotion of carcinogenesis have not been clarified. Therefore, we looked at the genetic background of KK-A(y) , including two genetic characteristics of KK mice and C57BL/6J-Ham-A(y) /+ (A(y) ) mice, compared with other non-obese and non-diabetic mouse strains C57BL/6J and ICR, and induced colorectal premalignant lesions, aberrant crypt foci (ACF), and tumors using AOM (150 μg/mouse/week for 4 weeks and 200•μg/mouse/week for 6 weeks, respectively). The mice with a diabetes feature, KK-A(y) and KK, developed significantly more ACF, 67 and 61 per mouse, respectively, while ICR, A(y) and C57BL/6J developed 42, 24 and 18 ACF/mouse, respectively at 17 weeks of age. Serum insulin and triglyceride levels in KK-A(y) and KK mice were quite high compared with other non-diabetic mouse strains. Interestingly, KK-A(y) mice favor developing colorectal tumors (2.7 ± 2.3 tumor/mouse) over KK mice (1.2 ± 1.1 tumor/mouse) at 25 weeks of age, in spite of similar diabetic conditions. Both colon cancers that developed both in KK-A(y) and KK mice showed similar activation of β-catenin signaling. However, mRNA levels of inflammatory factors related to the activation of macrophages were significantly higher in colorectal cancer of KK-A(y) than in KK. These data indicate that factors such as insulin resistance and dyslipidemia observed in the obese and diabetics could be involved in the susceptibility of colorectal carcinogenesis. In addition, increase of tumor-associated macrophages may play important roles in the stages of promotion of colorectal cancer.
