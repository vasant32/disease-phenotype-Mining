Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in the lateral position has been the standard surgical approach for posterior mediastinal tumors. Herein, we report the successful thoracoscopic resection of a posterior mediastinal tumor with the patient in the prone position. The patient was a 62-year-old man with a posterior mediastinal mass. We were able to completely extirpate the posterior mediastinal tumor by means of thoracoscopic resection, with the patient in the prone position, much in the manner of solo surgery. The prone position has the potential to become the standard thoracoscopic surgical approach for posterior mediastinal tumors because it provides excellent exposure of the posterior mediastinum.
