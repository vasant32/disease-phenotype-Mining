We present the case of a 63 year-old woman without any family cancer background, who after having properly followed the cancer screening program for mild risk population, was diagnosed with colorectal cancer (stage IV) 3 years after a clear colonoscopy. This entity is known as interval colorectal cancer (diagnosed between correct screening periods). The colorectal cancer screening strategies and the specialized multidisciplinary units are experiencing important changes. Doctors involved in the screening programs and the follow up of neoplastic lesions (benign and malignant) are increasing. In reference to this case, we must analyze some of the limitations of the colonoscopy in detecting colorectal cancer, and we also review the quality criteria of colonoscopies. These must be remembered in daily practice.
