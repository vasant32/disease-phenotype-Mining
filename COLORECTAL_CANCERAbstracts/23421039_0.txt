The aim of the study was the evaluation of the plasma total antioxidant status (TAS) in persons with the neoplastic disease: colorectal or breast cancer in the relation to the smoking habit. Material and methods: the cancer group: 72 persons with the colorectal (n=30) or breast cancer (n=42), the control group: 62 healthy persons. In cancer group 16 persons were smokers, in the control group also 16 persons were smokers. The plasma total antioxidant status was measured by colorimetric method with the use of Randox Total Antioxidant Status (TAS) kit. Results: in the control group TAS concentration was significantly lower in smokers than in nonsmokers whereas in the cancer group the difference was nonsignificant. TAS level in the cancer group was decreased when compared to the controls. TAS concentration was lower in the nonsmoking cancer patients than in the nonsmoking controls. TAS level in nonsmoking cancer subgroup was similar to that in the smoking controls. Conclusion: cigarette smoking in healthy persons and the neoplastic disease in nonsmokers results in the decreased capacity of the plasma nonenzymatic antioxidants to the similar degree.
