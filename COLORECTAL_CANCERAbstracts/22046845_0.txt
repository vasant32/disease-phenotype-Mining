 PURPOSE: We sought to assess factors related to colorectal cancer (CRC) screening adherence among immigrant, Hispanic women in Harlem, New York City. METHOD: Adherence for colonoscopy and fecal occult blood test (FQBT) screening was measured among 255 women based on self-reported screening behaviors using American Cancer Society guidelines. RESULTS: Univariate results showed that age, language of the interview (English/Spanish), years in the United States, physician recommendation for either test, marital status (living alone/living with someone), and mammography adherence were associated with CRC screening adherence (p's < .05). In the multivariate analysis, having an age greater than 65 years, being interviewed in Spanish, having lived in the United States longer, having a regular doctor and a physician recommendation, and being currently adherent for mammography were associated with higher CRC screening adherence. CONCLUSION: Among this sample, there proved to be differences between having ever been screened and adherence with a greater proportion of women having ever completed either colonoscopy and/or FOBT compared to women who were adherent (72.9% vs 58.8%). Therefore, it is important to determine factors associated with adherence, not just screening utilization, in order to design strategies to increase adherence among immigrant Hispanic women.
