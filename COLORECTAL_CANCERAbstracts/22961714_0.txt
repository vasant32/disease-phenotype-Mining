Hepatic steatosis is a hallmark of chemotherapy-induced liver injury. We made serial (1) H MRS measurements of hepatic lipids in patients over the time course of a 24-week chemotherapeutic regimen to determine whether (1) H MRS could be used to monitor the progression of chemotherapy-induced steatosis. Thirty-four patients with stage III or IV colorectal cancer receiving 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid and oxaliplatin (n=21) or hepatic arterial infusion of floxuridine with systemic irinotecan (n=13) were studied prospectively. (1) H MRS studies were performed at baseline and after 6 and 24 weeks of treatment. A (1) H MR spectrum was acquired from the liver during a breath hold and the ratio of fat to fat+water (FFW) was calculated to give a measure of hepatic triglycerides (HTGCs). The methodology was histologically validated in 18 patients and the reproducibility was assessed in 16 normal volunteers. Twenty-seven patients completed baseline, 6-week and 24-week (1) H MRS examinations and one was censored. Thirteen of 26 patients (50%) showed an increase in FFW after completion of treatment. Six patients (23%) developed hepatic steatosis and two patients converted from steatosis to nonsteatotic liver. Patients whose 6-week hepatic lipid levels had increased significantly relative to baseline also had a high probability of lipid elevation relative to baseline at the completion of treatment. Serial (1) H MRS is effective for the monitoring of HTGC changes during chemotherapy and for the detection of chemotherapy-associated steatosis. Six of 26 patients developed steatosis during chemotherapy. Lipid changes were observable at 6 weeks.
