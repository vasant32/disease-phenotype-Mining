 BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) reduces the accuracy of liver imaging which may understage patients pre-operatively. Retrospective review of a prospective database to determine whether liver-specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) prior to pre-operative chemotherapy affects intra-hepatic recurrence and long-term outcome after hepatectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2003 and 2009, 242 patients with CRLM underwent a hepatectomy after â‰¥3 cycles of oxaliplatin or irinotecan-based chemotherapy. All had a liver-specific MRI immediately pre-operatively. The outcome of patients who had a liver-specific MRI prior to chemotherapy (PCI group, n= 92) was compared with those who did not (non-PCI group, n= 150). RESULTS: A liver-specific MRI pre-chemotherapy changed the staging in 56% of patients. At a median (range) follow-up of 55 (6-94) months, there was a higher incidence of intra-hepatic recurrence at a new site in the non-PCI group (65% vs. 48% in the PCI group, P= 0.041) and an increased rate of recurrence in patients with the same number of lesions pre- and post-chemotherapy [hazard ratio (HR) 2.02, 1:10-3.37, P= 0.024]. The non-PCI group underwent more repeat hepatectomies than the PCI group (24.7% vs. 13%, P= 0.034), achieving similar long-term survival. CONCLUSIONS: A liver-specific MRI prior to chemotherapy reduces intra-hepatic recurrence and avoids a repeat hepatectomy.
