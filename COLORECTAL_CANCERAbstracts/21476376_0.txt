Colorectal cancer represents a serious public-health problem in the United States, with important geographic differences and disparities of care evident in its detection and treatment. While effective screening tests exist, Connecticut lacks current data about rates of colorectal cancer screening. The Connecticut Department of Public Health commissioned Qualidigm, the federally designated Quality Improvement Organization, to conduct an analysis of 2008 fee-for-service Medicare claims data to determine screening rates. This article reports the findings of this analysis to increase awareness of opportunities for improvement in colorectal cancer screening and to highlight demographic and geographic variations that may require particular attention in Connecticut.
