 PURPOSE: The only drug that improves survival in hepatocellular carcinoma is sorafenib. FOLFOX-4 regimen is safe and widely used in patients with colorectal cancer, yielding interesting results with little toxicity. We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the safety and the effectiveness of FOLFOX-4 in cirrhotic or liver transplanted patients with hepatocellular carcinoma ineligible for sorafenib. METHODS: Thirty seven patients were enrolled in the study. The medical record of either cirrhotic patients or liver transplanted patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma receiving FOLFOX-4 regimen between November 1999 and March 2006 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients received oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2) as a 2-hour infusion on day one, and leucovorin 200 mg/m(2) as a 2-hour infusion followed by bolus 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m(2) and a 48-hours infusion of 5-fluorouracil 2400 mg/m(2). Treatment was repeated every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable adverse effects occurred. RESULTS: Patients had a Child-Pugh class A (n = 16), class B cirrhosis (n = 10) or a liver transplant (n = 11) and received 2 to 37 cycles of chemotherapy (total of 310 cycles). Two (5.4%) cirrhotic patients developed neutropenic sepsis and one (2.7%) toxic death occurred. At first assessment, five patients from Child-Pugh class A (33%) and two from Child-Pugh class B group (20%) achieved a radiological response and/or alpha foeto-protein decrease, and no patient achieved a complete response. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, with a manageable toxicity profile in cirrhotic Child-Pugh class A-B or liver transplanted patients, the FOLFOX-4 regimen appears to be a feasible treatment option for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma unfit for sorafenib. These data need to be confirmed in a prospective study.
