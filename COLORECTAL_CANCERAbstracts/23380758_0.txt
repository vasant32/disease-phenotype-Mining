Dysregulated expression of microRNAs (miRNA) is a hallmark of cancer. miR-16             has been reported to be downregulated and to act as a tumor suppressor in different             cancer types. In the present study, we sought to investigate the possible roles             and mechanisms of miR-16 and its relationship with p53 and survivin in CRC cells.             We showed that miR-16 was downregulated in 67% of CRC tissues and was correlated             with the degree of histological differentiation. Experiments in vitro showed that             overexpression of miR-16 inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis of             CRC cells through the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. We further showed that miR-16             repressed survivin expression at both the mRNA and protein levels and the survivin             gene was a direct target of miR-16. In addition, miR-16 reduced p53 expression             and p53 increased miR-16 levels, with downregulation of miR-16 targets survivin,             cyclin D1 and CDK6. Our findings suggest that miR-16 represses colorectal cancer             cell growth in vitro by regulating the p53/survivin signaling pathway. Our findings             provide further evidence for the involvement of dysregulated miRNAs in CRC, and             miR-16 could serve as a molecular target for CRC therapy.
