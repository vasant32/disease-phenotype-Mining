Somatic mutations in stool DNA are quite specific to colorectal cancer (CRC), but a method being able to detect the extraordinarily low amounts of mutants is challengeable in sensitivity. We proposed a hydrogel bead-array to digitally count CRC-specific mutants in stool at a low cost. At first, multiplex amplification of targets containing multiple mutation loci of interest is carried out by a target enriched multiplex PCR (Tem-PCR), yielding the templates qualified for emulsion PCR (emPCR). Then, after immobilizing the beads from emPCR on a glass surface, the incorporation of Cy3-dUTP into the mutant-specific probes, which are specifically hybridized with the amplified beads from emPCR, is used to color the beads coated with mutants. As all amplified beads are hybridized with the Cy5-labeled universal probe, a mutation rate is readily obtained by digitally counting the beads with different colors (yellow and red). A high specificity of the method is achieved by removing the mismatched probes in a bead-array with electrophoresis. The approach has been used to simultaneously detect 8 mutation loci within the APC, TP53, and KRAS genes in stools from eight CRC patients, and 50% of CRC patients were positively diagnosed; therefore, our method can be a potential tool for the noninvasive diagnosis of CRC.
