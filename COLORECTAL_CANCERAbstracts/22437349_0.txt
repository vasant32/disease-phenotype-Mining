The prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) is assessed through conventional clinicopathological parameters, which are not always accurate. Members of the human kallikrein-related peptidases gene family represent potential cancer biomarkers. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of human tissue kallikrein-related peptidase 10 (KLK10) by immunohistochemistry in CRC, to correlate this expression with various histopathological and clinical variables, and to evaluate its significance as a predictor of disease outcome. KLK10 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and a combined expression score was calculated for each case based on intensity and percentage of positivity. A statistically significant positive association was observed between KLK10 and tumor stage and liver metastases (p = 0.015 and p = 0.035, respectively). Paradoxically, a negative association was observed between KLK10 and tumor grade (p = 0.009). Kaplan-Meier survival curves and univariate analysis showed that both KLK10 expression and stage had statistically significant correlations with disease-free survival (DFS) (p = 0.030 and p < 0.001, respectively) and overall survival (p = 0.010 and p = 0.001, respectively). Cox multivariate analysis showed that both KLK10 expression and stage were independent predictors of unfavorable DFS (p = 0.057 and p = 0.001, respectively) and overall survival (p = 0.009 and p = 0.001, respectively). In conclusion, KLK10 immunostaining is an independent prognostic marker in patients with CRC.
