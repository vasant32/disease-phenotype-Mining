There has been much recent debate on the relationship between surgical volume and outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of a rural general hospital to provide care for patients with colorectal cancer in a small-volume practice. A retrospective review of patients treated in a rural general hospital, between January 1993 and December 2002, was undertaken. Patient demographics, disease characteristics, treatments and complications were all recorded. Ninety-eight patients had a final diagnosis of colorectal cancer. There was an equal male: female ratio and an average age of 69 years (40-88 years). Eighty-five percent underwent treatment with curative intent. The postoperative complication rate was low (2% wound infections, 2.3% anastomotic leak rate) and Dukes-specific five-year survival was satisfactory (A > 80%, B and C > 60%). In conclusion, this study adds weight to the argument that even with low-volume workload, satisfactory results can still be obtained.
