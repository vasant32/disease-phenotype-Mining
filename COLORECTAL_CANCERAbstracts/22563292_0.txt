 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the technical feasibility, clinical usefulness, and safety of a guiding sheath in fluoroscopic stent placement for patients with malignant colorectal obstructions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between June 2007 and January 2011, fluoroscopic placement of a dual colorectal stent was attempted in a total of 97 patients with malignant colorectal obstructions. A polytetrafluoroethylene guiding sheath was used in patients in whom a stent delivery system failed to reach the obstruction. Usefulness of the sheath was evaluated depending on whether the sheath could successfully assist the stent delivery system reach its area of interest. RESULTS: The guiding sheath was needed in 22 patients (15 men, 7 women; age range, 33-77 years; mean age, 59 years). The overall success rate for passing the sheath to the area of interest was 100%. There were no procedure-related deaths or major complications. The majority of the patients reported mild discomfort. In 2 of 22 patients with successful passing of the sheath to the area of interest, stent placement failed because of failure in the negotiation of a guide wire through the obstruction. CONCLUSION: Using a guiding sheath seems to be easy, safe and useful in fluoroscopic stent placement for patients with malignant colorectal obstructions.
