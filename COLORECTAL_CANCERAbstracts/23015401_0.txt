p63 is highly expressed in some malignant tumors and is associated with tumorigenesis, invasion and metastasis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical significance of p63 in colorectal cancer (CRC). p63 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in 66 CRC patients. Correlations between p63 expression and clinicopathological factors, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Among the 66 CRC cases, 31 cases (47%) exhibited a high score of p63 expression, while 35 cases (53%) were marked with a low score. The p63 level correlated with peritumoral deposits (p=0.021). The 5-year OS rates in the low p63 score and high p63 score groups were, respectively, 49% and 74% (p&lt;0.001). The 5-year PFS rates in the low p63 score and high p63 score groups were, respectively, 44% and 71% (p&lt;0.001). Univariate analysis revealed that p63 expression was correlated with OS and PFS. Multivariate analysis suggested that p63 expression was an independent prognostic factor for OS (p=0.035). In conclusion, p63 was negatively correlated with peritumoral deposits and positively associated with OS and PFS in CRC. The data suggest that p63 is a potential prognostic factor for CRC.
