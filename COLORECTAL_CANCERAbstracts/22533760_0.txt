Use of a Dual knife has become commonplace for endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) of colorectal tumors at Hiroshima University Hosipital. A Hook knife has been also used in combination with the Dual knife, depending on the location of the lesion. We have had recent opportunities to use a scissors-type SB knife Jr. We retrospectively compared outcomes of colorectal ESD performed with the Dual knife in combination with the SB knife Jr versus the Hook knife. In conclusion, although the Hook knife was shown to be a very useful auxiliary device for colorectal ESD, the SB knife Jr. yielded better results than the Hook knife in terms of complete en block resection and avoidance of perforation. Use of the Dual knife with the SB Knife Jr shows good potential for improving complete en bloc resection rate and safety of technically difficult colorectal ESD.
