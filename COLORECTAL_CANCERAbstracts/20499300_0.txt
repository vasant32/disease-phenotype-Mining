 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of simultaneous and staged resection for synchronous liver metastasis from colorectal cancer. METHODS: PubMed/Medline, ISI Web of Knowledge, Springer link, ebscohost, Elsevier Wiley Interscience, Google Scholar were searched for case-control studies concerning simultaneous versus staged resection of synchronous liver metastasis from colorectal cancer between January 1989 and March 2009. A meta-analysis was performed to analyze the morbidity and perioperative mortality. RESULTS: Seven case-control studies, with a total of 1390 patients of liver metastasis from colorectal cancer undergone curative hepatic resection, were reviewed. There were 495 simultaneous and 895 staged resections. Perioperative mortality was 1.1% in the staged resection group and 2.4% in the the simultaneous group, the difference was statistically significant[Peto OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.29-8.93, P=0.01]. No significant difference was found in morbidity between two groups[OR(random)0.88, 95% CI 0.51-1.51, P=0.64]. CONCLUSION: Selective staged resection is safe for synchronous liver metastasis from colorectal cancer.
