 BACKGROUND: Although chemotherapy-related hepatic injury has been reported in colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) patients, the morphologic changes caused by chemotherapeutic agents and the effect of chemotherapy on postoperative outcome remain ill-defined. A comprehensive review of the morphologic changes in the post-chemotherapy non-neoplastic liver was performed and the clinical effect of preoperative chemotherapy in CRLM patients was analyzed. METHODS: Hematoxylin-eosin, Masson's trichrome and reticulin-stained slides from non-neoplastic livers obtained from 89 CRLM patients were analyzed, and the clinicopathologic features were correlated with the status of chemotherapy exposure. RESULTS: Histopathologic features of sinusoidal injury (sinusoidal dilatation, centrilobular perivenular fibrosis, parenchymal extinction lesions, small vessel obliteration, and hepatocyte plate disruption) were significantly more frequent in oxaliplatin-exposed livers (p<0.05). The extent of sinusoidal dilatation was positively correlated with increasing numbers of chemotherapy cycles (p=0.022). Abnormal preoperative liver function tests were more frequently seen (p<0.05) and postoperative total bilirubin was higher in the chemotherapy group (p=0.008). Postoperative morbidity was more common in the chemotherapy group (p=0.044). CONCLUSIONS: Sinusoidal injury is frequently seen in oxaliplatin-treated livers, and its presence, especially when extensive, should be documented in surgical pathology practice. The recognition of sinusoidal injury may provide helpful guidelines for surgeons in deciding the extent of hepatic resection.
