INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common type of malignancy encountered in the United States. A significant proportion of patients with CRC will seek emergency medical care during the course of their illness and treatment. BACKGROUND: Emergent presentations can be the result of either local tumor invasion, regional progression, or therapeutic techniques. Specific complications of CRC which present emergently include rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, and bowel obstruction. Less common issues encountered include malignant ascites, neutropenic enterocolitis, and radiation enteropathy. CONCLUSION: The care of CRC patients in the setting of an acute severe illness typically requires the joint efforts of the emergency medical team in consultation with surgical, medical, and radiation oncology. A high degree of suspicion for the typical and atypical complications of CRC is important for all clinicians who are responsible for the care of these patients.
