 BACKGROUND: This prospective analysis evaluated the effect of tumor KRAS status on efficacy of second-line panitumumab plus folinic acid/5-fluorouracil/irinotecan (FOLFIRI). METHODS: This phase 2, open-label, single-arm study enrolled patients with unresectable, measurable metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) after failure of first-line treatment with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. Patients received panitumumab 6 mg/kg plus FOLFIRI every 2 weeks until disease progression or intolerability. Tumor assessments per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) were performed by the investigators every 8 weeks from weeks 8-32 and every 12 weeks thereafter. KRAS status was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on DNA extracted from fixed tumor sections. Efficacy endpoints included objective response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Safety endpoints included incidence of adverse events (AEs). Endpoints were evaluated by tumor KRAS status. RESULTS: Of 116 patients enrolled, 109 patients with known tumor KRAS status received treatment; 59% had wild-type KRAS, and 41% had mutant KRAS. Fifteen patients (23%) with wild-type KRAS and 7 patients (16%) with mutant KRAS had a complete or partial response to treatment. Median PFS was 26 weeks (95% CI, 19-33 weeks) and 19 weeks (95% CI, 12-25 weeks) in the wild-type KRAS and mutant KRAS strata, respectively. Median OS was 50 weeks (95% CI, 39-76 weeks) and 31 weeks (95% CI, 23-47 weeks) in wild-type KRAS and mutant KRAS strata, respectively. Skin-related toxicities (86% of all patients) and diarrhea (74%) were the most common AEs. CONCLUSION: Panitumumab plus FOLFIRI numerically improved objective response rate, PFS, and OS in favor of patients with wild-type KRAS tumors. The safety profile was consistent with panitumumab plus FOLFIRI trials in similar patient populations.
