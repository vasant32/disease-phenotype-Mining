 BACKGROUND: The enhanced recovery program (ERP) aims to reduce the metabolic response to surgery, hastening recovery and shortening hospital stay. Concerns exist regarding morbidity and hospital stay in elderly patients. The present study aimed to compare the outcomes and compliance of elderly patients managed by an ERP protocol with a younger group. METHODS: A review was performed of a prospective database of patients undergoing colorectal resection managed under the ERP protocol between 2005 and 2010. Patients were grouped into <80 years and ≥ 80 years, and perioperative data were collated. The postoperative outcomes were compared with the goals set out by the ERP protocol. RESULTS: A total of 688 patients were included, 558 were <80 years (median: 66 years; range: 17-79 years) and 130 were ≥ 80 years (median: 83 years; range: 80-95 years). Some 96% of operations were planned laparoscopically. Median total length of hospital stay was 6 days (range: 1-108 days) for the <80 year group and 8 days (range: 1-167 days; P 0.363) for the elderly group, with a 30 day readmission rate of 8.6% for the population and no significant differences between groups. The 30 day mortality was 5%, with a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.0001). Differences in protocol adherence were identified in the discontinuation of intravenous fluids, catheter removal, and early mobilization. CONCLUSIONS: An enhanced recovery program is feasible for colorectal surgery patients ≥ 80 years of age, with similar compliance as the younger group to some aspects of the protocol and an acceptable readmission rate. Attention to improving compliance in the postoperative phase is necessary, particularly in such high-risk patients, as such improvement may reduce the morbidity and mortality.
