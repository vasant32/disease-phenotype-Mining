 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Increased thromboembolic events are well known in patients suffering from malignant diseases. In the following pilot study, we investigated the usefulness of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) as a possible prognostic marker in patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC). METHODS: Plasma FVIII levels were measured in 79 patients with CRC, correlated with tumor characteristics, and compared with normal ranges of blood group (BG) 0 and BG A/AB/B and with 19 control patients. RESULTS: In CRC patients mean FVIII levels were elevated compared with controls (BG 0: p=0.283, BG A/AB/B: p=0.001) and normal ranges. Interestingly, mean FVIII levels varied significantly in different blood groups (p=0.002). UICC stage I CRC patients presented with mean FVIII plasma levels within normal ranges, whereas UICC stage II-IV CRC patients presented with elevated FVIII plasma levels. In BG A/AB/B a significantly elevated FVIII level was found in G2 compared with G1 tumors (p< 0.001). Patients with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen also showed significantly elevated FVIII levels (p=0.050). FVIII levels at time of surgery did not correlate with survival within the first 2 years following surgery. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, we demonstrated that FVIII plasma levels are elevated in patients with CRC and affected by T-stage and differentiation of the tumor. Whether FVIII is a clinical useful marker needs to be tested in a larger cohort.
