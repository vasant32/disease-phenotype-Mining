Anti-angiogenic therapy became a standard care of advanced colorectal cancer. Since the most frequent genetic alteration of colorectal cancer is KRAS mutation we have analyzed its effect on the efficacy of Avastin treatment. Since 2008 we have determined the KRAS status of 575 patients with colorectal carcinoma using a sensitive screening method and sequencing. In our database the frequency of KRAS mutation in colorectal cancer is 37% (codon 12: 31% followed by codon 13: 6%). We have examined the effect of KRAS status on the efficacy of Avastin treatment in 35 patients. Progression-free survival of KRAS mutant patients was highly similar to that of wild-type patients using log-rank test (9.2+/-5.5 months versus 8.7+/-5.7 months, respectively). Our data support those observations that KRAS status of colorectal cancer does not interfere with the efficacy of Avastin treatment.
