Among the secretory phospholipase A2s (sPLA2), sPLA2 group X (PLA2GX) has the most potent hydrolyzing activity toward phosphatidylcholine, and has recently been shown to be implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases. The aim of the present study was to investigate PLA2GX expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) and its correlation with patient clinicopathological features. The present study comprises a series of 158 patients who underwent surgical resection for primary CRC. PLA2GX expression in CRC tissues was examined by immunohistochemistry and compared with patient clinicopathological findings and survival. A total of 64% of the tumors expressed PLA2GX at high levels. Statistical analysis revealed that PLA2GX expression was inversely correlated with hematogenous metastasis (P=0.005). In the subgroup analysis, left-sided tumors with high PLA2GX expression showed an inverse correlation with lymph node metastasis (P=0.018) and hematogenous metastasis (P=0.017). Patients with high PLA2GX expression tended to have a longer disease-specific survival compared with those with low PLA2GX expression in left-sided, but not right-sided, CRC (P=0.08). In light of the present results, we suggest that PLA2GX has an inhibitory effect on the progression of CRC.
