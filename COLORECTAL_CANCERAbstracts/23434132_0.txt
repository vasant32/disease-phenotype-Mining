In the course of our ongoing efforts to develop novel quercetin conjugates with enhanced stability profiles, we introduced an isopropyloxycarbonylmethoxy (POC) group to 7-OH and/or 3-OH of quercetin and prepared three novel quercetin conjugates. The quercetin-POC conjugates were stable up to 96h in PBS but slowly hydrolyzed with half-lives of 1-54h in cell-free culture medium, which is reminiscent of the stability profiles of the previously reported quercetin-POM (pivaloxymethyl) conjugates. However, the quercetin-POC conjugates were more susceptible to passive transport, intracellular hydrolysis, and metabolism in breast cancer (MCF-7) cell line compared with their POM congeners to result in low concentration of quercetin in this cell line and thereby low antiproliferative effect. In contrast, upon incubation with colorectal carcinoma HCT116 cells, the quercetin-POC conjugates were shown to undergo slow hydrolysis and metabolism to maintain concentrations of the active quercetin species high enough to exert enhanced cytotoxicity. Taken together, the quercetin-POC conjugates synthesized in this study exhibited cell type-specific stability as well as bioactivity profiles, which warrants further investigation into the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic potential.
