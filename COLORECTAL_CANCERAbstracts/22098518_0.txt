Surgical techniques and technologies are rapidly evolving. In the field of colorectal surgery the transanal video-assisted approach was introduced by Buess, 30 years ago, with transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM). In more recent years different techniques and technologies have been proposed, including natural orifice specimen extraction (NOSE), natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and single-access surgery. Furthermore, a better understanding of the prognostic and risk factors of rectal cancer has allowed TEM to expand its indications to local resection of selected tumours, and more recently there have been proposals for sentinel node biopsy in colon and rectal cancer.
