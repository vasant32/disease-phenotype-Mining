Were made calculations of the Moscow population that needs screening for colorectal cancer (CRC). In screening will be needed about 2.7 million people--with high risk of colorectal cancer--300 thousand, and at average risk--2.4 million. It is expected that during screening for colorectal cancer would be detected at 1%, i.e. approximately 26 700 people, and 10% (267 000)--adenomatous polyps that can be removed. Since the organization and conduct screening of the adult population of Moscow to the CRC requires large additional economic costs, endoscopic equipment and expertise, this program can be divided into different stages. The first stage should be to conduct a population-based study of MUSE (see, L.B. Lazebnik, et al. in this issue) in all administrative districts of Moscow. The next stage should be planned implementation of annual preventive endoscopic examinations of the population in accordance with formed risk groups. This program will significantly reduce the incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer in Moscow.
