Single nucleotide polymorphisms in vascular endothelial growth factor gene VEGF, 1498C/T and 936 C/T are associated with colorectal cancer. We sought to determine whether such genetic variability in VEGF contributes to susceptibility of colorectal adenoma (CRA), a presumably precancerous state of colorectal cancer. In this research, two aforementioned polymorphisms were investigated for CRA susceptibility in a Chinese case-control study. The epidemiological risk factors were collected through questionnaire. The plasma VEGF levels were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The Taqman-Probe assay was used to determine genotypes in 224 CRA patients and 200 CRA-free controls. The clinicopathological data of each sample were collected for further correlation analysis. According to data analysis males, cigarette smokers, patients who carry metabolic syndrome or familial antecedent of adenomas were significantly associated with CRA risk. Plasma VEGF levels of CRA patients were higher than those of controls (P = 0.003). This difference is independent of genotypes. The carriers with 936CT and CT+TT had higher risk of CRA in comparison with controls (CT vs. CC, OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.23-3.25, P = 0.006; CT+TT vs. CC, OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.28-3.26, P = 0.003). 936-T allele was associated with increased risk of CRA (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.25-2.91, P = 0.003). Both CRA and control show no difference in the genotype of 1498C/T and the allele frequency of C-/T-. CRA patients with haplotype 1498T+936T presented significantly higher risk than those with wild-type 1498T+936C. Moreover, patients carrying 936CT+TT and 936-T allele demonstrated a tendency for villous adenoma. CRA patients have elevated plasma VEGF levels. The VEGF 936C/T polymorphism and 1498T+936T haplotype were found to be associated with increased CRA susceptibility.
