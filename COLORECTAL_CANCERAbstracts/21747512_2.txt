The capabilities of using gold nanoparticle based surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to obtain blood serum biochemical information for non-invasive colorectal cancer detection were presented in this paper. SERS measurements were performed on two groups of blood serum samples: one group from patients (n = 38) with pathologically confirmed colorectal cancer and the other group from healthy volunteers (control subjects, n = 45). Tentative assignments of the Raman bands in the measured SERS spectra suggested interesting cancer specific biomolecular changes, including an increase in the relative amounts of nucleic acid, a decrease in the percentage of saccharide and proteins contents in the blood serum of colorectal cancer patients as compared to that of healthy subjects. Both empirical approach and multivariate statistical techniques, including principal components analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were employed to develop effective diagnostic algorithms for classification of SERS spectra between normal and colorectal cancer serum. The empirical diagnostic algorithm based on the ratio of the SERS peak intensity at 725 cm(-1) for adenine to the peak intensity at 638 cm(-1) for tyrosine achieved a diagnostic sensitivity of 68.4% and specificity of 95.6%, whereas the diagnostic algorithms based on PCA-LDA yielded a diagnostic sensitivity of 97.4% and specificity of 100% for separating cancerous samples from normal samples. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves further confirmed the effectiveness of the diagnostic algorithm based on PCA-LDA technique. The results from this exploratory study demonstrated that gold nanoparticle based SERS serum analysis combined with PCA-LDA has tremendous potential for the non-invasive detection of colorectal cancers.
