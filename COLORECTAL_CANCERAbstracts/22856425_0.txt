 OBJECTIVE: Stage I colorectal carcinomas display a highly variable behavior which is not accurately predicted by the available prognostic markers. CD133 is considered a useful marker to identify the so-called cancer stem cells in colorectal cancers (CRCs) and its expression has been shown to have prognostic significance in CRC patients. This study aimed to verify whether immunohistochemical evaluation of CD133 might correlate with the progression risk of stage I CRC patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Expression levels of the CD133 molecule were analyzed and compared in two series of stage I surgically resected CRC patients showing disease progression and death for the disease and patients with no evidence of disease progression after at least 6 years after surgery. RESULTS: A positive staining for CD133 was detected in 52% of the cases with poor prognosis and only in 9% of the group with good prognosis, and this difference was highly significant (p < 0.001). A significant correlation was detected between CD133 expression and histological parameters, such as tumor budding, vascular invasion, and presence of lymph node micrometastases but not tumor grading, gender, and age. Disease-free survival and cancer-specific survival of CD133 negative tumors were significantly longer compared to positive cases. In multivariate analyses, CD133 staining confirmed to be a predictor of shorter survival independent from vascular invasion but not from lymph nodes micrometastases. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that CD133 immunostaining is a useful predictor of high risk progression in stage I CRC patients and might help to identify patients eligible for adjuvant chemotherapy.
