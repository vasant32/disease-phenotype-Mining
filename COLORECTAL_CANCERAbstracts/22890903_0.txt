We have analyzed the structures of glycosphingolipids and intracellular free glycans in human cancers. In our previous study, trace amounts of free N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac)-containing complex-type N-glycans with a single GlcNAc at each reducing terminus (Gn1 type) was found to accumulate intracellularly in colorectal cancers, but were undetectable in most normal colorectal epithelial cells. Here, we used cancer glycomic analyses to reveal that substantial amounts of free Neu5Ac-containing complex-type N-glycans, almost all of which were α2,6-Neu5Ac-linked, accumulated in the pancreatic cancer cells from three out of five patients, but were undetectable in normal pancreatic cells from all five cases. These molecular species were mostly composed of five kinds of glycans having a sequence Neu5Ac-Gal-GlcNAc-Man-Man-GlcNAc and one with the following sequence Neu5Ac-Gal-GlcNAc-Man-(Man-)Man-GlcNAc. The most abundant glycan was Neu5Acα2-6Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-2Manα1-3Manβ1-4GlcNAc, followed by Neu5Acα2-6Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-2Manα1-6Manβ1-4GlcNAc. This is the first study to show unequivocal evidence for the occurrence of free Neu5Ac-linked N-glycans in human cancer tissues. Our findings suggest that free Neu5Ac-linked glycans may serve as a useful tumor marker.
