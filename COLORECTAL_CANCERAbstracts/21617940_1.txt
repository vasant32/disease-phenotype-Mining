P73 is a structural and functional homologue of p53, and plays an important role in regulating cell cycle and apoptosis. A potentially functional polymorphism (designated as p73 G4C14-to-A4T14) has been identified in a region in exon 2 of the p73 gene, which may theoretically form a stem-loop structure and thereby affect p73 expression. Several investigations have reported the correlation between p73 G4C14-to-A4T14 polymorphism and cancer risk. However, the results are inconclusive. To further assess the association between p73 polymorphism and cancer risk, we performed meta-analysis of the data sets obtained from 26 individual studies involving 8,148 cancer patients and 8,150 controls. The association between p73 G4C14-to-A4T14 polymorphism and cancer risk was determined by crude odd ratios (OR) with 95% CI (confidential interval). AT-allele carriers were found to have a significantly increased risk of cervical cancer (AT/GC vs. GC/GC, OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.14-2.33; AT/AT + AT/GC vs. GC/GC, OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.05-2.10), colorectal cancer (AT/AT vs. AT/GC + GC/GC, OR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.25-3.12), head and neck cancer (AT/AT + AT/GC vs. GC/GC, OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.06-1.96) and other cancers (AT/AT vs. GC/GC, OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.24-2.57; AT/AT vs. AT/GC + GC/GC, OR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.26-2.56). In the stratified analysis of ethnicity, a significantly elevated cancer risk was found in Caucasians (AT/AT + AT/GC vs. GC/GC, OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.08-1.30; allele AT vs. allele GC, OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.06-1.24). No significant association of p73 polymorphism with the cancer risk of smoking was detected by stratified analysis by smoking status. Together, our data suggest that the p73 G4C14-to-A4T14 may be a risk factor of cancer especially in Caucasians.
