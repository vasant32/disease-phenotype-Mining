Colorectal cancer has a high cure rate if it can be detected early. Identifying and understanding the genes involved may enable early diagnosis and reduce mortality. The aim of our study was to investigate the correlation between the expression of ING4 and the pathological features in patients with colorectal cancer. We assayed ING4 protein expression levels in tumor samples from 97 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between January 2001 and January 2002. The patients received no other treatments except surgery. ING4 protein expression was downregulated in adenoma relative to normal mucosa and further reduced in colorectal cancer tissues. Furthermore, the suppression of ING4 expression was also related to the more advanced Dukes' stages. We observed that ING4 expression levels in patients with lymphatic metastasis were lower than those without metastasis. Together, our results indicate that ING4 play a role in colorectal carcinoma progression.
