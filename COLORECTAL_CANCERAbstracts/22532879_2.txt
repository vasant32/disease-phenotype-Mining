Colorectal cancer is a rapidly rising trend in Asia. The incidence in many Asian countries is on par with the West. Several studies have provided data regarding the survival of patients with colorectal cancer. In Asia, the overall cure rate of colorectal cancer has not improved dramatically in the last decade, 5-year survival remaining at approximately 60%. Colorectal cancer survival time has increased in recent years, but mortality rate remains high. Although studies have determined a number of factors that can predict survival of patients after diagnosis, life expectancy has not been increased dramatically. It seems that among the prognostic factors explored so far, the most important are those that relate to early diagnosis of cancer. Primary detection is feasible since efficient screening modalities are available. Colonoscopic surveillance is needed, especially in subjects at higher risk.
