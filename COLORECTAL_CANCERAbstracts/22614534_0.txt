Coagulation disorders often accompany cancer onset and evolution, which,             if not properly managed, could have grave consequences. Endothelial protein C             is an important regulator of homeostasis and acts through its high affinity binding             to its transmembrane receptor (EPCR). Soluble (sEPCR) which results from the proteolytic             cleavage of the membrane bound form can trap activated endothelial protein C and             deprive it of its anti-coagulant function. In this study, the expression of EPCR             and its soluble form (sEPCR) released into plasma as a result of proteolytic cleavage             were investigated in ovarian, breast, lung and colorectal cancer biopsies, as             well as in ascitic cell clusters and peritoneal fluid from ovarian cancer samples.             In parallel, breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer cell lines were investigated             for the expression of EPCR. The integrity of the EPCR gene sequence as well gene             haplotypes were ascertained in the established cancer cell lines in order to understand             their eventual regulatory functions. The results from the present study indicate             that in cancer patients, the levels of sEPCR are significantly higher than the             normal range compared to healthy volunteers. The increase in the levels of sEPCR             parallels the increase in CA125, showing a close correlation. Therefore, the detection             of sEPCR in cancer and during the post-treatment period could be taken into account             as an additional marker that could re-inforce the one obtained using CA125 alone             as a marker of cancer cell mass.
