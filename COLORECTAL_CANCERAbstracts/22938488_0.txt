The glutathione S transferase (GST) family is a major part of cellular defense mechanisms against endogenous and exogenous substances, many of which have carcinogenic potential. Alteration in the expression level or structure of the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) enzymes may lead to inadequate detoxification of potential carcinogens and consequently contribute to cancer development. A member of the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) family, GSTP1, is an attractive candidate for involvement in susceptibility to carcinogen-associated colorectal cancer. An A>G transition in exon 5 resulting in an Ile105Val amino acid substitution has been identified which alters catalytic efficiency. The present study investigated the possible impact of Ile105Val GSTP1 polymorphism on susceptibility to colorectal cancer. in Jordan We examined 90 tissue samples previously diagnosed with colorectal carcinoma, and 56 non-cancerous colon tissues. DNA was extracted from paraffin embedded tissues and the status of the GSTP1 polymorphism was determined using a polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method. No statistically significant differences were found between colorectal cancer cases and controls for the GSTP1 Ile/Ile, Ile/Val and Val/Val genotypes. The glutathione S-transferase polymorphism was not associated with risk in colorectal cancer cases in Jordan stratified by age, sex, site, grade or tumor stage. In conclusion, the GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism is unlikely to affect the risk of colorectal cancer.
