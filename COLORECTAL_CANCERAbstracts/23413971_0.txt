 BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy with vaccines is attractive for the treatment of cancer. This study is aimed at determining the effect of recombinant Salmonella (SL3261)-based 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL) vaccine on the development of colorectal cancers and the potential immune mechanisms in rats. RESULTS: In comparison with that in the PBS group, similar levels of 4-1BBL expression, the frequency of T cells, IFN-γ responses, and comparable numbers of tumors were detected in the SL3261 and SL3261C groups of rats. In contrast, significantly fewer numbers of tumors, increased levels of 4-1BBL expression in the spleens and colorectal tissues, higher frequency of peripheral blood and splenic CD3+CD25+ T cells, and stronger splenic T cell IFN-γ responses were detected in the SL3261R group of rats. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that vaccination with recombinant attenuated Salmonella harboring the 4-1BBL gene efficiently enhanced T cell immunity and inhibited the development of carcinogen-induced colorectal cancers in rats.
