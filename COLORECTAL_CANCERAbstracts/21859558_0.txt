The problem of the surveillance for colorectal cancer after radical surgery is a widely debated argument. Like for other solid tumors, the issue is divided in 2 main routes: the early diagnosis of recurrence and the early diagnosis of a second primary cancer. Genetic and molecular features have been recognized as useful tools to measure these risks, however, the instruments are still insufficient to design a personalized strategy for the patient. In an era of "tailored therapies" in oncology, even the follow-up of the surgically treated patient for colorectal cancer should enter "a tailor's shop in which several competent tailors" should be available to manage a complex problem.
