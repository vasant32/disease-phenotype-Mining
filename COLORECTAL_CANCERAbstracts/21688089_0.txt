The present analysis sought to determine the usefulness and validity of the Short Acculturation Scale for Hispanics (SASH) in assessment of acculturation among Hispanics participating in a colorectal cancer screening study. Primary data was collected from 2008 to 2009 through surveys in East Harlem community-based sites and health clinics among Hispanics. Bivariate correlations and independent samples t tests assessed SASH correlation with acculturation proxies and relationships between proxies, SASH, and sociodemographics. SASH was highly correlated with commonly used acculturation proxies; inter-scale correlations and alpha scores were high. Sociodemographics associated with proxy variables were associated with SASH. In conclusion, SASH is useful and valid for assessing acculturation among Hispanics; however, a shortened version or acculturation proxy variables could also be utilized.
