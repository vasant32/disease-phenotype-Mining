Recent studies have suggested that mRNAs transcribed from cancer/testis genes might be used as biomarkers of cancer cells migrating through the bloodstream. Using RT-PCR we evaluated the expression of several cancer/testis mRNAs (MAGEA1-6, GAGE1-8, NY-ESO-1, SSX1, 2, and 4, XAGE1 and MAGEC1) in primary tumors and peripheral blood samples of colorectal cancer patients. The detection rate of at least one of the transcripts was 95% (37/39 samples) for primary tumors and 81% (52/64 samples) for the peripheral blood. Moreover, selected mRNAs were detectable in cellular fraction of the peripheral blood at all stages the disease (14 out of 14 cases), whereas in extracellular fraction of plasma were found only at stages III and IV. Obtained data open a possibility of early diagnosis of colorectal cancer in people at high risk by peripheral blood analysis.
