Low band gap D-A conjugated PNs consisting of 2-ethylhexyl cyclopentadithiophene co-polymerized with 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (for nano-PCPDTBT) or 2,1,3-benzoselenadiazole (for nano-PCPDTBSe) have been developed. The PNs are stable in aqueous media and showed no significant toxicity up to 1 mg · mL(-1) . Upon exposure to 808 nm light, the PNs generated temperatures above 50 °C. Photothermal ablation studies of the PNs with RKO and HCT116 colorectal cancer cells were performed. At concentrations above 100 µg · mL(-1)  for nano-PCPDTBSe, cell viability was less than 20%, while at concentrations above 62 µg · mL(-1)  for nano-PCPDTBT, cell viability was less than 10%. The results of this work demonstrate that low band gap D-A conjugated polymers 1) can be formed into nanoparticles that are stable in aqueous media; 2) are non-toxic until stimulated by IR light and 3) have a high photothermal efficiency.
