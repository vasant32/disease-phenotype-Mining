Patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) carrying activating             mutations of the KRAS gene do not benefit from treatment with anti-epidermal growth             factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, KRAS mutation testing             of mCRC patients is mandatory in the clinical setting for the choice of the most             appropriate therapy. Co-amplification-at-lower denaturation-temperature PCR (COLD-PCR)             is a novel modification of the conventional PCR method that selectively amplifies             minority alleles from a mixture of wild-type and mutant sequences irrespective             of the mutation type or position within the sequence. In this study, we compared             the sensitivity of a COLD-PCR method with conventional PCR/sequencing and the             real-time PCR-based Therascreen kit to detect KRAS mutations. By using dilutions             of KRAS mutant DNA in wild-type DNA from colon cancer cell lines with known KRAS             status, we found that Fast COLD-PCR is more sensitive than the conventional PCR             method, showing a sensitivity of 2.5% in detecting G>A and G>T mutations.             The detection of G>C transversions was not improved by either Fast COLD-PCR             or Full COLD-PCR. We next analyzed by COLD-PCR, conventional PCR and Therascreen             52 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from mCRC patients. Among 36 samples             with >30% tumor cells, 8 samples were negative by conventional PCR, Therascreen             and Fast COLD-PCR; 20 mutations identified by conventional PCR were confirmed             by Therascreen and Fast COLD-PCR; 8 cases undetermined by conventional PCR were             all confirmed to carry KRAS G>A or G>T mutations by using either Therascreen             or Fast COLD-PCR. Conventional PCR was able to detect only 2 KRAS mutations among             16 samples with <30% tumor cells (12.5%), whereas Therascreen and Fast COLD-PCR             identified 6 mutants (37.5%). These data suggest that Fast COLD-PCR has a higher             clinical sensitivity as compared with conventional PCR in detecting G>C to             A>T changes in the KRAS gene, which represent >90% of the mutations of this             oncogene in CRC.
