Heterozygous mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes result in predisposition to colorectal cancer (HNPCC or Lynch syndrome). Patients with biallelic mutations in these genes, however, present earlier, with constitutional mismatch repair deficiency cancer syndrome (CMMRD) which is characterised by a spectrum of rare childhood malignancies and caf√©-au-lait skin patches. The hallmark of MMR deficiency, microsatellite instability (MSI), is readily detectable in tumour DNA in Lynch syndrome, but is also present in constitutional DNA of CMMRD patients. However, detection of constitutional or germline MSI (gMSI) has hitherto relied on technically difficult assays that are not routinely applicable for clinical diagnosis. Consequently we have developed a simple high throughput screening methodology to detect gMSI in CMMRD patients based on the presence of stutter peaks flanking a dinucleotide repeat allele when amplified from patient blood DNA samples. Using the three different microsatellite markers, the gMSI ratio was determined in a cohort of normal individuals and 10 CMMRD patients, with biallelic germline mutations in PMS2 (7 patients), MSH2 (1 patient) or MSH6 (2 patients). Subjects with either PMS2 or MSH2 mutations were easily identified; however this measure was not altered in patients with CMMRD due to MSH6 mutation.
