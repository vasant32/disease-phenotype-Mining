The initiation and development of colorectal cancer is closely associated             with the malignant transformation of colorectal polyps. The aim of this study             was to analyze the expression of the bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2), toll-like             receptor 3 (TLR3), TLR4 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) proteins in colorectal polyps,             adenoma and adenocarcinoma. An immunohistochemical streptavidin-peroxidase (SP)             method was used to examine the expression of MBP2, TLR4, TLR3 and COX2 in 20 colorectal             juvenile polyps and 15 colorectal polyps of hamartomatous polyposis obtained from             children, and 20 colorectal adenomas and 20 colorectal adenocarcinomas obtained             from adults. A comparison of the expression levels of TLR3 among the groups revealed             a gradual downward trend from the colorectal juvenile polyp group to the colorectal             hamartomatous polyposis, adenoma and adenocarcinoma groups, respectively. The             expression level of TLR3 was significantly lower in the colorectal adenocarcinoma             group (p<0.05). The expression levels of TLR3, TLR4 and BMP2 were significantly             different among the colorectal juvenile polyp, hamartomatous polyposis, adenoma             and adenocarcinoma groups. These three protein molecules may be significant in             the development and malignant transformation of colorectal polyps.
