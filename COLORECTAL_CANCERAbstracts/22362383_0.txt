Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and a major cause of cancer-related mortality. The lifetime risk to develop colorectal cancer is 6% in the Western world, and one third of the affected people will ultimately die from this disease. Colorectal carcinomas develop slowly over a period of several years. Therefore, identifying people with precancerous lesions holds the potential to reduce the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer. Apart from mutations and chromosomal imbalances, inactivation of tumor suppressor genes by DNA hypermethylation has been recognized as an important mechanism driving colorectal carcinogenesis. In recent years, screening tests have been developed that rely on the detection of DNA hypermethylation in remote media to identify people suffering from asymptomatic colorectal cancers at early stages. Apart from their diagnostic value, methylation markers hold the potential to be used as prognostic markers. Here, we summarize the recent development of DNA methylation markers for colorectal cancer in remote media with regard to their diagnostic and prognostic value.
