 PURPOSE: The published data on the association between xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD) Lys751Gln and Asp312Asn polymorphisms and colorectal cancer remained controversial. The present meta-analysis of literatures was performed to derive a more precise estimation of the relationship. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify all case-control studies of Lys751Gln and Asp312Asn polymorphisms on the susceptibility of different tumor site of colorectal cancer (colon, rectum, and colon/rectum cancer). A total of 22 eligible studies were selected for this meta-analysis, including 3,042 cases and 4,627 controls for Lys751Gln and 1,581 cases and 2,846 controls for Asp312Asn. RESULTS: Overall, no significantly elevated colorectal cancer risk was found in all genetic models when all studies were pooled into the meta-analysis (for Lys751Gln polymorphism: Lys/Gln vs. Lys/Lys, OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.90-1.14; Gln/Gln vs. Lys/Lys, OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.85-1.26; dominant model, OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.93-1.15; recessive model, OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.87-1.25; and for Asp312Asn polymorphism: Asp/Asn vs. Asp/Asp, OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 0.91-1.35; Asn/Asn vs. Asp/Asp, OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.87-1.47; dominant model, OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.94-1.26; recessive model, OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 0.88-1.41). And for the additive model, individuals carrying the 751Gln or 312Asn allele were not significantly associated with increased risk to colorectal cancer (OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.94-1.11, OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.95-1.20). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that XPD Lys751Gln and Asp312Asn polymorphisms may not be associated with colorectal cancer development.
