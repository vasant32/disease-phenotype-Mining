Even in the era of new anticancer drugs, an optimal treatment strategy for colorectal cancer associated with liver metastasis and peritoneal carcinomatosis has yet to be established. Here we report the case of a long-term survivor with very advanced colon cancer who underwent repeated resective surgery and chemotherapy. This 69-year-old man underwent a Hartmann's procedure and the resection of peritoneal metastases of cancer of the rectosigmoid, which had infiltrated the retroperitoneum giving rise to multiple liver metastases and peritoneal carcinomatosis. The resection margin was positive for cancer. After 14 courses of a modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6) regimen, a partial response with no development of new lesions was obtained. Multiple partial hepatectomies were subsequently performed. After the completion of an additional 6 courses of mFOLFOX6, a positron-emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) examination demonstrated a hot spot in segment 4. This hot deposit disappeared after a further 8 courses of mFOLFOX6. The patient then underwent a left lateral segmentectomy for a newly developed lesion in segment 3, which was detected 2 years and 7 months after the first operation. The patient has remained free from recurrence for 2 years since his last operation.
