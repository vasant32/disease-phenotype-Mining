PURPOSE: Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the western world. Little is known about patients undergoing liver transplantation (Ltx) due to liver metastases from colorectal cancer. This study aimed to explore individual patients' experiences having undergone this procedure as a treatment for liver metastases secondary to colorectal cancer. METHOD: Exploratory research methodology was used, whereby in-depth interviews with 9 patients were carried out 6 months after they had undergone liver transplantation. Median patient age was 56 years at the time of the surgery. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and qualitative content analysis was applied to the data. RESULTS: Three main themes emerged during the analysis phase. The first theme explored the informants' positive feelings about receiving experimental treatment that might prolong their life. The second theme related to the challenge presented by their feelings oscillating frequently between hope and despair. The final theme considered the strong wishes expressed by patients to live their lives as normally as possible thereafter. This last theme related in part to the patients' physical condition, side effects from medication and any relationships with loved ones. CONCLUSION: These findings offer new insight into the situation of patients undergoing liver transplantation due to liver metastases from colorectal cancer. In spite of the risks and side effects of major surgery and the transplant medication all participants expressed an overall view that having undergone liver transplantation was a very positive experience.
