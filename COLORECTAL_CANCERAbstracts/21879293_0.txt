A new sensitive method for multiplex gene-specific methylation analysis was developed using a ligation-based approach combined with a TaqMan-based detection and readout employing universal reporter probes. The approach, termed methylation-specific Ligation Detection Reaction (msLDR), was applied to test 16 loci in 8 different colorectal cancer cells in parallel. These loci encode immune regulatory genes involved in T-cell and natural killer cell activation, whose silencing is associated with the development or progression of colorectal cancer. Parallel analysis of HLA-A, HLA-B, STAT1, B2M, LMP2, LMP7, PA28Î±, TAP1, TAP2, TAPBP, ULBP2 and ULBP3 by msLDR in eight colorectal cancer cell lines showed preferential methylation at the HLA-B, ULBP2 and ULBB3 loci, but not at the other loci. MsLDR was found to represent a suitable and sensitive method for the detection of distinct methylation patterns as validated by conventional bisulphite Sanger sequencing and COBRA analysis. Since gene silencing by epigenetic mechanisms plays a central role during transformation of a normal differentiated somatic cell into a cancer cell, characterization of the gene methylation status in tumours is a major topic not only in basic research, but also in clinical diagnostics. Due to a very simple workflow, msLDR is likely to be applicable to clinical samples and thus comprises a potential diagnostic tool for clinical purposes.
