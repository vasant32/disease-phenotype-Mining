 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT) in colorectal carcinoma and analyze its correlations with the toxicities of chemotherapy. METHODS: The expression of OPRT mRNA was detected using RT-PCR in colorectal carcinoma tissues and paired adjacent normal tissues from 58 patients receiving FOLFOX6 regimen chemotherapy. The toxicities of the chemotherapy were recorded, and the correlations between OPRT mRNA expression and the toxicities were analyzed. RESULTS: OPRT mRNA expression was significantly higher in the tumor tissues than in the corresponding normal tissues (P=0.001), but OPRT expression in the tumor tissues was not correlated with the toxicities of the chemotherapy (P>0.05). OPRT level in the normal tissues showed a significant positive correlation with the occurrence of diarrhea in these cases (P=0.013). CONCLUSION: OPRT expression in colorectal carcinoma tissues is not correlated with the toxicities of 5-FU-based regimen, but OPRT expression in the normal tissues can help predict the toxicities associated with 5-FU.
