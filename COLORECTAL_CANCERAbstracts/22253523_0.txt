 AIM: To evaluate the correlation between the level of (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) uptake and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) expression in colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRA). METHODS: Forty four patients with resected CRA and preoperative (18)F-FDG positron emission tomography - computed tomography data were investigated in this study. Comparison of maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the lesion was made with GLUT1 expression by immunohistochemistry and various clinicopathologic factors including tumor volume, invasion depth, gross finding, and lymph node metastasis. RESULTS: SUVmax was 14.45 ± 7.0 in negative GLUT1 expression cases, 15.51 ± 5.7 in weak GLUT1 expression cases, and 16.52 ± 6.8 in strong GLUT1 expression cases, and there was no correlation between between GLUT1 expression and SUVmax. SUVmax was significantly correlated with tumor volume (P < 0.001). However, there was no significant differences in SUVmax and GLUT1 expression among other clinicopathologic factors. CONCLUSION: GLUT1 expression does not correlates significantly with (18)F-FDG uptake in CRA. (18)F-FDG uptake was increased with tumor volume, which is statistically significant.
