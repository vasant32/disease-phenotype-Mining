 CONTEXT: Scanty reports have focused on FDG-PET after radiofrequency ablation (RFA), for recurrence of hepatic metastases. Objective: To assess FDG-PET diagnostic accuracy on detection of recurrent hepatic lesions. METHODS: After a comprehensive search of PubMed and EMBASE, we performed a patient-based diagnostic meta-analysis of post-RFA FDG-PET. RESULTS: Across nine included articles, independent, random-effects sensitivity and specificity were 0.73(0.50-0.88) and 0.85(0.72-0.93), respectively. A symmetrical SROC curve was produced with no significant heterogeneity. Specificity was optimal for surgical RFA and colorectal origin of metastases. CONCLUSION: Synthesis of published evidence suggests PET/CT as an appropriate tool for optimizing post-ablation follow-up.
