The CEA related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAM) contain variable and constant immunoglobulin-like domains and are classified as a member of the immunoglobulin supergene family, IgSF. The seven CEACAM (CD66) antigens (CEACAM1, CEACAM3, CEACAM4, CEA, CEACAM6, CEACAM7 and CEACAM8) differ in the number of Ig-like domains, sugar content, presence of isoforms, tissue distribution and form of membrane attachment (transmembrane region or GPI anchor). CEACAMs with a transmembrane region possess a cytoplasmic domain with or without the immunoreceptor motifs. The structural diversity of CEACAMs results in their multifunctionality, especially displayed in calcium independent homo- and heterotypic adhesion interactions. The scientific data, collected mainly for CEA, strongly confirm involvement of this molecule in colorectal cancer. Recent research also indicates that CEACAMs play an important role in signal transduction, recognition and binding of pathogenic bacteria belonging to Neisseria and Escherichia genera.
