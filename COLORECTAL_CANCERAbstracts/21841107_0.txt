QUESTION: Some of my female patients are afraid of taking folic acid because they "fear cancer." What is the evidence for this? ANSWER: Theoretical evidence in experimental models is sharply contrasted by 3 recent meta-analyses of randomized and observational studies. Women planning to become pregnant should supplement with the folate dose they need to prevent neural tube defects.
