 BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy (CTx) before resection of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) may cause hepatic injury and postoperative complications. To ascertain whether adding bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against VEGF, to oxaliplatin-based CTx has an influence on liver injury and postoperative complications. METHODS: Patients with CRLM who received neoadjuvant CTx and underwent resection between 2003 and 2008 were analyzed whether or not they received bevacizumab added to oxaliplatin-based CTx. RESULTS: The total study group existed of 104 patients: 53 patients received oxaliplatin-based CTx and 51 patients received oxaliplatin-based CTx and bevacizumab. The overall complication rate (29%) was not significantly different between the two groups. The bevacizumab group exhibited less moderate sinusoidal dilatation (8% vs. 28%, P = 0.01). No difference in complication rate was found between patients given fewer than six cycles of oxaliplatin-based CTx and those given six or more cycles, or between patients with a short (<5 weeks) interval between the last dose of oxaliplatin and resection and those in which the interval was longer. CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab added to oxaliplatin-based CTx may protect against moderate sinusoidal dilatation without significantly influencing morbidity. Neither duration of oxaliplatin-based CTx nor the time interval between cessation of oxaliplatin-based CTx and surgery were associated with postoperative complications.
