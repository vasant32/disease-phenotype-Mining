Aim:  Colonoscopic follow-up after colorectal cancer resection (CRC) is recommended to screen for anastomotic recurrence and metachronous neoplasia, though guidelines vary in the timings of the first investigation. We aimed to quantify current practice and yield of neoplasia at first colonoscopy in relation to time from original resection. Method:  We conducted a retrospective case note study of all CRCs treated with curative intent within our hospital between two time periods: 2001 to 2003; and 2006 to 2007. Variables collected were: extent of preoperative luminal imaging, tumour site, procedure, timing and findings of initial colonoscopy, post operative CT findings and mortality. The first follow-up colonoscopy findings including neoplasia formation and recurrence rates were matched with rates of complete preoperative luminal imaging. Two year and five year outcomes were sought. Results:  863 patients underwent CRC with curative intent within these two time periods, (518vs 345). Colonoscopic follow up rates by two years were 32.8% vs 54.1%. Within the first cohort 63.5% of patients underwent colonoscopy by 5 years. Significant volumes of neoplasia and resectable recurrences were found before two years within these groups. Earlier detection of recurrent malignancy was associated with an improved patient outcome. Complete preoperative screening of the bowel was not associated with a lower incidence of neoplasia at first postoperative colonoscopy. Conclusion:  Our study demonstrates significant colonoscopic detection rates of neoplasia within two years of CRC. Patient outcomes were improved with earlier detection. We would therefore suggest an interval of no more than two years between resection and first surveillance colonoscopy. © 2012 The Authors Colorectal Disease © 2012 The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland.
