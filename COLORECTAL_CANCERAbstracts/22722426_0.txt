 OBJECTIVE: Plasma D-dimer levels are elevated in patients with a variety of solid tumors. Recently, it has been reported that the level before curative surgery is a prognostic factor for colorectal cancer (CRC). We investigated whether the plasma D-dimer level before systemic chemotherapies is a predictor for advanced or recurrent unresectable CRC. METHODS: This study included 42 patients treated with systemic chemotherapies for advanced or recurrent unresectable CRC. Variables including clinicopathological factors, plasma D-dimer levels and the modified Glasgow Prognostic Factor Score (mGPS) were evaluated. RESULTS: The plasma D-dimer level was closely related to the mGPS. Survival was shorter for patients with plasma D-dimer levels >5 Âµg/ml than for those with lower levels. Compared with an mGPS of 0 or 1, an mGPS of 2 was predictive of poor prognosis (p < 0.0001). Old age, advanced stage, plasma D-dimer level and mGPS were significantly associated with mortality, but plasma D-dimer level was the only independent risk factor in multivariate analysis, and was significant related to the clinical response to chemotherapy (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Survival was significantly shorter in patients with elevated plasma D-dimer levels having advanced or recurrent CRC. The plasma D-dimer level before systemic chemotherapies was an independent mortality predictor.
