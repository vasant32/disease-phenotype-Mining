Cetuximab is an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor used in metastatic colorectal cancer, and head and neck cancers. Several cutaneous side effects due to cetuximab such as acne-like rash, pruritus, dry skin, desquamation, hypertrichosis, and paronychia have been reported so far. A 59-year-old male patient with metastatic colon cancer referred to our outpatient clinic for his lesions on the dorsal surfaces of his hands and wrists, and on thighs developing after the chemotherapy. He was diagnosed as neutrophilic eccrine hydradenitis related to cetuximab in the light of clinical and histopathological findings. According to our knowledge, this is the first reported case of neutrophilic ecrine hydradenitis due to cetuximab.
