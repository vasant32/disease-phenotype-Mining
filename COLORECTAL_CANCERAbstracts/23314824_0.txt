PURPOSE: Minimal lymph node involvement is a potential prognostic factor in colorectal cancer. The International Union Against Cancer defined tumour deposits between 0.2 and 2 mm as micrometastases and clusters and single-cell infiltrations below this cutoff as isolated tumour cells. Nevertheless, only a minority of studies discriminated metastatic involvements according to this definition. METHODS: In order to investigate the prognostic significance of micrometastases (0.2-2 mm), we performed a retrospective study enrolling 44 routinely diagnosed micrometastatic cases within 15 years which represent about 1 % of our cases. These cases have been re-evaluated. RESULTS: Seven of the micrometastatic cases turned out to be macrometastases after step sectioning. Complete follow-up was available in 33 remaining cases. Collections of node-negative and macrometastatic cases served as control groups. The Kaplan-Meier curves of macro- and micrometastatic cases showed a similar adverse course (p = 0.830) especially during the first 40 months. The 5-year-survival rates were 51, 60 and 64 months for macro-, micrometastatic and node-negative cases, respectively. The difference in overall survival, however, reached only a statistical trend and was not significant (p = 0.137). After re-evaluation with step sections and cytokeratin immunohistochemistry out of an initial 91 node-negative cases, 11 (12 %) cases were identified with isolated tumour cells and one (1 %) case with a micrometastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that micro- and macrometastatic colorectal cancers show very similar survival rates. Therefore, efforts to improve the detection of lymph node micrometastases seem to be justified.
