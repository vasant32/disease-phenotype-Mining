INTRODUCTION: The authors report two cases of young patients who developed clubbing and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy in one case or lung diffusion disorder in the second, after a long-term use of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in a palliative setting of metastatic colorectal cancer. DISCUSSION: We propose that patients on long-term bevacizumab be examined for clubbing and undergo respiratory function tests and that this would be studied prospectively before beginning trials in evaluating this monoclonal antibody given for 2Â years in an adjuvant setting.
