 BACKGROUND AND AIM: The incidence of both diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia is increasing and they are risk factors for colorectal cancer (CRC). On the other hand, the carcinogenic significance of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs6983267 at 8q24, in CRC has been reported. The association between the SNP genotype and genes associated with diabetes or hyperlipidemia was investigated in cases of CRC. METHODS: In 107 cases of CRC diagnosed in eight institutes from 2003 to 2008, array-CGH and cDNA microarray was performed and the data analyzed from two groups subdivided according to SNP genotype. RESULTS: In the array-CGH data, we selected 38 genes related to diabetes or fat metabolism, and of these 10 had a correlation coefficient between the genome copy number at 8q24 locus and that of each gene. Of the 10 genes, insulin growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R) was the only one with an expression level significantly associated with the 8q24 genotype. IGF2R expression was significantly lower in non-risk allele than in risk allele cases (P = 0.012). There was neither a diabetes- nor a fat metabolism-related gene that was significantly associated with CRC cases with the risk allele at 8q24. CONCLUSIONS: SNP at 8q24 makes diabetes a risk factor of CRC via IGF2R, especially in genetically non-risk allele cases. We speculate that the risk allele of 8q24 might be risky enough that diabetes is not necessary to worsen the risk for CRC.
