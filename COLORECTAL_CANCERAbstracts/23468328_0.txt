BACKGROUND: The purpose of this multicentric prospective study was to evaluate postoperative HRQL and satisfaction with care after laparoscopic colonic resection for colorectal cancer in elderly patients. METHODS: A total of 116 patients were enrolled in this study: 33 patients older than age 70 years had laparoscopic colectomy, whereas 24 had open colectomy; 44 patients younger than age 70 years had laparoscopic colectomy and 15 of them had open colectomy. The patients answered to three questionnaires about generic (EORTC QLQ C30) and disease-specific quality of life (EORTC CR29) and about treatment satisfaction (EORTC IN-PATSAT32). Nonparametric tests and forward stepwise multiple regression analysis were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: One month after surgery, global quality of life (QL2 item) was significantly impaired in elderly patients who had laparoscopic colectomy compared with younger patients who had the same operation (p = 0.003). Similarly, role function (RF), physical function (PF), emotional function (EF), cognitive function (CF), and social function (SF) were impaired in elderly patients who had laparoscopic colectomy compared with younger patients (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.013, p < 0.001, p = 0.01, respectively). Fatigue (FA), sleep disturbances (SL), appetite loss (AP), and dyspnea (DY) affected the quality of life of these patients more than younger patients (p < 0.001, p = 0.055, p = 0.051, and p = 0.003, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy for cancer experience less postoperative local complications than elderly patients undergoing open colectomy. Nevertheless, in the first postoperative month, these patients experience a worse global quality of life than younger patients undergoing the same operation with impairment of all the functions and the presence of fatigue, sleep disturbances, appetite loss, and dyspnea.
