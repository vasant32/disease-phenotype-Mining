Aim. In this case report, the authors aim to demonstrate the success of recent methods in the radical treatment of a patient with primary inoperable liver and subsequent colorectal cancer pulmonary metastases. Methods. A 75 year old patient with inoperable bulky metastasis in the right hepatic lobe and insufficient future remnant liver volume was indicated for a stage procedure in the liver parenchyma. Embolization of the right branch of the portal vein was first performed with subsequent administration of stem cells into the contralateral liver lobe. Following compensatory growth of the left liver lobe, right-sided hepatectomy was performed with subsequent adjuvant oncological treatment. Six months after the surgery, a metastasis developed in the right pulmonary lobe which was solved by metastasectomy. Results. The patient, one year after the diagnosis of inoperable liver metastasis, is completely healthy and free of signs of disease recurrence. Conclusion. A comprehensive oncosurgical approach using up-to-date diagnostic and treatment options may offer patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, radical treatment with the hope of long-term quality survival.
