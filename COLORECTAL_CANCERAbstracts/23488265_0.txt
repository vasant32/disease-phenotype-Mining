In two statistically uniform groups of observation of oncocoloproctological patients a comparative analysis was made of healing median laparotomy wounds sutured traditionally (layerwise, hermetically) and with irrigating prolonged drainage of the subcutaneous fat. Traditional suturing of the wounds was followed by suppuration in 66%, while in laparotomy wounds where irrigating prolonged drainage was used there were no cases of suppuration.
