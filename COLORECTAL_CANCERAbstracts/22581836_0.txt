Reduced DNA repair capacity and DNA damage accumulation may lead to cancer development. Regulation of and coordination between genes involved in DNA repair pathways is fundamental for maintaining genome stability, and post-transcriptional gene regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs) may therefore be of particular relevance. In this context, the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the 3'untranslated regions of target DNA repair genes could alter the binding with specific miRNAs, modulating gene expression and ultimately affecting cancer susceptibility. In this study, we investigated the role of genetic variations in miRNA-binding sites of nucleotide excision repair (NER) genes in association with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. From 28 NER genes, we screened among SNPs residing in their 3'untranslated regions and simultaneously located in miRNA-binding sites, with an in silico approach. Through the calculation of different binding free energy according to both alleles of identified SNPs, and with global binding free energies median providing a threshold, we selected nine NER gene variants. We tested those SNPs in 1098 colorectal cancer cases and 1469 healthy controls from the Czech Republic. Rs7356 in RPA2 and rs4596 in GTF2H1 were associated with colorectal cancer risk. After stratification for tumor location, the association of both SNPs was significant only for rectal cancer (rs7356: OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.02-2.26, P = 0.04 and rs4596: OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50-0.94, P = 0.02; results not adjusted for multiple testing). Variation in miRNA target binding sites in the 3'untranslated region of NER genes may be important for modulating colorectal cancer risk, with a different relevance according to tumor location.
