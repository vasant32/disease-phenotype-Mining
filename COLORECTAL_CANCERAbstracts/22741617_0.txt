Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) are disorders that originate from immune disturbances. In our study, we evaluated the association between the -251 T/A interleukin (IL)-8 and the -1112 C/T IL-13 polymorphisms, the risk of IBD, and CRC development. Genotypes were determined by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 191 patients with CRC, 150 subjects with IBD, and 205 healthy controls. We found an association between CRC and the presence of the -251 TA genotype and A allele of the IL-8 gene (odds ratios [ORs] 2.28 and 1.65). A similar relationship was observed between these polymorphic variants and ulcerative colitis (OR 2.05 for the -251 TA genotype and OR 1.47 for the -251 A allele) as well as Crohn's disease (ORs 3.11 and 1.56, respectively). Our research also revealed that the CT and TT genotypes of the IL-13 -1112 C/T polymorphism may be connected with a higher risk of CRC (ORs 2.28 and 1.65). The same genotypes affected the susceptibility of IBD (ORs 2.26 and 3.72). Our data showed that the IL-8 -251 T/A and IL-13 -1112 C/T polymorphisms might be associated with the IBD and CRC occurrence and might be used as predictive factors of these diseases in a Polish population.
