 AIM: The aim of this study is to describe our 10-year experience in patients with urogynecological and colorectal carcinomas with radiation enteropathy treated surgically as an emergency, and to reassess symptoms and mortality. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 17 patients receiving emergency surgery for complications of radiotherapy. Data about the patients and outcomes of the treatment alternatives used were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Of 17 patients, nine had colorectal cancer, six had gynecological cancer, and two had cancer of the urinary system. As an emergency, 12 patients had ileus only, one patient had intestinal fistulae and ileus, two patients had bleeding and ileus and two patients had perforation on admission. Seven patients underwent resection and anastomosis, two patients intestinal by-pass, four patients resection and ostomy and four patients bridectomy. Morbidity (75% for early complications and 100% for late complications) and mortality in the early postoperative period (25%) were higher in the patients undergoing bridectomy than in the patients undergoing other surgical methods. The rate of early and late complications (71.4% and 66.6%, respectively) was lower in the patients undergoing resection-anastomosis with a higher of quality life. Only 11 patients survived during a long follow-up period (64.7%). CONCLUSION: As the postoperative complication rate, overall and operative mortality of patients treated for radiation enteropaties as emergent surgery are high, specialists following this group of patients may favor removal of the pathologic tissue to avoid complications in the early and late postoperative period.
