Colonoscopy is the best method for the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of colorectal cancer. Although it is generally considered a safe procedure, complications during colonoscopy may occur. The most serious complication is iatrogenic perforation of the colon. Although rare, it can be potentially lethal, especially when it is not recognized and treated immediately. The traditional management of iatrogenic colonic perforation is surgical repair, either by laparotomy or laparoscopy. However, with the recent improvement of endoscopic devices and techniques, endoscopic repair of iatrogenic colonic perforation using endoclips is considered to be both feasible and effective. We successfully used endoscopic clipping to treat a patient with a large perforation of the colon during diagnostic colonoscopy. We believe that the endoscopic repair avoids unnecessary surgery and reduces medical costs.
