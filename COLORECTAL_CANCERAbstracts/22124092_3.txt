 PURPOSE: To examine the association between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and survival among patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and to evaluate whether this association varies by sex, insulin treatment, and durations of T2DM and insulin use. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was conducted among 2,278 men and women diagnosed with nonmetastatic colon or rectal cancer between 1992 and 2007 in the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition Cohort, a prospective study of cancer incidence. In 1992 to 1993, participants completed a detailed, self-administrated questionnaire. Vital status and cause of death were ascertained through the end of 2008. Multivariable-adjusted relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Among the 2,278 men and women with nonmetastatic CRC, there were 842 deaths by the end of follow-up (including 377 deaths from CRC and 152 deaths from cardiovascular disease [CVD]). Among men and women combined, compared with patients without T2DM, patients with CRC and T2DM were at higher risk of all-cause mortality (RR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.28 to 1.83), CRC-specific mortality (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.70), and CVD-specific mortality (RR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.44 to 3.24), with no apparent differences by sex or durations of T2DM or insulin use. Insulin use, compared with no T2DM, was associated with increased risk of death from all causes (RR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.22 to 2.31) and CVD (RR, 3.87; 95% CI, 2.12 to 7.08) but not from CRC (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.28 to 1.19). CONCLUSION: Patients with CRC and T2DM have a higher risk of mortality than patients with CRC who do not have T2DM, especially a higher risk of death from CVD.
