Mitochondrial transcription factorÂ A (mtTFA) is necessary for both the transcription             and maintenance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The present study investigated the             relationship between clinicopathological factors, prognosis and the immunohistochemical             expression of mtTFA in the tumors of patients diagnosed with primary colorectal             cancer (CRC). Surgical specimens from 105 colorectal patients were immunohistochemically             stained using a polyclonal anti-mtTFA antibody. The relationships among the mtTFA             expression, clinicopathological factors and prognosis were evaluated. A total             of 47 (44.8%) of the 105 patients with CRC were determined to have positive mtTFA             expression. The positive expression of mtTFA significantly correlated with lymph             node metastasis, distant metastasis and advanced TNM staging. On the other hand,             negative mtTFA expression showed a tendency to correlate with high Ki-67 index.             The survival of patients with positive mtTFA expression was significantly worse             than that of patients with negative mtTFA expression. The positive mtTFA expression             appears to be a useful marker for tumor progression and poor prognosis in patients             with CRC.
