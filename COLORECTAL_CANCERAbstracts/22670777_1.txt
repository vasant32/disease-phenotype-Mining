The pattern-recognition molecules mannan-binding lectin (MBL) and the three ficolins circulate in blood in complexes with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs). When MBL or ficolin recognizes a microorganism, activation of the MASPs occurs leading to activation of the complement system, an important component of the innate immune system. Three proteins are produced from the MASP1 gene: MASP-1 and MASP-3 and MAp44. We present an assay specific for MASP-1, which is based on inhibition of the binding of anti-MASP-1-specific antibody to MASP-1 domains coated onto microtitre wells. MASP-1 was found in serum in large complexes eluting in a position corresponding to ∼600 kDa after gel permeation chromatography in calcium-containing buffer and as monomers of ∼75 kDa in dissociating buffer. The concentration of MASP-1 in donor sera (n = 105) was distributed log-normally with a median value of 11 µg/ml (range 4-30 µg/ml). Serum and citrate plasma levels were similar, while the values in ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid plasma were slightly lower and in heparin plasma were 1·5 times higher than in serum. MASP-1 was present at adult level at 1 year of age, while it was 60% at birth. In normal healthy individuals the level of MASP-1 was stable throughout a 2-month period. After induction of an acute-phase reaction by operation we found an initial short decrease, concomitant with an increase in C-reactive protein levels, followed by an increase, doubling the MASP-1 concentration after 2 days. The present data prepare the ground for studies on the associations of MASP-1 levels with disease.
