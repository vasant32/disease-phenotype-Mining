We are conducting an open-label multicentre phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of XELOX and bevacizumab in late-stage elderly patients with unresectable advanced/recurrent colorectal cancer. The primary endpoint of the study is progression-free survival. The secondary endpoints are the toxicity, overall response rate, time to treatment failure and overall survival. Thirty-five patients are required for the study.
