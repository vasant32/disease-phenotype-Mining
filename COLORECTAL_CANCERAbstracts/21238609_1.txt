Consensus guidelines of the American Cancer Society, the US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, and the American College of Radiology recommend first-degree relatives of individuals diagnosed with an adenoma before age 60 should be screened every 5 years with colonoscopy starting at age 40. This is the identical recommendation for those with a first-degree relative diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) before age 60. There is good evidence that first-degree relatives of individuals diagnosed with CRC before age 60 are at substantially increased risk for developing cancer at a young age. However, it is unclear whether an individual with a first-degree relative with an adenoma diagnosed before age 60 is at increased risk of CRC. Because not all adenomas portend the same cancer risk in the individual who has the adenoma, they would not be expected to portend the same risk in their first-degree relatives. Because of these uncertainties, the US Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend more aggressive screening of first-degree relatives of individuals with an adenoma. The adenoma detection rate for individuals 50 to 59 years old without a first-degree relative with CRC is sufficiently high (approximately 25%-30%) that almost half the population would be high risk on the basis of one first-degree relative having an adenoma. Given the weakness of evidence supporting the guidelines, suboptimal levels of screening in the general population, and lack of resources to comply with the recommendation, first-degree relatives of individuals with adenomas should be screened as average-risk persons until more compelling data are available to justify more aggressive screening.
