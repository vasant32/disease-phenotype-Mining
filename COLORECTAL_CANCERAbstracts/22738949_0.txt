 INTRODUCTION: Optimal follow-up after colorectal resection for adenocarcinoma is yet to be determined. The aim of this study was to examine the role of a fifth-year surveillance Computed Tomography (CT) scan in detecting recurrence in our population. METHOD: A retrospective analysis of all patients who had undergone potentially curative resections of colorectal adenocarcinomas between 2003 and 2004 was performed using electronic and casenote records. Data analysis was performed using Microsoft Office Excel 2007 and GnuPSPP statistical software. RESULTS: Two hundred and seven patients (111 male and 96 female) with a median age of 74 years (IQR 66-80) undergoing colorectal resections were studied. One hundred and twenty-one patients (58%) were alive and disease free at 5 years of whom 81 (67%) had received a fifth-year surveillance CT scan. Fifth-year scanning did not demonstrate any new colorectal metastases. However 6 (7%) scans revealed new, undiagnosed, non-colorectal malignancies. Thirty-four patients developed metastatic disease. All metastasis were diagnosed by 3Â½ years of follow-up. Eleven of these 34 cases presented after their second-year surveillance CT scan. Those patients with asymptomatic metastasis at the time of their discovery demonstrated improved likelihood of five year survival. CONCLUSION: This study showed no role for a fifth-year surveillance CT scan in the detection of resectable metastases, however there was a 7% pick up rate for detecting new malignancies. CT scanning beyond 2 years was needed to identify about one-third of the recurrences reported in this study.
