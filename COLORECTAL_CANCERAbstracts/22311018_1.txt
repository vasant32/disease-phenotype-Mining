The recent studies indicated that the epithelial cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin is a well-recognized molecule that is important in cell adhesion. To further investigate the molecular basis of this notion, we used small-interfering RNA to inhibit E-cadherin function and found that loss of E-cadherin promoted Colorectal cancer cell growth, invasion and drug resistance through induction of Î²-catenin nuclear translocation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Further analysis of E-cadherin expression with clinicopathologic parameters showed that E-cadherin expression decreased in Colorectal cancer patients who developed liver metastasis (P = 0.043). These findings indicate that E-cadherin loss in tumors contributes to progression and metastatic dissemination. Thus, E-cadherin can act as a central modulator of the cell biological phenotypes and a potential prognostic marker in Colorectal cancer.
