 PURPOSE: Oxidative damage has been implicated in carcinogenesis. We hypothesized that elevated systemic oxidative status would be associated with later occurrence of colorectal adenomatous polyps, a precursor of colorectal cancer. METHODS: We examined the prospective association between four systemic markers of oxidative status and colorectal adenomatous polyps within a nondiabetic subcohort of the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (n = 425). Urine samples were collected from 1992 to 1994 and colorectal adenomas prevalence were assessed in 2002 to 2004. Oxidative status markers were assessed, which included four F(2)-isoprostanes (F(2)-IsoPs) from the classes III and IV: iPF2α-III, 2,3-dinor-iPF2α-III (a metabolite of iPF2α-III), iPF2α-VI, and 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI. All biomarkers were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Prospective associations were assessed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) for occurrence of colorectal adenomatous polyps and scaled to 1 SD of F(2)-IsoP distribution were 1.16 (95% CI, 0.88-1.50), 0.88 (95% CI, 0.63-1.17), 1.04 (95% CI, 0.80-1.34), and 1.16 (95% CI, 0.90-1.48) for iPF2α-III, iPF2α-VI, 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI, and 2,3-dinor-iPF2α-III, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of association between F(2)-IsoPs and adenomatous polyps does not support the hypothesis that elevated oxidative status is associated with colorectal adenomatous polyp occurrence during a 10-year period of follow-up.
