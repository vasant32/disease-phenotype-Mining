Each year colorectal cancer is diagnosed in more women than all types of gynecologic cancer combined. There continues to be a significant need to increase the rate of screening. Obstetricianâ€“gynecologists have a unique opportunity to increase colorectal cancer screening rates among their patients and, thus, favorably affect colorectal cancer morbidity and mortality. Health care providers should counsel patients about the benefits of colorectal cancer screening and recommend colonoscopy every 10 years for either average-risk or high-risk women 50 years and older. The advantages and limitations of other appropriate colorectal cancer screening methods also should be discussed so that women may choose to be tested by whichever method they are most likely to accept and complete.
