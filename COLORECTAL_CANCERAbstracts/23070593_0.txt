In some biomedical studies, biomarkers are measured repeatedly along some spatial structure or over time and are subject to measurement error. In these studies, it is often of interest to evaluate associations between a clinical endpoint and these biomarkers (also known as functional biomarkers). There are potentially two levels of correlation in such data, namely, between repeated measurements of a biomarker from the same subject and between multiple biomarkers from the same subject; none of the existing methods accounts for correlation between multiple functional biomarkers. We propose a Bayesian approach to model a clinical outcome of interest (e.g. risk for colorectal cancer) in the presence of multiple functional biomarkers while accounting for potential correlation. Our simulations show that the proposed approach achieves good performance in finite samples under various settings. In the presence of substantial or moderate correlation, the proposed approach outperforms an existing approach that does not account for correlation. The proposed approach is applied to a study of biomarkers of risk for colorectal neoplasms and our results show that the risk for colorectal cancer is associated with two functional biomarkers, APC and TGF-Î±, in particular, with their values in the region between the proliferating and differentiating zones of colorectal crypts.
