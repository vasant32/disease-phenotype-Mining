Aquaporins (AQPs) are a membrane protein family involved in the selective             transport of water across cell membranes. Recent studies have reported the expression             of AQP5 in several tumor types such as gastric, pulmonary, ovarian, pancreatic             and colorectal cancer. We have previously reported the expression on tumor cells             and the important role of AQP3 on cell growth in tongue cancer. However, little             is known about the expression and precise role of AQP5 on squamous cell carcinoma             (SCC) of the tongue. We investigated the expression of AQP5 and AQP3 in human             oral SCC and adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). Overexpression of both AQP5 and AQP3             were immunohistochemically observed on tumor cells in SCC, whereas ACC cells were             faintly stained with those antibodies against AQPs. Treatment with pan-AQP inhibitor             or specific AQP5-siRNA showed inhibition of cell growth in SCC cell lines via             the inhibition of integrins and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.             AQPs play important roles in cell growth in SCC rather than ACC.
