 AIM: To assess the gender preferences, specifically the gender of the nursing staff (endoscopy assistants) and the impact on acceptance for screening colonoscopy (SC). METHODS: Patients or relatives attending the clinics or health care workers working in a tertiary center were invited to participate in this questionnaire study. The questionnaire enquired on the general demographics (1) age, gender, ethnicity, education level, and employment status, previous history of colonoscopy, family or personal history of colonic pathologies, personal and family history of any cancers; (2) subjects were asked if they would go for an SC if they had appropriate indications (age over 50 years, family history of colorectal cancer (CRC), fecal occult blood positive, anemia especially iron deficiency anemia, bleeding per rectum with or without loss of appetite, weight loss and abdominal pain) with and without symptoms attributable to CRC; and (3) preferences for the gender of the endoscopists and assistants and whether they would still undergo SC even if their preferences were not met. RESULTS: Eighty-four point seven percent (470/550) completed questionnaire were analysed. More female subjects expressed gender preferences for the endoscopists [overall 70%; female (67.7%) and male (2.3%)] compared to male subjects [overall 62.8%; male (56%) and female (6.8%), P = 0.102]. Similarly, more female subjects expressed gender preferences for the assistants [overall 74.5%; female (73.4%) and male (1.1%)] compared to male subjects [overall 58%, male (49.3%) and female (8.7%), P < 0.001]. Overall, a third would decline an SC, despite having appropriate indications, if their preferences were not met. On univariate analysis, male gender, non-Malay ethnicity (Chinese and others) and previous colonoscopy experience were more likely to undergo an SC, even if their preferences were not met (all P < 0.05). Gender and previous experience [odds ratio (OR) 1.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-2.82, P < 0.05] with colonoscopy (OR 4.70, 95% CI 1.41-15.66, P < 0.05) remained significant on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Genders preference for the endoscopy nurses/assistants is more common than for the endoscopist among women and has implications for the success of a screening colonoscopy program.
