A new cubitane diterpenoid, crassalone A (1), was isolated from the marine soft coral Sinularia crassa. The structure was determined by extensive spectroscopic analyses. Compound 1 is not cytotoxic (IC₅₀ > 20 μg/mL) toward the four human cancer cell lines tested (HL60, MDA-MB-231, HCT-116 and DLD-1).
