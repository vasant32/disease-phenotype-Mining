A 52-year-old woman with multiple liver metastasis of cecal cancer underwent laparoscopic right hemi-colectomy in September 2010. One year of postoperative chemotherapy for liver metastasis achieved good control, but both ovaries enlarged because of metastasis and caused abdominal distension. In order to improve quality of life, we performed ovarian tumor resection in December 2011. After surgery, she was free from abdominal symptoms and continued to receive chemotherapy. We believe that surgical resection is indicated for ovarian metastasis of colorectal cancer with severe abdominal symptoms, even when metastases are present in other organs.
