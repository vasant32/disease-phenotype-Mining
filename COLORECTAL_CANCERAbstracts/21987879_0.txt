Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a public health problem. It is one of the most common cancers and mortality rate is around 50%. This article reports on the various methods of primary prevention testing for the population at average risk of developing CRC. Given its slow evolution through pre-cancerous lesions, it is appropiate to identify patients at medium risk and monitore those at high risk. Current screening methods show very different efficiencies. The most efficient are invasive and limit public support. New non-invasive tests based on fecal and blood biomarkers are being developed and will probably help to improve CRC screening in the future in an attempt to lower mortality rate.
