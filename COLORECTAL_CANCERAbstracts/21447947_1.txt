 BACKGROUND: The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of irinotecan-cetuximab-bevacizumab in combination as a salvage treatment for heavily pretreated metastatic colorectal cancer patients. METHODS: A total of 39 patients resistant to both oxaliplatin and irinotecan were included in this retrospective study. Treatment consisted of irinotecan 180/m(2) every 14 days, weekly cetuximab standard dose and bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every 14 days. RESULTS: Partial response was observed in 8 patients (20%), stable disease in 24 (61%) and progressive disease in 7 (18%). Overall response rate in KRAS wild type was 6/22 (27%) and in mutated KRAS it was 2/15 (13%). Median time to progression was 8 months (6.4-9.4) and median overall survival 12 months (10.1-13.8). Overall, grade 3-4 adverse events were observed in 24 patients (62%). CONCLUSIONS: This regimen is active and moderately well tolerated in heavily pretreated advanced colorectal patients. However, caution is advisable when interpreting these results, because they run against the findings of two large phase III trials.
