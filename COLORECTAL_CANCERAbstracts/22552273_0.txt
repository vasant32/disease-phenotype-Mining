Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic progressive disorder which involves the medium size and large ducts in the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree. The great majority of cases have underlying inflammatory bowel disease, mainly ulcerative colitis. A higher risk of colorectal cancer has been described among ulcerative colitis patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Here we report a case of a primary sclerosing cholangitis in a young male with a newly diagnosed ulcerative colitis presenting with colonic dysplasia. Surveillance for colorectal cancer should be strongly recommended in this group of patients.
