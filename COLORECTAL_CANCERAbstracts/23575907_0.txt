BACKGROUND: Isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) with melphalan is an established approach for patients with unresectable metastatic liver lesions. This study determined the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 5-FU with oxaliplatin via IHP. METHODS: Standard 3 × 3 Phase I design. Subjects with unresectable isolated CRC liver metastases scheduled for HAI pump were eligible. IHP used fixed-dose oxaliplatin with escalating 5-FU doses. Toxicity (CTCAE v 4.0) and response (RECIST), progression-free survival, and overall survival (OS) were assessed. Systemic and IHP plasma PK of 5-FU, anabolites, and platinum were determined. RESULTS: All 12 patients had received ≥1 line of pre-IHP chemotherapy. There were 4 grade 3 serious adverse events (33.3 %) and 1 grade 4 event (8.3 %). Also, 2 dose-limiting toxicities occurred at DL2 at 300 mg/m(2), resulting in expansion of DL1 at 200 mg/m(2) 5-FU, the eventual MTD. At 6-month follow-up, 9 patients (82 %) demonstrated partial response, while 2 (18 %) exhibited stable disease. Also, 64 % of patients demonstrated a >50 % decrease in CEA. The 1- and 2-year OS probabilities were 90.9 and 71.6 %, respectively, with median follow-up of 24 months. IHP exposures (AUC0-60 min) were 10.9 ± 4.5 μgPt h/mL, 49.3 ± 30.7 μg h/mL 5-FU (DL1), and 70.5 ± 35.5 μg h/mL 5-FU (DL2). Systemic exposure (AUC0-inf) relative to IHP exposure was negligible for both platinum (1.1 ± 1.5 %) and 5-FU (0.09 ± 0.10 %). CONCLUSIONS: The MTD for IHP was 200 mg/m(2) 5-FU with 40 mg/m(2) oxaliplatin. Systemic exposure to the agents was minimal during IHP. The response and survival observed warrants assessment in a larger phase II trial.
