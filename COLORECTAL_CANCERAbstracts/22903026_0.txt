 BACKGROUND: Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), a highly sensitive technique for resolving thermally-induced protein folding/unfolding transitions, recently was recognized as a novel tool for disease diagnosis and monitoring. To further elaborate this approach we have applied DSC in a study of blood plasma from patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) at different stages of tumor development and localization. METHODS: Blood plasma from patients diagnosed with CRC was analyzed by DSC. The CRC thermograms were compared to those of healthy individuals and patients with gastric cancer and non-cancerous soft tissue inflammation. The thermodynamic parameters: excess heat capacity and enthalpy of the transitions corresponding to the most abundant plasma proteins, as well as transition and first moment temperatures were determined from the calorimetric profiles. RESULTS: The calorimetric profiles of blood plasma from CRC patients are found to be distinct from those of healthy individuals and those of patients with soft tissue, non-cancerous inflammation. Generally the CRC thermograms exhibit reduced heat capacity of the major albumin/globulin-assigned thermal transitions, lower enthalpy and a featureless high temperature region compared to healthy individuals. CONCLUSIONS: A classification of blood plasma proteome from patients with colorectal cancer (CRC1, CRC2 and CRC3 groups, and subgroups within each group CRC1(1-2), CRC2(1-2) and CRC3(1-2)) is proposed based on the derived thermodynamic parameters. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The presented data demonstrate a proof of principle and confirm that the DSC technique has a potential to monitor changes in the CRC blood plasma proteome. This study is a further step toward the validation of calorimetry as a diagnostic tool.
