Wnt/β-catenin signalling regulates cell proliferation by modulating the cell cycle and is negatively regulated by conductin/axin2/axil. We show that conductin levels peak at G2/M followed by a rapid decline during return to G1. In line with this, Wnt/β-catenin target genes are low at G2/M and high at G1/S, and β-catenin phosphorylation oscillates during the cell cycle in a conductin-dependent manner. Conductin is degraded by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome cofactor CDC20. Knockdown of CDC20 blocks Wnt signalling through conductin. CDC20-resistant conductin inhibits Wnt signalling and attenuates colony formation of colorectal cancer cells. We propose that CDC20-mediated degradation of conductin regulates Wnt/β-catenin signalling for maximal activity during G1/S.
