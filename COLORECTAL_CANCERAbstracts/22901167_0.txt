 BACKGROUND: Analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions for complex multifactorial human disease faces challenges regarding statistical methodology. One major difficulty is partly due to the limitations of parametric-statistical methods for detection of gene effects that are dependent solely or partially on interactions with other genes or environmental exposures. Based on our previous case-control study in Chongqing of China, we have found increased risk of colorectal cancer exists in individuals carrying a novel homozygous TT at locus rs1329149 and known homozygous AA at locus rs671. METHODS: In this study, we proposed statistical method- crossover analysis in combination with logistic regression model, to further analyze our data and focus on assessing gene-environmental interactions for colorectal cancer. RESULTS: The results of the crossover analysis showed that there are possible multiplicative interactions between loci rs671 and rs1329149 with alcohol consumption. Multi- factorial logistic regression analysis also validated that loci rs671 and rs1329149 both exhibited a multiplicative interaction with alcohol consumption. Moreover, we also found additive interactions between any pair of two factors (among the four risk factors: gene loci rs671, rs1329149, age and alcohol consumption) through the crossover analysis, which was not evident on logistic regression. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the method based on crossover analysis-logistic regression is successful in assessing additive and multiplicative gene-environment interactions, and in revealing synergistic effects of gene loci rs671 and rs1329149 with alcohol consumption in the pathogenesis and development of colorectal cancer.
