 BACKGROUND: Laboratory studies suggest a possible role of magnesium intake in colorectal carcinogenesis but epidemiological evidence is inconclusive. METHOD: We tested magnesium-colorectal cancer hypothesis in the Nurses' Health Study, in which 85â€‰924 women free of cancer in 1980 were followed until June 2008. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate multivariable relative risks (MV RRs, 95% confidence intervals). RESULTS: In the age-adjusted model, magnesium intake was significantly inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk; the RRs from lowest to highest decile of total magnesium intake were 1.0 (ref), 0.93, 0.81, 0.72, 0.74, 0.77, 0.72, 0.75, 0.80, and 0.67 (P(trend)<0.001). However, in the MV model adjusted for known dietary and non-dietary risk factors for colorectal cancer, the association was significantly attenuated; the MV RRs were 1.0 (ref), 0.96, 0.85, 0.78, 0.82, 0.86, 0.84, 0.91, 1.02, and 0.93 (P(trend)=0.77). Similarly, magnesium intakes were significantly inversely associated with concentrations of plasma C-peptide in age-adjusted model (P(trend)=0.002) but not in multivariate-adjusted model (P(trend)=0.61). Results did not differ by subsite or modified by calcium intakes or body mass index. CONCLUSION: These prospective results do not support an independent association of magnesium intake with either colorectal cancer risk or plasma C-peptide levels in women.
