This chapter refers to the application of laser-capture microdissection with oligonucleotide microarray analysis. The protocol described has been successfully used to identify differential transcript expression between contrasting colorectal cancer invasive phenotypes. Tissue processing, RNA extraction, quality control, amplification, fluorescent labelling, purification, hybridisation, and elements of data analysis are covered.
