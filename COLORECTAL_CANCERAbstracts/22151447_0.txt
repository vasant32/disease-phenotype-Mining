 INTRODUCTION: Surgical resection remains the only potentially curative treatment for colorectal liver metastases (CLM). However, involvement of both the hepatic lobes or extrahepatic disease (EHD) can be a contra-indication for resection. The aim of the present study was to examine the addition of combined positron emission and computed tomography (PET/CT) to CLM staging to assess the effects upon staging and management. METHODS: All CLM patients referred to a single centre between January 2005 and January 2009 were prospectively included. All underwent routine staging (clinical examination and computed tomography), followed by a whole body (18) fluoro-deoxy-glucose ((18)FDG)-PET/CT scan and Fong clinical risk score calculation. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients were included [63% male with a median age of 63 years (age range 32-79 years)]. The addition of PET/CT led to disease upstaging in 20 patients (31%) and downstaging in two patients (3%). EHD was found in 24% of low-risk patients (Fong score 0-2) as compared with 44% of high-risk patients (Fong score 3-5) (P= 0.133). There was a trend towards a greater influence upon management in patients with a low score (44% vs. 17%; P= 0.080). CONCLUSION: The addition of PET/CT led to management changes in over one-third of patients but there was no correlation between alterations in staging or management and the Fong clinical risk score; suggesting that PET/CT should be utilized, where available, in the pre-operative staging of CLM patients.
