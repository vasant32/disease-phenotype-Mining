 BACKGROUND: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is an outstanding endoscopic technique in which a colonic lesion can be resected en-bloc. However, the procedure requires a high level of skill and the procedure has yet to be standardized. At the present time, colorectal ESD is only permitted in Japanese institutions that have been certified for advanced medical treatments. METHODS: We examined 200 cases of colorectal ESD that were performed in our hospital. RESULTS: Over time, it was found that there was a continuous improvement in the treatment outcomes along with advances in both the procedures and the peripheral equipment utilized. CONCLUSION: Current results suggest that the colorectal ESD procedure is relatively stable. To ensure colorectal ESD continues to be safe, indications for its use need to be more fully investigated and medical personnel must be trained to carefully perform the procedure.
