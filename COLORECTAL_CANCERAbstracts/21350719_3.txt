 AIM: To compare the fast-track rehabilitation program and conventional care for patients after resection of colorectal cancer. METHODS: One hundred and six consecutive patients who underwent fast-track rehabilitation program were encouraged to have early oral feeding and movement for early discharge, while 104 consecutive patients underwent conventional care after resection of colorectal cancer. Their gastrointestinal functions, postoperative complications and hospital stay time were recorded. RESULTS: The restoration time of gastrointestinal functions in the patients was significantly faster after fast-track rehabilitation program than after conventional care (2.1 d vs 3.2 d, P<0.01). The percentage of patients who developed complications was significantly lower 30 d after fast-track rehabilitation program than after conventional care (13.2% vs 26.9%, P<0.05). Also, the percentage of patients who had general complications was significantly lower 30 d after fast-track rehabilitation program than after conventional care (6.6% vs 15.4%, P<0.05). The postoperative hospital stay time of the patients was shorter after fast-track rehabilitation program than after conventional care (5 d vs 7 d, P<0.01). No significant difference was observed in the re-admission rate 30 d after fast-track rehabilitation program and conventional care (3.8% vs 8.7%). CONCLUSION: The fast-track rehabilitation program can significantly decrease the complications and shorten the time of postoperative hospital stay of patients after resection colorectal cancer.
