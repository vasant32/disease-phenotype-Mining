 AIMS: To assess the significance and the impact of focal FDG uptake in the colon in oncology patients without known colorectal carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was undertaken on 2,220 (18)F-FDG PET/CT studies carried out consecutively in the Nuclear Medicine Department in our hospital from 2 December 2008 to 31 May 2010. Inclusion criteria were patients with abnormal (18)F-FDG uptake in colorectal area that could not be explained (or not previously known) by their clinical histories. Patients previously diagnosed with colorectal carcinoma were excluded. A total of 86 patients (57 male, average age 63.4, range 46-85) were finally included. Colonoscopy with biopsy was established as a reference test. The impact of these findings on the diagnostic-therapeutic management in these patients was evaluated. RESULTS: A colonoscopy was performed in 54 of the 86 patients, this examination not having been done up-to-date in the remaining 32 patients. Biopsy was obtained in 43 lesions of the 54 patient in whom a colonoscopy was performed. Colon disease was detected in 49 of these 54 patients, obtaining 54 FDG incidental foci which corresponded to 10 previously unsuspected primary colorectal carcinoma, 3 metastases, 27 adenomatous polyps with different degrees of dysplasia and 14 inflammatory processes. In the remaining 5 patients, the colonoscopy was normal. PET/CT modified the diagnostic and treatment management in most of the patients (49/54, that is 91%). CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the need to determine the cause of abnormal (18)F-FDG colorectal uptakes in the PET/CT studies by using colonoscopy and biopsy. This approach allows for the detection and early treatment of malignant and premalignant lesions.
