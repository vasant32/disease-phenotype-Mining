 PURPOSE: To measure the prevalence of nausea and vomiting 2 to 5 days after oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-four patients (55% men; 44% women) enrolled onto this cross-sectional study. Fifty-three (83%) had colon cancer and received oxaliplatin biweekly. Eleven (17%) had rectal cancer and received oxaliplatin weekly. We collected data on 23 patients for the first cycle and on 41 patients for the first two cycles, for a total of 105 cycles. Nausea and vomiting was graded using Common Toxicity Criteria. Patients maintained a 7-day postinfusion diary of nausea and vomiting and antiemetic use. RESULTS: All patients received antiemetics and steroids on day 1 of each cycle. For patients with data collected for both cycles, the occurrence of nausea was the same during cycles one and two. Thirty-nine percent used rescue antiemetics in cycle one, and 34% did so in cycle two. Sixty-eight percent of men reported no nausea in cycle one compared with 33% of women; for cycle two, these figures were 67% and 36%, respectively. Eighty-nine percent of patients reported no vomiting in cycle one, and 85% did so in cycle two. Seven patients (11%) had a history of motion sickness; 13 of 28 women (46%) reported history of pregnancy-induced morning sickness. Palonosetron slightly but significantly reduced the occurrence of nausea. Female sex and history of chemotherapy were significant risk factors for nausea. CONCLUSION: Delayed nausea associated with oxaliplatin was well controlled and evenly divided between grades 1 and 2; vomiting was rare. Factors associated with nausea were intrinsic to the patient and mostly unrelated to the antiemetics used. Sex and previous experience with emesis should be considered for efficient antiemetic management.
