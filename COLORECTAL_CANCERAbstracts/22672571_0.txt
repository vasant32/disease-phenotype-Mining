 AIM: The national Bowel Cancer Screening Programme has been rolled out nationwide following pilot screening in two health authorities in the UK. The aim of this study was to define overall 5-year survival of screen detected cancers and to compare the overall survival outcome of screened vs symptomatic patients over a 10-year period. METHOD: All patients with colorectal cancer treated at one trust in patients of screening age (50-69 years) during the pilot screening programme (2000-2008) were analysed. Patients were defined as screen detected or symptomatically detected. Disease pathology and recurrence data were obtained from the hospital's computerized results reporting system and mortality was cross-matched with data from the West Midlands Cancer Intelligence Network. RESULTS: In all, 633 patients aged 50-69 were identified in the study period; 155 patients had a screen detected cancer and 478 did not. A log-rank test completed on survival outcomes indicated that survival was significantly worse in the symptomatic group. This difference persisted if only patients treated with curative intent were considered. CONCLUSION: Survival outcome was significantly better in the screened vs the symptomatic population in all groups and also in those treated for curative intent. There was a trend towards better survival for screen detected cancer when compared stage for stage.
