 AIM: The aim of the present study was to evaluate single center experience with hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin in patients with liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma (CRC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 68 patients treated between 1998 and 2007 was performed. RESULTS: Among 60 patients who had no simultaneous liver-directed procedure (LDP), the best results obtained were complete response in two patients (3%), partial response in 18 patients (30%), and stable disease in 23 patients (38%), for an overall disease control rate of 72%. Median progression-free survival was 11 months, and median survival was 24 months. Overall survival was significantly better in patients with simultaneous LDP or secondary resection. Steatosis was present in all secondary resection specimens. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate the efficacy of HAI of irinotecan combined with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin for liver metastases from CRC, specifically in patients also treated with LDP.
