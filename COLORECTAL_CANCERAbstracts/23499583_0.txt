OBJECTIVES: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the three most common cancers in both genders. Even though several biomarkers are in use in diagnosis and prognosis of the disease, they are marred by limited specificity and sensitivity. The human kallikrein-related peptidase 10 (KLK10) gene is a member of the human tissue kallikrein family. Because prostate specific antigen (PSA), the best biomarker for detecting and monitoring prostate cancer, is a member of this family, many other members, including KLK10, have been widely examined as novel biomarkers for different cancer types. In previous studies, KLK10 has been proposed as a diagnostic biomarker for ovarian carcinoma, while its methylation on exon 3 has been proposed as a prognostic marker for early-stage breast cancer patients. The purpose of this study was to analyse KLK10 mRNA expression and examine its prognostic value and potential clinical application as a novel molecular tissue biomarker in CRC. DESIGN AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 190 colorectal samples. Total RNA was extracted from pulverised tissues and cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription. KLK10 was amplified by real-time PCR. B2M was used as a reference gene and HT-29 cells as positive control. RESULTS: KLK10 expression was significantly higher in cancer tissues (P<0.001). Tumours of advanced TNM and Duke's stage showed high KLK10 expression status (P=0.036; P=0.025). Patients with high KLK10 expression had a shorter disease-free and overall survival rates (P=0.014; P=0.020). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that KLK10 may serve as a new marker of unfavourable prognosis of colorectal cancer.
