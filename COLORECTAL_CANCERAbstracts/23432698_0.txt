Therapies that target angiogenesis and the VEGF pathway are a component of treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to VEGFA. Chemotherapy plus bevacizumab has led to improved outcomes for mCRC patients. Despite these benefits, progressive disease invariably ensues. Multiple members of the VEGF family can potentially contribute to tumor angiogenesis and/or evasion of antiangiogenic therapy if one pathway should be inhibited. Aflibercept, a new biological agent, is a multiple angiogenic factor trap that prevents not only VEGFA, but also VEGFB and PlGF from activating their native receptors. Key clinical data for bevacizumab and aflibercept for treatment of mCRC, clinical evidence for use of these agents beyond progression, and the search for angiogenic biomarkers to better define patients most likely to benefit from these interventions will be reviewed.
