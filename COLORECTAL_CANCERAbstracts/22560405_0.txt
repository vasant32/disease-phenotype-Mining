 OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: We investigated the usefulness of a clinical risk scoring system (CRS) for guiding management and defining prognosis for patients with colorectal liver met"astases (CLM). METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed data about the correlation between outcomes and Fong's CRS from 1989 to 2010 for patients treated for CLM at the Severance Hospital. RESULTS: Of 566 patients, 232 received adjuvant treatment after liver resection. Of these patients, 185 (81%) had a low CRS (0-2) and 47 (19%) had a high CRS (3-5). Stratification into high and low CRS allowed significant distinction between Kaplan-Meier curves for outcome. The 5-year survival rate was 88.5% and 11.5% among patients with a low and high CRS, respectively (P < 0.001). Seventy patients with initially unresectable CLM underwent liver resection after tumor downsizing by induction chemotherapy. Shifting of the CRS from high to low (8 patients; 11.4%) improved disease-free survival and overall survival. CONCLUSION: High CRS is associated with worse survival after resection in resectable and unresectable disease. The CRS may be used for risk assessment when recommending oncological surgical timing in initially unresectable disease and treatment options for perioperative or adjuvant treatment in resectable disease.
