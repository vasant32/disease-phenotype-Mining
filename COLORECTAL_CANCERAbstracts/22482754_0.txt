 BACKGROUND: The activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM, CD166) has been reported to be involved in tumorigenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC) and to function as a cancer stem cell marker. Controversial data exist regarding the prognostic power of ALCAM expression in CRC. Here, we evaluate the expression of ALCAM in a cohort of CRC patients and its usage as a prognostic marker for survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue specimens from 299 patients with CRC treated between 1993 and 2006 were analyzed via ALCAM immunohistochemistry (clone MOG/07) using a tissue microarray. Results were correlated with clinical, histopathological, and patient survival data (Chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and log-rank test, respectively). Multivariate analysis also was performed (Cox regression). RESULTS: ALCAM is expressed in most primary (76%) and secondary (62%) CRC lesions (P = 0.014). Immunohistochemistry revealed an inverse association with tumor grading (P = 0.002) but not with any other clinical or histopathological data. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a significant overall survival benefit in the group of ALCAM-positive patients (P = 0.019). Multivariate analysis showed that ALCAM is an independent positive prognostic marker for overall survival (P = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: ALCAM expression is a positive prognostic marker for overall survival of CRC patients, and its detection might help to optimize the existing prognostic staging system. Elevated expression in higher differentiated tumors might indicate a potential role in the early steps of tumorigenesis, and its loss might be associated with reduced cellular adhesion, resulting in a higher metastatic potential of the tumor. Further studies must be conducted investigating these hypotheses.
