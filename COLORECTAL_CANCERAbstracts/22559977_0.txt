Uridine diphosphoglucuronate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) is the key hepatic detoxification enzyme involved in the biotransformation of many carcinogens implicated in the development of colon, breast, and prostate cancers in humans. A polymorphism in the UGT1A1 promoter containing a TA-repeat element [(TA)5-8TAA] is involved in the modulation of UGT1A1 transcriptional activity. The wild-type activity is associated with the (TA)6TAA allele (UGT1A1*1), whereas UGT1A1 expression decreases with the increase of the TA-repeat number. We hypothesize that the low-activity allele UGT1A1*28 with seven TA repeats is associated with a higher risk for colorectal cancer. Our study involved 168 patients with histopathologically confirmed sporadic colorectal cancer and a control group of 96 individuals with no personal history of colorectal cancer. We detected a higher frequency of UGT1A1*28 than the wild-type UGT1A1*1 allele in colorectal cancer patients as compared with that of controls (odds ratio [OR] = 1.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07-2.26, P = 0.021). The frequency of genotypes containing the UGT1A1*28 allele in the homozygous or heterozygous state was significantly higher than the frequency of the wild-type UGT1A1*1/*1 genotype in colorectal cancer patients as compared with controls (OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.19-3.34, P = 0.007). Our results indicate that the UGT1A1*28 allele is a risk factor for colorectal cancer in the Macedonian male population, whereas no significant risk was detected among women.
