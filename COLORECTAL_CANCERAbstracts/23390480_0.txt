Hereditary nonpoliposis colorectal cancers (HNPCC) make up 2-7% of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases. CRC's in these group of patients are usually located in proxymal colon. The incidence of syncronic metacron CRC is 18%. The incidence of having different hystopathological types for these group of tumors varies between 3-9%. APC, p53 and K-ras gene mutations may be seen in HNPCC's. The least frequent mutation is the mutation on K-ras gene. In this report, a syncronic metacron CRC with different hystopathological type and K-ras gene mutation localised in transverse and left colon that has developed on the basis of HNPCC is discussed.
