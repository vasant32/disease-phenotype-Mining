 PURPOSE: To analyze the patterns of recurrence and the prognostic impact of ovarian metastases (OM) in a population of women with colorectal peritoneal carcinomatosis (CRPC) treated with curative intent. METHODS: Data from all consecutive women with CRPC who underwent curatively intended complete cytoreductive surgery (CRS) plus intraperitoneal chemotherapy at our institution were retrieved from a prospective database. A bilateral oophorectomy or a complementary unilateral oophorectomy was systematically performed during CRS. RESULTS: From 1994 to 2009, among 105 women who underwent CRS plus intraperitoneal chemotherapy for CRPC, 62 (60 %) had OM. Women with and without OM had comparable peritoneal cancer index (PCI) scores (10 vs. 12, respectively, p = 0.09). After a median follow-up of 60 (range 5-145) months, median overall survival of women with OM did not differ statistically from that of women without OM (respectively, 36 and 40 months; p = 0.75). Relapses occurred in 82 % of the patients, distributed similarly between the two groups except for retroperitoneal lymph node recurrence, which occurred in 19 patients (18 %), including 18 with OM. The only predictive factor for a retroperitoneal relapse was a history of OM (p = 0.0012). CONCLUSIONS: Retroperitoneal lymph node recurrence seems to be linked to OM originating from colorectal cancer and could worsen the prognosis. A systematic lymphadenectomy could be evaluated in women with isolated OM or very limited peritoneal carcinomatosis to analyze the incidence of invaded lymph nodes and study its potential benefit on survival.
