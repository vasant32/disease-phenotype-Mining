 BACKGROUND/AIM: Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or mucosectomy is an interventional procedure for minimal invasive endoscopic removal of benign and malignant digestive tract tumors. Mucosectomy removes flat and sessile neoplasms, early colorectal cancer (CRC) confined to mucosa or submucosa and lateral spreading tumors. The aim of the study was to show our first experience in application of this procedure in everyday practice in regarding completeness and efficacy of the procedure, complication rate and incidence of recurrent adenomas. METHODS: In the prospective study 51 colorectal adenomas were removed in 44 patients by EMR. RESULTS: Single mucosectomy was done in 43 patients, while multiple (8) in one patient. Complete resection was obtained in all procedures. In 36 (68.62%) procedures "en block" resection was done, but in 15 (31.37%) procedures "piece meal" resection was performed. Synchronous colorectal tumors (benign or malignant) were detected in 20 (45.45%) patients. Moderate dysplasia was found in 30 (58.82%) adenomas, but high grade dysplasia in 9 (17.64%) of adenomas. Intramucosal CRC was detected in 11.77% of adenomas. A total of 37 (72.54%) advanced adenomas were removed. There were 3 (5.88%) of recurrent adenomas, 6-30 months after the EMR. Only one (2.2%) case of post procedure bleeding was observed. CONCLUSION: EMR is a safe and efficious method for removal of flat, sessile adenomas, as well as early CRC. EMR is a routine endoscopic procedure in everyday practice of interventional endoscopist.
