A 48-year-old man was referred to our hospital with the diagnosis of colon cancer with multiple hepatic metastases. After right hemicolectomy, the rapid progression of liver disease was treated with metronomic capecitabine and bevacizumab according to a study protocol. A gradual regression of metastatic lesions was observed during a 9-month treatment period. After conversion of liver disease to resectability, the histological examination disclosed the complete necrosis of all lesions, with the exception of small neoplastic foci inside a single nodule. The comparison of this type of histological findings with the classic sclero-hyaline pathological response, as well as its importance as indicator of response to antiangiogenic treatment, is discussed.
