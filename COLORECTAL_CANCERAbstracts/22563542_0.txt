McKittrick-Wheelock syndrome is a disorder caused by fluid and electrolyte hypersecretion from a colorectal tumor. To present the case of a patient with a giant rectal villous tumor with McKittrick-Wheelock syndrome who was successfully treated with laparoscopic surgery. The case of a 59-year-old man who came to the emergency department with syncope, prerenal azotemia, and electrolyte disturbances with a background of chronic diarrhea is reported. His condition was the result of fluid and electrolyte hypersecretion caused by rectal villotubular adenomas. Laparoscopic low anterior resection and subsequent volume and electrolyte replacement therapy resulted in complete recovery. A microscopic examination revealed multiple, well-differentiated adenocarcinomas arising in villotubular adenomas. Laparoscopic surgical resection is a feasible therapeutic modality for McKittrick-Wheelock syndrome.
