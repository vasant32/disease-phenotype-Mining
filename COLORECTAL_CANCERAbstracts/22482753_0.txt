 INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to analyze the impact of cryosurgery (CRYO) on liver metastases compared to other thermoablative techniques. In a rat liver metastases model, evidence for tumor cell spread was analyzed comparing CRYO, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and laser-induced thermotherapy (LITT). METHODS: In an experimental study, we compared cell spillage in the washout of isolated perfused rat livers undergoing thermal ablation. Within the same model, CC531-GFP rat liver tumors were treated with CRYO, RFA, or LITT and the number of vital tumor cells within the perfusate was measured. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-9) were analyzed after in vivo ablation of rat colorectal liver metastases in the third experimental model. RESULTS: Our data showed pronounced washout of cells after CRYO with a higher amount of intravascular cells and cell detritus compared to RFA and LITT. Only the effluent fluid of cryosurgery-treated livers revealed GFP-stained tumor cells. MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression was significantly higher after cryosurgery than after RFA and LITT. CONCLUSION: When using thermoablative techniques, intravascular metastatic cell spillage is highest in CRYO, and increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases may further facilitate tumor cell spread. Therefore, RFA and LITT may be preferable whenever surgical resection of liver tumors is impossible.
