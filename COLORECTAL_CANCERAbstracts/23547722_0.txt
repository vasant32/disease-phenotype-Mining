Debate surrounds the nature of colorectal cancers in younger patients and whether they are more likely to present with aggressive disease. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to examine whether a relationship exists between age and variables such as family history, mucinous tumours, metastases and final pathology. 41 patients under the age of 45 were diagnosed and operated for colorectal cancer between September 1998 and December 2010 in our centre. Nineteen patients were under the mean age of 35 years. There was no correlation between younger patients and metastatic disease (r= -0.129, p=0.440) or family history (r= -0.258, p=0.123). There was no correlation between age and Dukes staging (r= -0.052, p=0.756), tumour stage (r= -0.110, p=0.516), nodal status (r= -0.053, p=0.751), mucinous tumours (r=0.104, p=0.569) and cell differentiation (r= 0.046, p=0.787). Overall mortality was 26% and of those who survived 10% have metastatic disease. Median survival was 26 months after surgery. Younger patients under 45 appear to be a homogenous group in relation to colorectal tumour characteristics. Further longitudinal studies to examine the differences between this group and older people are needed.
