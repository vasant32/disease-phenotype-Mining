MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate mammalian gene expression by targeting mRNAs and have key roles in several cellular processes, including differentiation, development, apoptosis and cancer pathomechanisms. Our previous studies have confirmed that a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) gene is overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) tumors and SW480 cells. To study the potential mechanisms of APRIL gene in the occurrence and development of the CRC, herein, we investigated whether APRIL-knockdown had the inhibitory effect on the growth of SW480 cells and had the simultaneous expression changes of miRNAs and mRNAs by microarrays. Our results suggest that siRNA-APRIL can effectively inhibit the growth of SW480 cells in vitro and in vivo and several miRNAs via specific pathways might be involved in regulating the phenotype of loss-of-function in APRIL-knockdown SW480 cells. Thus, our study highlights the possible mechanisms of miRNA-target regulating the function of APRIL gene in CRC cells, moreover, siRNA-APRIL holds great promise as a novel gene therapy approach for APRIL- positive CRC treatment.
