BACKGROUND: The clinical significance of peritoneal lavage cytology for patients with gastric cancer is recognized, whereas that for patients with colorectal cancer remains controversial. The present study used a nationwide registry to clarify the prognostic significance of peritoneal lavage cytology in patients with colorectal cancer. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed factors associated with recurrence and survival in patients with T3-T4 colorectal cancer without distant metastasis taken from the nationwide registry of the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum between 1984 and 1999. RESULTS: Among 34,554 patients in this study, not all of whom received peritoneal lavage cytology, 35 had positive peritoneal lavage cytology. Gender (P = 0.0004), tumor location (P < 0.0001), histological grade (P < 0.0001), depth of tumor invasion (P < 0.0001), lymph node metastasis (P < 0.0001) and peritoneal cytology (P = 0.015) were risk factors for peritoneal recurrence. Multivariate analysis revealed that tumor location (P < 0.0001), histological grade (P < 0.0001), depth of tumor invasion (P < 0.0001) and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.0001) were independent risk factors for peritoneal metastasis. Gender (P < 0.0001), tumor location (P < 0.0001), age (P < 0.0001), histological grade (P < 0.0001), depth of tumor invasion (P < 0.0001), lymph node metastasis (P < 0.0001) and peritoneal cytology (P = 0.0004) were independent prognostic factors according to the Cox proportional hazards model. CONCLUSION: Positive peritoneal lavage cytology was associated with poorer survival in patients with stage II and III colorectal cancer. Positive cytology might be a good indicator of candidates for intensive adjuvant chemotherapy. The benefit of intensive adjuvant chemotherapy for such patients should be validated in prospective trials.
