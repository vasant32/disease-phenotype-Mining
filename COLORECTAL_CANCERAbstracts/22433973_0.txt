 OBJECTIVE: Serrated adenocarcinoma (SAC), proposed as a new pathologic type, arises predominantly in the right side of the colon and has a poorer prognosis than conventional colorectal carcinoma. The prognosis of colorectal carcinoma is variable in Dukes' B, so the aim of this study was to determine whether or not SAC has a poor prognosis in Dukes' B. METHODS: The study group comprised 64 patients who underwent surgery for colorectal carcinoma. We undertook a statistical analysis of the association of SAC and non-SAC with sex, age, histologic type, depth of tumor, location of tumor, venous invasion and lymphatic invasion. RESULTS: SACs were encountered in 17.5% of cases (n = 11). SAC had a less favorable 5-year survival than non-SAC (p = 0.0396 log-rank, Kaplan-Meier). The factors that achieved statistical significance in the univariate analysis were subsequently included in a multivariate analysis and we found that SAC was an independent factor (p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: SAC has a poor prognosis and is not affected by other factors confirming that SAC is an independently less favorable prognostic factor.
