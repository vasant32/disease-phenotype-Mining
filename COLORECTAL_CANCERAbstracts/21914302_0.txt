 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of transanal drainage tube followed by laparoscopic surgery in management of malignant colorectal obstruction. METHODS: From March 2007 to October 2010, 37 patients with colorectal cancer manifesting acute complete mechanical obstruction were treated by ileus tube drainage. After irrigation and drainage ranging from 4 to 10 days, the radical operations and anastomosis were performed by laparoscopy. RESULTS: The drainage tubes were successfully implanted in 34 patients. The decompression time of patients was (5.8 ± 1.6) d, ranging from 4 to 10 d. The abdominal pain and bloating symptoms were faded away after (3.8 ± 1.3) d (1 to 7 d) drainage. And comparing to that of patients when admission, abdominal circumference significantly reduced from (92 ± 7) cm to (84 ± 6) cm (P = 0.013) before surgery. Thirty-one cases were performed radical resection and anastomosis by laparoscopy after decompression. Postoperative recovery was smooth, and there was no serious complication. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic surgery followed decompression by transanal ileus tube is effective and safe for acute lower colorectal obstruction. Emergency surgery may be converted to limit surgery by this method. After appropriate bowel preparation, laparoscopic radical surgery and anastomosis is feasible.
