To minimize invasive surgery, we employed B ultrasound to guide the placement             of the catheters used in continuous circulatory hyperthermic intraperitoneal perfusion             chemotherapy (CHIPC) in malignant ascites treatment. Thirty-two patients with             malignant ascites were treated with CHIPC guided by B-mode ultrasound. Ascites             were originally from ovarian cancer (11 cases), gastric cancer (10 cases), colorectal             cancer (9 cases) and pancreatic cancer (2 cases). The CHIPC was carried out at             43˚C for 90 min with 0.9% saline solution as a carrier containing cisplatin and             doxorubicin or mitomycin-C as therapeutic reagents depending on the type of the             primary tumor. The therapeutic efficacy, postoperative complications and survival             period of these patients were assessed with follow-up examinations. Among all             participates to be assessed with ascites, 26 and 4 patients showed complete remission             (CR) and partial remission (PR) respectively, with an objective remission rate             (ORR) of 93.75%. The KPS scores were elevated by 23.1±9.0 after 3 sessions of             ultrasound guided CHIPC and the quality of life (QOF) of patients was significantly             improved (p<0.01). The median survival time was 9 months and 18 patients survived             between 3 and 30 months after CHIPC treatment. Additionally, patients with different             types of cancers significantly differed in the survival time (p<0.01). A novel             approach of using B ultrasound guided CHIPC for the treatment of malignant ascites             demonstrated satisfactory outcomes. The approach shows benefit in minimizing invasive             surgery, improving the patient QOF and prolonging survival time.
