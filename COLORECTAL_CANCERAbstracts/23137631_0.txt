 BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms of endothelial nitric oxide synthases (eNOS) have been shown to be associated with cancer susceptibility. However, the results of such studies are conflicting to date. We investigated whether polymorphisms of the eNOS gene correlated with patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), relative to healthy individuals. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the present study, we analyzed three polymorphisms of eNOS (-786T>C, 4a4b, and 894G>T) in 509 healthy controls and 528 patients with CRC. The genotyping of eNOS polymorphisms was performed using polymerase chain reaction or polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assays. RESULTS: We found that the TC+CC genotype of the -786T>C polymorphism was significantly associated with an increased risk of CRC compared with the TT genotype. Similarly, the GT+TT genotype of the 894G>T polymorphism was associated with an increased susceptibility to CRC. However, no evidence was found for any association between the 4a4b polymorphism and CRC risk. In addition, the C/4b/G (-786T>C/4a4b/894G>T) haplotype was significantly associated with increased risk of CRC and C/4b/T (-786T>C/4a4b/894G>T) haplotype was only detected in CRC patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the eNOS -786T>C and 894G>T polymorphisms may be associated with the development of CRC in the Korean population.
