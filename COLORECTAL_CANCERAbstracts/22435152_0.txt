Carcinoma of the large bowel is the fourth commonest cancer worldwide. The most frequent site for metastasis is the liver. Overall 30% of patients develop liver metastasis during the course of their illness; of these, 23% to 47% are synchronous lesions. These data are based on western studies. No data are published on patients with colorectal cancer from Egypt. We aimed to assess the incidence of colorectal liver metastasis in Egyptian patients and to evaluate the differences in the clinicopathological features and tumor behavior in patients with and without liver metastasis. One hundred forty eight patients were prospectively enrolled in the study. Patients were classified into metastatic group (n=78) and non metastatic group (n=70). In the two groups macroscopic features compared including: tumor size (2 cm, 2-5 cm, and >5 cm), site of primary tumor, side of liver involved, clinical symptoms and liver profile. Carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen (CA19.9) levels were recorded. At microscopy, tumor differentiation, invasion and nodal status were evaluated. No difference was found in the distribution of the primary site and size of the tumor. Jaundice, hepatomegaly and ascites were significantly higher in patients with liver metastases. Patients with liver metastasis had higher levels of CEA, CA19.9, higher frequency of vascular invasion and nodal involvement.
