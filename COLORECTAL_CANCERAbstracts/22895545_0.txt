Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide.             Molecular biomarkers could help to predict patient outcome and to identify patients             who benefit from adjuvant therapy. Pontin and Reptin are ATPases which are involved             in transcriptional regulation, DNA damage repair and regulation of cell proliferation.             Many interaction partners of Pontin and Reptin such as β-catenin and c-myc are             important factors in carcinogenesis. We hypothesized that Pontin and Reptin expression             may be a negative predictor for survival in colorectal carcinoma. Specimens from             115 patients with primary colon adenocarcinomas UICC stage III and primary rectal             adenocarcinomas UICC stage II and III curatively resected at the Department of             Surgery, Charité Berlin, were evaluated. Clinical follow-up data were complete             and mean follow-up time of patients was 51.8 months. We evaluated the expression             of Pontin, Reptin and Ki-67 by immunohistochemistry. Patients with Pontin-positive             carcinomas showed no differences in recurrence-free survival (p=0.109) and overall             survival (p=0.197). There were no differences in Reptin-positive carcinomas and             Ki-67-positive carcinomas in recurrence-free survival (p=0.443 and p=0.160) and             overall survival (p=0.477 and p=0.687). Patients with Pontin-positive colorectal             carcinomas receiving adjuvant therapy had a significantly worse recurrence-free             survival (p=0.008) and overall survival (p=0.011) than Pontin-negative patients             with adjuvant therapy. In UICC stage III, Pontin-positive colorectal carcinomas             had a significantly worse recurrence-free survival (p=0.028). Pontin-positivity             seems to be a negative predictor for response to adjuvant therapy in colorectal             cancer patients and may help to identify patients with adverse outcome in advanced             tumor stages.
