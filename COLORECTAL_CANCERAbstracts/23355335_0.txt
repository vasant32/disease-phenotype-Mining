Studies investigating the associations between Cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1) polymorphisms and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk report conflicting results. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the association between CYP2E1 gene Rsa I/Pst I, Dral T/A and 96-bp insertion polymorphisms and CRC susceptibility. Two investigators independently searched the Medline, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang, and Chinese Biomedicine Databases. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) for CYP2E1 polymorphisms and CRC were calculated in a fixed-effect model (the Mantel-Haenszel method) and a random-effects model (the DerSimonian and Laird method) when appropriate. Ultimately, 12, 5, and 4 studies were found to be eligible for meta-analyses of Rsa I/Pst I, Dral T/A, and 96-bp insertion polymorphisms, respectively. Our analysis suggested that the variant genotype of Rsa I/Pst I were associated with a significantly increased CRC risk (c2/c2 vs. c1/c1, OR = 1.36, 95 % CI = 1.04-1.77; recessive model, OR = 1.35, 95 % CI = 1.04-1.75). Moreover, similar results were observed between CYP2E1 96-bp insertion polymorphism and CRC risk (dominant model, OR = 1.25, 95 % CI = 1.07-1.45), while no association was observed between CYP2E1 Dral T/A polymorphism and CRC susceptibility in any genetic model. No publication bias was found in the present study. This meta-analysis shows that CYP2E1 Rsa I/Pst I and 96-bp insertion polymorphisms may be associated with CRC risk. The CYP2E1 Dral T/A polymorphism was not detected to be related to the risk for CRC.
