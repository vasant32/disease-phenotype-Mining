Metabolic syndrome (MS) and related disorders, including cancer, are steadily increasing in most countries of the world. However, mechanisms underlying the link between MS and colon carcinogenesis have yet to be fully elucidated. In this review article we focus on the relationships between various individual associated conditions (obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension) and colon cancer development, and demonstrate probable related factors revealed by in vivo and in vitro studies. Furthermore, molecules suggested to be involved in cancer promotion are addressed, and the potential for cancer prevention by targeting these molecules is discussed.
