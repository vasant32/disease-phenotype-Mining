 BACKGROUND: Published results addressing the treatment of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) vary widely with local recurrence rates of 2-40% and 5-year survival of 14-55%. The goal of this study was to analyze our 10-year experience with laparoscopic RFA. METHODS: From January 2000 to July 2010, 130 patients underwent laparoscopic RFA for CRLM. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess survival. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to identify factors associated with survival and recurrence. RESULTS: In this cohort, median survival was 40.4 months with 5-year survival of 28.8%. Overall, 9.2% of patients had a local recurrence (3.6% for tumors 3 cm or less). On univariate analysis, factors associated with decreased survival were BMI (P = 0.045), rectal primary (P = 0.005), and increased tumor size (P = 0.002). On multivariate analysis, increased tumor size (HR 1.29 [95% CI: 1.04-1.59]; P = 0.020) and bilobar disease (HR 2.06 [95% CI: 1.02-4.15]; P = 0.044) were associated with decreased survival. On univariate analysis, only BMI was found to be associated with disease recurrence (P = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that laparoscopic RFA can achieve a median survival of 40.4 months with a low local recurrence rate. Patients with tumors 3 cm or less have a decreased risk of local recurrence.
