OBJECTIVES:: To assess patterns of failure and factors affecting recurrence patterns in colorectal cancer patients treated with Y-labeled resin microspheres for metastatic liver disease. METHODS:: We retrospectively reviewed 30 colorectal patients treated with Yttrium-90 radioembolization and assessed follow-up computed tomography scans and positron emission tomography scans to determine disease outcomes. All patients were included in survival analysis. Twenty-six patients with hepatic metastases were assessed for patterns of failure after radioembolization treatment and grouped into 3 patterns: (1) hepatic; (2) extrahepatic; and (3) intrahepatic and extrahepatic. RESULTS:: The median overall survival and progression-free survival for all colorectal patients treated with radioembolization was 9.4 and 3.2 months, respectively. Overall survival and progression-free survival were not significantly different between patterns of failure (P=0.43 and 0.26, respectively). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated a trend toward the predictive value of tumor volume in determining patterns of failure. Smaller tumor volumes had a higher predictive probability for extrahepatic failure than larger tumor volumes (P=0.057). Tumor volumes <300 mL were predictive for extrahepatic failure patterns compared with hepatic recurrence (P=0.046). CONCLUSIONS:: Radioembolization with Y-labeled resin microspheres continues to be an effective salvage treatment for colorectal liver metastases. Analysis of patterns of radiologic failure demonstrated that patients treated by radioembolization develop a greater proportion of extrahepatic failure. Tumor volumes >300 mL were predictive for hepatic recurrence, suggesting that increased dosing or retreatment of these lesions may lead to improved hepatic control of disease and better patient outcomes.
