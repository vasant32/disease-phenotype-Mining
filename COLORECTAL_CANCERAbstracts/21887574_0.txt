 UNLABELLED: Concurrent colorectal cancer (CRC) and vascular disease, such as abdominal aortic aneurysm, represents a challenging clinical situation. Both lesions may lead to the demise of the patient and therefore should be treated. Endovascular techniques may enhance decision-making and even permit single-stage treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of patients in a university department with extensive endovascular experience. Between 2004 and 2010, seven patients with synchronous vascular disease and colorectal cancer were identified. RESULTS: The mean age was 73 years, and all patients were men. Five patients had concurrent CRC and aneurysmal disease. Two had synchronous critical carotid artery stenosis and CRC. All vascular lesions were treated with endovascular techniques. All CRC were resected with open techniques. In four patients, endovascular repair followed by staged CRC resection was performed. In three patients, single-stage procedures were performed. There was one perioperative death, for a mortality of 14.3% in our series. There were no graft infections. CONCLUSIONS: Priority of treating concurrent vascular disease and CRC remains a dilemma. Combined treatment with a single-stage procedure is feasible. Risk of graft infection may be lower than expected.
