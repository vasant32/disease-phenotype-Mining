To better understand the relationships between chemical exposures and human cancer causation, incidence data for human cancer types were identified and pancreatic and colorectal cancers were studied in-depth to assess whether data supporting the causation of pancreatic or colorectal tumors by chemicals in rodents is predictive of causation by the same chemicals of the same tumors in humans. A search of the Carcinogenic Potency Database, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) technical report database, and the published literature identified 38 and 39 chemicals reported to cause pancreatic and colorectal tumors, respectively, in mice or rats. For each of these chemicals, searches were conducted of the International Agency for Research on Cancer monographs, the NTP Report on Carcinogens, and the published literature for evidence of induction of the same tumors in humans. Based on this evaluation, no conclusive evidence was identified to suggest that chemicals reported to cause pancreatic or colorectal tumors in rodents also cause these tumors in humans. These findings suggest that pancreatic tumor data from mouse and rat bioassays are of limited utility with regard to predicting similar tumor induction in humans. For colorectal cancer, a lack of correlation was noted for the vast majority of chemicals.
