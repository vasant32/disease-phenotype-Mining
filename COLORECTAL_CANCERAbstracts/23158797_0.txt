 OBJECTIVE: To explore the causes of postoperative anastomotic leakage of colorectal cancer. METHODS: A total of 1462 cases with colorectal cancer undergoing laparoscopic operation and intestinal anastomosis at our department over the last decade were analyzed retrospectively. Data analysis was performed with SPSS 13.0. The risk factors were analyzed by binary Logistic regression while the annual incidence of anastomotic leakage by trend χ(2) test. RESULTS: Thirty anastomotic leakage occurred in 1462 cases with an incidence rate of 2.1%. There were significant correlations of anastomotic leakage with body built, tumor location, tumor size, operation time (χ(2) = 6.117, 50.167, 36.693, 4.481, P = 0.013, 0.000, 0.000, 0.034). However, there was no correction with gender, age or histological type (P = 0.871, 0.775, 1.000). Then the significance check of binary Logistic regression equation was performed. Tumor location was an independent risk factor of postoperative anastomotic leakage for colorectal cancer. The relative risk was 2.056. The annual incidence of anastomotic leakage was statistically insignificant (χ(2) = 1.827, P = 0.176). And the difference was. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of anastomotic leakage after colorectal cancer surgery is significantly correlated with body built, tumor location, tumor size and operation time. And tumor location below peritoneal reversal is an independent risk factor of anastomotic leakage.
