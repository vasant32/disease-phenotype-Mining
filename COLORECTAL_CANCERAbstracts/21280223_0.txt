Many biologically active agents exert a pleiotropic response in cells and tissues. This presents challenges in descriptive and comparative analysis of the proteome in response to these agents. Although free-flow electrophoresis has been applied in a number of proteomic studies as a protein separation technique, the combination of free-flow electrophoresis and DIGE has not yet been investigated for comparative proteomic analysis. In this study, we have compared the effects of butyrate on HT29 colorectal cancer cells with a particular focus on apoptosis and describe the utility of a novel approach combining free-flow electrophoresis with DIGE to identify differentially expressed proteins. We verify the results obtained by the combined free-flow electrophoresis and DIGE approach with Western blot analysis of selected proteins. We also report for the first time the regulation of a number of proteins by butyrate in HT29 colorectal cells including peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A (cyclophilin A) and profilin-1.
