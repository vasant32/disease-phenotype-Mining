 OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the epidemiological profile of colorectal cancer in Gabon and to describe its clinical and laboratory features. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective monocentric descriptive study was based on all cases of colorectal cancers managed at the Libreville Hospital Center during the 10-year period from September 1996 to September 2006. Study endpoints included epidemiological characteristics, anatomoclinical forms and diagnostic methods. RESULTS: A total of 51 cases were included. Mean patient age at time of diagnosis was 48 years. The sex ratio was 1.3 with a female predominance. Mean duration of symptoms ranged from 6 months to 1 year. Abdominal pain and digestive disturbances were the most common manifestations. Lower digestive-tract endoscopy was performed in 49 patients. The tumor was located at rectosigmoid junction in 80% of cases. Lieberk√ºhnian adenocarcinoma accounted for 98% of cases. CONCLUSION: Initially described in industrialized countries, colorectal cancer is now being reported in developing regions, even though data from the literature and Gabonese cancers register (1984-93) indicate otherwise. It often involves young adults. The rectum was the most frequent site in this study. Delayed diagnosis is the main reason for poor prognosis. Education to improve awareness of early clinical signs as well improvement of diagnostic facilities should allow early detection and better prognosis of colorectal cancer in Africa.
