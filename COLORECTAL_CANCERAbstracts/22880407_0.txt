Colorectal adenocarcinoma and its lymph node metastases from 72 patients and 14 control samples were studied. Expression of adhesive molecules - E-cadherin and beta-catenin, antiadhesive molecule - tenascin C and tumor metastasis suppressor KAI-1 (CD82) were studied by immunohistochemistry. The expression of E-cadherin and beta-catenin, tenascin C and KAI-1 was significantly different in adenocarcinoma and control samples. The expression of E-cadherin, tenascin C and KAI-1 was diverse in primary tumor compared to lymph node metastases. The analysis of current data showed the association of E-cadherin expression with stage of disease and depth of invasion, such as the correlation of beta-catenin nuclear expression and tenascin C expression with depth of adenocarcinoma invasion. These data may be a useful indicator of disease progression.
