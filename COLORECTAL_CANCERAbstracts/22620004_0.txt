Discovery of usable molecular biomarkers is the step closer to a realization of personalized therapy for patients with colorectal cancer(CRC). Herein we present an update of the most recent data on promising biological prognostic and/or predictive markers, including microsatellite instability(MSI) and KRAS/BRAF mutations. Additionally, we propose a new genetic classification for CRC based on MSI and KRAS/BRAF mutation status (a 2 x 3 matrix). The 2 x 3 matrix is constructed of 6 cells that are made by [MSI/non-MSI] x [BRAF mutant/KRAS mutant/wild type of the both genes]. All of CRC including Lynch syndrome could be classified without overlapping into the 6 cells. More interestingly, each cell has each promising biological prognostic and/or predictive feature, which will help clinicians to make personalized treatment strategy for each CRC patient.
