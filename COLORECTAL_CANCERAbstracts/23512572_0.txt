AIM: To evaluate the impact of contrast-enhanced computed tomography colonography (CE-CTC) on laparoscopic surgery planning in patient with stenosing colorectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-nine patients with endoscopically proven colorectal cancer underwent CE-CTC, after incomplete conventional colonoscopy. Two experienced radiologists evaluated site, length, and TNM staging of colorectal cancers on three-dimensional double contrast enema-like views, 2D axial and multiplanar reconstructions. All the patients underwent colorectal resection and surgery bulletin, pathology of surgical specimens, and radiological follow-up at about 8 months were used as reference standard. RESULTS: The detection rate of colorectal cancer was 100 % (75/75); CE-CTC allowed for a diagnosis of a synchronous colorectal cancer in five patients (7 %). CE-CTC correctly judged the site of the lesions in all the cases; clinically significant localization errors at conventional colonoscopy were noted in 3 out of 69 patients (4 %). Additional colonic polyps greater than 6 mm in diameter were found in 21 out of 69 patients (30 %); in two patients (3 %) the surgeon performed an enlarged colectomy to include synchronous polyps proximal to colorectal cancer. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy were for T1-T2 vs. T3-T4: 96 %, 71 %, 92 %, 87 %, and 91 %, respectively; for N: 94 %, 42 %, 64 %, 86 %, and 70 %; for M: 100 %, 100 %, 83 %, 100 %, and 97 %. There were no complications associated with CE-CTC. CONCLUSION: Information given by CE-CTC concerning colorectal cancer location and synchronous colonic cancers and polyps changed the laparoscopic surgical strategy in almost 14 % of patients.
