This study aimed to investigate the involvement of c-erbB-2, encoded by             the receptor tyrosine kinase ERBB2 gene, in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer             and to validate its potential as an anticancer target. Immunohistochemical and             histopathological analyses were applied in tissue samples derived from 80 colorectal             cancer patients. ERBB2 stable small hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown in HT29 human             colorectal cancer cells was confirmed by RT-PCR and western blotting. Cell cycle             profile and apoptosis were measured using PI or AnnexinÂ V-PI dual staining. A             significant correlation between ERBB2 levels and Dukes' stage of colorectal cancer,             in both the primary malignancy and lymph node metastatic tissues, was observed.             ERBB2-depleted HT-29 cells exhibited increased sensitivity to radiation compared             to control cells, likely due to enhanced G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.             ERBB2 may be involved in the malignancy and metastasis of colorectal cancer. Overexpressed             ERBB2 may constitute a potential target for colorectal cancer therapy.
