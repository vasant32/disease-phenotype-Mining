 PURPOSE: To identify symptoms/distress among patients with colorectal cancer undergoing chemotherapy, from the viewpoint of the next of kin, and to establish whether there are any barriers to reporting these problems. METHODS: Individual face-to-face interviews with fourteen next of kin were conducted. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyse the transcripts. RESULTS: Three areas were identified: symptoms presented, barriers to reporting symptoms/distress, and influences on life for the next of kin. Nine symptoms were raised as most common by the next of kin. Almost all the next of kin denied that they had experienced any barriers to reporting symptoms/distress but some did exist, namely barriers to proper communication and barriers of time. The next of kin made another interpretation of barriers; they did not interpret it as hinder or obstacle. All next of kin talked to a large extent about how the patient's disease and treatment affected them as next of kin. It affected them psychologically, they had to re-valuate their life, and it influenced their social life. CONCLUSIONS: The symptoms reported during chemotherapy were similar to those found in other studies on patients. Barriers to reporting symptoms were mentioned, but not to a great extent. Although it was not the main purpose of the study, the next of kin raised concerns about the patient's disease and treatment and how it influenced next of kin life.
