 OBJECTIVE: Age differences in reactions to cancer are established but poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to apply the theoretical model of strength and vulnerability integration (SAVI; Charles, 2010) to understand age-related patterns in emotional experiences and cancer appraisals among people diagnosed with colorectal cancer. METHODS: Individuals recently diagnosed with colorectal cancer (N = 139; 28-89 years-old) completed measures of positive and negative affect, depressive symptoms, and appraisals about cancer at four time points: baseline (prior to colorectal cancer surgery), 6-, 12-, and 18-months postsurgery. Multilevel modeling examined changes in affective experience and appraisals over time, across age, and the interaction of time by age. RESULTS: Negative affect decreased more rapidly over time among older adults than younger adults, p < .05, but positive affect was reasonably stable and unrelated to age. Depressive symptoms were also fairly stable over time, but consistently higher among younger adults, p < .01. Older age was significantly related to lower threat appraisals and greater levels of challenge, p < .01. Threat, but not challenge, mediated the age-by-time interaction predicting negative affect. CONCLUSIONS: Older age was related to lower levels of depressive symptoms and negative affect. Older adults also reported more adaptive appraisals of their cancer, which accounted for their more rapid decline in negative affect compared to younger adults. Overall, SAVI is a useful model for understanding age-related patterns in emotional well-being and appraisals in the context of colorectal cancer.
