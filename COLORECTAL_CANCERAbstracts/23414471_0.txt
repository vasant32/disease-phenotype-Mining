Colorectal cancer (CRC) is predominantly a disease of economically developed countries, with many lifestyle-related risk factors proposed that contribute to a higher incidence. These risk factors include obesity, especially visceral fat, lack of physical activity, high consumption of red and processed meat, alcohol and a low intake of dietary fiber. Many population-based studies suggest that a combination of these lifestyle-related risk factors not only increases the incidence of CRC, but also contributes to an increased risk of CRC recurrence after the initial diagnosis. In this article we have reviewed various scientific studies that link lifestyle risk factors with CRC and we propose lifestyle modification as an adjunct intervention to surgery and chemotherapy in patients with early stage and locally advanced CRC.
