 OBJECTIVE: To analyze correlates of adherence to colorectal cancer screening with biennial fecal occult blood testing in asymptomatic individuals aged 50 to 69 years. METHODS: A cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted among people (n = 1,193) invited to participate in at least two successive rounds of a population-based colorectal cancer screening program in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat (Barcelona, Spain). Subjects were classified according to their adherence to colorectal cancer screening guidelines (non-adherent, irregular adherent and totally adherent). Independent variables were sociodemographic variables, self-perceived health, attitudes and beliefs regarding colorectal cancer and preventive activities. Binary and politomous logistic regression models were performed. RESULTS: Of the individuals invited to participate in the screening program, 14.4% were adherent to screening recommendations and 18.4% were occasionally adherent. Significant differences were found in beliefs and attitudes regarding colorectal cancer and its early detection among adherent and non-adherent individuals. Sharing the decision to participate in screening with a family member increased adherence by nine- and tweve-fold. A positive perception of the screening process was a facilitator to adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Attitudes and beliefs regarding colorectal cancer and its early detection, as well as familial support, are associated with initial participation in colorectal cancer screening but do not affect the persistence of preventive behavior over time.
