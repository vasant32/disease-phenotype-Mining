Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of death from cancer. The MET receptor tyrosine kinase and/or its ligand HGF are frequently amplified or overexpressed in CRC. It is known that tyrosine phosphorylated proteins are involved in progression and metastasis of colorectal cancer; however, little is known about the MET phospho-proteome in CRC. High resolution mass spectrometry was used to characterize immunoaffinity-purified, phosphotyrosine (pY)-containing tryptic peptides of the MET-expressing CRC cell model, DLD1. A total of 266 unambiguously identified pY sites spanning 168 proteins were identified. Quantification of mass spectrometry ion currents identified 161 pY sites, including many not previously linked to MET signaling, that were modulated in abundance by HGF stimulation. Overlay of these data with protein-protein interaction data sets suggested that many of the identified HGF-modulated phospho-proteins may be directly or indirectly associated with MET. Analysis of pY sequence motifs indicated a prevalence of Src family kinase consensus sequences, and reciprocal signaling between Src and MET was confirmed by using selective small molecule inhibitors of these kinases. Therefore, using quantitative phospho-proteomics profiling, kinase modulation by ligand and inhibitors, and data integration, an outline of the MET signaling network was generated for the CRC model.
