 AIM: To evaluate the prognostic value of preoperative serum carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) level in patients with colorectal cancer. METHODS: This retrospective study included 125 colorectal cancer patients aged from 14 to 87 years, surgically treated between January 2001 and December 2006. Preoperative serum CEA was measured by chemiluminescence assay. RESULTS: within the patients, 57 were males and 68 females. They have tumours classified Dukes A in 2 patients, B in 24 patients, C in 53 patients and Dukes D in 46 patients. Median follow-up period was 24 months (range, 4 - 72 months). The relapse-free survival was significantly higher in patients with CEA < 5 ng/ml compared to CEA ³ 5 ng/ml, (p < 0.0001). We observed significant differences in relapse-free survival between patients with CEA < 5 ng/ml and those with CEA ³ 5 ng/ml among patients classified as Dukes stage B (p=0.007) and C (p < 0.0001). However, there was no significant difference in relapse-free survival among those classified as Dukes stage D. Cox multivariate analysis demonstrated that preoperative serum CEA level was a significant independent prognostic factor for relapse-free survival (hazard ratio: 6.49, 95% CI, 3.09 to 13.62, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Preoperative serum CEA is a reliable predictor factor for recurrence in patients with CRC. CEA might be used in staging system and will be useful for therapeutic orientation in patients undergoing curative resection of CRC.
