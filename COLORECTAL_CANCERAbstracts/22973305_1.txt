Introduction. 60% of patients operated for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) will develop recurrent disease and some may be candidates for a repeated liver resection. The study aimed to evaluate differences in intraoperative blood loss and complications comparing the primary and the repeated liver resection for metastases of colorectal cancer (CRC), as well as to evaluate differences in long-time follow-up. Method. 32 patients underwent 34 repeated liver resections due to recurrence of CRLM an studied retrospectively to identify potential differences between the primary and the repeat resections. Results. There was no 30-day postoperative mortality or postoperative hospital deaths. The median blood loss at repeat resection (1850 mL) was significantly (P = 0.014) higher as compared to the primary liver resection (1000 mL). This did not have any effect on the rate of complications, even though increased bleeding in itself was a risk factor for complications. There were no differences in survival at long-term follow-up. Discussion. A repeated liver resection for CRLM was associated with an increased intraoperative bleeding as compared to the first resection. Possible explanations include presence of adhesions, deranged vascular anatomy, more complicated operations and the effects on the liver by chemotherapy following the first liver resection. 30 out of 32 patients had only one reresection of the liver.
