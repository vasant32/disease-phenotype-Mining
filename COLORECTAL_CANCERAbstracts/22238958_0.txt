Comparative analysis of using tumor markers in 159 patients with colorectal cancer was made. Carcinoembryonal antigen, skin reaction of hypersensitivity of slow type with autologous modified lymphocytes and a diagnostic test of tumor growth were used as oncomarkers. Each of three markers may be used for preoperative staging of colorectal cancer, postoperative monitoring of patients and determination of the disease prognosis. An individual approach of assessment of the oncomarker level at different stages of examining the patient is recommended.
