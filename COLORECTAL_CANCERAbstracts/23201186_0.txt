 OBJECTIVE: To assess stakeholders' perceptions (i.e. patients, relatives, the public, and professionals) about results of the Valencian Community Cancer Plan (POCV). METHODS: Qualitative analysis (34 participants in 2 interview groups, and 37 participants in 4 focus groups) and quantitative analysis (470 opinion surveys) was combined in a descriptive study. RESULTS: The POCV's existence is highlighted as a positive factor. It has managed to send the message that "cancer can be cured" to the population. The key aims have been defined, criteria have been unified, and there have been achieved the Tumor Committees contribute most to make a multidisciplinary care. The plan is considered innovative, especially because the Genetic Counseling Program was included. Citizens leaders and patient associations find the Breast Cancer Program as the best known and the most valued, while the Colorectal Cancer Program is the least known. In both methodologies, qualitative groups and the online survey conducted on the professionals, it is concluded that the Tumor Committees, the vaginal cytology recommendation for cervical cancer prevention, and the message transmission that "cancer can be cured" are positively assessed. CONCLUSIONS: POCV 07-10 assessments are generally positive, with occasional exceptions that are clearly identified. The qualitative and quantitative information obtained in the different analyses is almost coincident.
