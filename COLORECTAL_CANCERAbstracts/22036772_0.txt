 PURPOSE: This study reports the uptake rate of colorectal cancer screening among Chinese people aged 50 or above and the identified factors associated with the likelihood of undergoing such screening. METHODS: A cross-sectional population-based telephone survey was conducted in Hong Kong during the period 2 to 28 May 2007. The survey covered demographics, perceived health status and susceptibility to cancer, utilisation of complementary medicine, family history of cancer and cancer screening behaviour. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 2004 Hong Kong Chinese residents aged 50 or older (response rate = 66.6%). The uptake rate of a fecal occult blood test and a colonoscopy was 12% and 19% respectively. Factors associated with colorectal cancer screening behaviour included: male participants, ex-smokers, with cancer or other serious disease, a family history of cancer, perceived health status fair or poor, regular visits to a doctor to look after health, and utilisation of complementary medicine. CONCLUSIONS: The uptake rate of this study population was low though an increasing trend did appear. Heath education and promotion programmes may focus on these identified factors to facilitate colorectal cancer screening in a Chinese population.
