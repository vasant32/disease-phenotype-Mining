 BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyze factors contributing to prolonged postoperative ileus (POI) after elective bowel resection in patients with colorectal cancer. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of patients operated on for colorectal cancer during 2006-2009. Patients with abdominal procedures and bowel resection without anastomotic leakage were included. Prolonged POI was defined as no flatus by postoperative day (POD) 6, with or without intolerance to oral intake by POD 6. Variables studied included demographics, prior medical conditions, details of the surgical procedure, and hospital stay. RESULTS: A total of 773 patients met the inclusion criteria. POI occurred in 15.9%. The mean hospital stay was 11 days without POI and 20 days for POI patients (P < 0.001). Factors associated with POI in the univariate analysis were ASA III-IV (P < 0.005), male sex (P < 0.004), smoking (P < 0.015), chronic pulmonary disease (COPD) (P < 0.002), rectal cancer (P < 0.02), and ileostomy (P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed male sex [odds ratio (OR) 1.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-3.5]; COPD (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.25-31.0), and ileostomy (OR 1.9; 95% CI 1.23-3.07) as risk factors for POI. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of POI seems increased in patients with preoperative COPD and patients with an ileostomy, especially in men. Consideration of these factors could be important for the prevention and treatment of POI.
