 PURPOSE: Up to 20 % of colorectal cancer patients develop recurrent disease despite standardized surgical techniques and multimodal treatment strategies. Radical resection is the central component of curative therapy in these cases. The aim of this study was to evaluate treatment results in patients with locoregionally recurrent colorectal cancer. METHODS: From January 1995 to December 2007, surgery was performed for recurrent colorectal cancer in 82 patients who had undergone curative (R0) resection of their primary tumor. Assessment included patient, tumor and treatment characteristics, postoperative complications, and time without re-recurrence; recurrence-free and overall survival rates were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Resection was performed in 60 of the 82 patients (73 %), repeat R0 resection in 52 % (31/60). Patients had a postoperative morbidity of 39 % (31/82), a relaparotomy rate of 13 % (11/82), and a lethality of 7 % (6/82). Forty-eight percent of all surgically-treated patients received a permanent stoma. Re-recurrence was seen in 52 % (16/31). R0 resection was associated with a 5-year survival rate of 35 % (11/31). CONCLUSIONS: Extensive reinterventions often enable repeat R0 resection. Despite relevant morbidity, the lethality appears to be acceptable. Decisive for the prognosis is re-recurrence.
