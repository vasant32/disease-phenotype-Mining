 PURPOSE: Tumor recurrence of colorectal cancers (CRC) is generally followed up by analyses of the serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. However, recent evidence suggests that tumor recurrence can also be visualized by 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) in patients with normal CEA levels. We retrospectively evaluated the diagnostic performance of FDG-PET/CT in patients with suspected recurrence of CRC by comparing PET/CT performance in patients with normal CEA levels with PET/CT performance in patients with elevated CEA levels. METHODS: A total of 235 patients with CRC who had been treated with surgery and/or chemotherapy/radiotherapy underwent PET/CT for the detection of tumor recurrence. The patients [96 females and 139 males; age (mean ± SD) 59.9 ± 12.6 years; range 18-85] were divided into 2 groups based on whether their CEA levels were normal (<5 ng/ml) (Group 1, n = 118) or elevated (>5 ng/ml) (Group 2, n = 117). All of the patients had suspected recurrence based on raised CEA levels, clinical symptoms, and/or tumor detection using other imaging modalities. RESULTS: Of the 235 patients, 172 (73.1 %) had disease recurrence confirmed by a pathological examination (either biopsy or surgical exploration) or clinical follow-up studies. The FDG-PET/CT study yielded a true positive in detecting recurrence in 169 (71.9 %) patients, a true negative in 53 (22.5 %) patients, a false negative in 3 (1.2 %) patients and a false positive in 10 (4.2 %) patients. CRC recurrence was detected in 64.4 % (76/118) and 88 % (103/117) patients in Group 1 and Group 2 with FDG-PET/CT, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy of the FDG-PET/CT study for establishing recurrence were 100, 84, 89.4, 100 and 93.2 %, respectively, for Group 1; by contrast, these parameters were 97.1, 84.6, 98, 78.5 and 95.7 %, respectively, for Group 2. The number of patients with hepatic and extra-hepatic metastases, such as lung and abdominal lymph node metastasis, detected with FDG-PET/CT was significantly different in Group 1 than in Group 2; however, the number of patients with local recurrence and peritoneal implants detected with FDG-PET/CT was not different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: FDG-PET/CT can accurately detect tumor recurrence in patients with suspected recurrent CRC, even for patients with normal CEA levels.
