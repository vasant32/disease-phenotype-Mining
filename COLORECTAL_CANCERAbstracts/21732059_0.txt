Lung cancer metastasis-related protein 1 (LCMR1) is a critical subunit of the mediator complex, and plays an important role in the elaborate regulation of gene transcription. However, the functional role of LCMR1 in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) has not been clarified. In this study, LCMR1 expression in CRC specimens was quantified by using the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method. The effect of downregulation of LCMR1 by lentivirus-mediated small hairpin RNA (shRNA) on CRC cell proliferation and tumorigenesis was explored. There was a higher expression of LCMR1 in CRC tissue in comparison with adjacent normal colon tissue (P < 0.05). LCMR1 gene was effectively knocked down in human CRC RKO and DLD-1 cells that infected with lentivirus delivering shRNA against LCMR1, which resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation and augmentation of G0/G1 phase proportion. Moreover, the tumorigenicity of RKO cells was also dramatically inhibited after LCMR1 was knocked down. In conclusion, our results suggest that LCMR1 promotes CRC cell growth, and lentivirus-mediated silencing of LCMR1 may contribute to the gene therapy for CRC.
