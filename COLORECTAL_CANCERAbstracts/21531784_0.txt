 BACKGROUND: Previous studies investigating the prognostic role of mucinous histology of colorectal cancer produced conflicting results. This retrospective analysis was carried out in order to explore whether mucinous adenocarcinoma (MC) is associated with a comparatively worse prognosis than that of nonmucinous adenocarcinoma (NMC) for patients undergoing curative resection for stage II and III colon cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study involved 1025 unselected patients who underwent curative surgery for sporadic colon cancer and follow-up procedures at six different oncology departments. RESULTS: MCs accounted for 17.4% (n=178) of tumours. Patients with MC had 5- and 8-year overall survival rates of 78.6% and 68.8%, respectively, compared with 72.3% and 63.8%, respectively, for patients with nonmucinous tumours. Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model showed that the clinically significant prognostic factors were stage of disease and adjuvant chemotherapy. No statistically significant interaction between mucinous histology and adjuvant chemotherapy was found. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with stage II and III colon cancer who underwent curative surgery, mucinous histology has no significant correlation with prognosis compared with NMC. This retrospective analysis suggests a comparable benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy for MC compared with NMC.
