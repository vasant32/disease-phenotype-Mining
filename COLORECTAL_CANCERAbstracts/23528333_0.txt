Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-associated morbidity and mortality across the world. Every year many patients died from the advanced colorectal cancer. We had tried our best to stop the progress by the chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but the process has not stopped. And we just can use the target drug to extend the survival time of the patient who is in advanced stage. It is said that the circulating tumor cells, distributed in the peripheral blood, is the initial material leading to metastases formation. And Anterior gradient 2 is a biomarker of these cells. It shows an enormous role in the process of cancer's occurrence, development and metastasis. It may be a useful target for us to prevent colorectal cancer from progress. And it may be a new way to treat the colorectal cancer.
