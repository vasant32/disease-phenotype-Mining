Accumulating data indicate that some microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) can function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes and as such are important in cancer development. We previously reported that miR-143 and -145 are frequently downregulated in colon adenomas and cancers, acting as tumor suppressors. In this present study, we investigated the relationship between the downregulation of the miR-143/145 cluster and genetic aberrations of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), which are early genetic events in the development of colorectal tumors. The expression levels of both miRs were determined by performing real-time PCR on tissue samples of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), colorectal adenoma, colorectal cancer, and paired non-tumorous tissues. Also, the expression of C- or N-terminus of the APC protein and that of the p53 protein in these tissues were examined immunohistochemically. Our data clearly indicated that the decreased expression of miR-143 and -145 frequently occurred before APC gene aberrations. The downregulation of miR-143 and -145 is thus an important genetic event for the initiation step in colorectal tumor development.
