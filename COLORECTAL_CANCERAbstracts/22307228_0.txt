Recent studies have shown that transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) signaling             plays important roles in the redox system in benign and malignant cells. Whether             TGF-β mediates an antioxidative damage response in colorectal cancer cells is             largely unknown. Herein, using the human colorectal cancer cell lines we found             that TGF-β1 induced glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1) expression and enzyme activity,             and that the upregulation of GPx-1 by TGF-β1 could protect colorectal cell lines             from H2O2-induced oxidation damage. Further, we used loss- and gain-function approaches             to elucidate the underlying mechanism and found that TGF-β1 induced GPx-1 through             activation of the TGF-β receptor type I (TGF-βRI)/Smad2/extracellular-signal-regulated             kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)/hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) signaling pathway. This             cascade could be blocked by the TGF-βRI inhibitor or ERK1/2 inhibitor. Taken together,             our data demonstrated that TGF-β1 induced GPx-1 expression and enzymatic activity             via the TGF-βRI/Smad2/ERK1/2/HIF-1α signaling pathway, suggesting a novel antioxidative             protective function of TGF-β1 in colorectal cancer cells.
