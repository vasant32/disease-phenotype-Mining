Stage 0 colorectal cancer was found only in the innermost lining of the colon and rectum. Treatments for an early stage colorectal cancer were available including endoscopic polypectomy, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and trans-anal or -sacral local excision, laparoscopy-assisted colectomy and open colectomy. Our study indicated that endoscopic therapy for the early stage colorectal cancer was more advantageous than the conventional operative treatment. Although EMR should be applied for intramucosal carcinomas, 11 intramucosal carcinomas were treated by a surgical resection due to several limitations at our institution.
