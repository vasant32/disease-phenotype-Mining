The prognostic impact of distinct KRAS mutations in colorectal carcinomas is not fully characterized. We hypothesized that the prognostic impact of KRAS mutations is modulated by KRAS mutant allele-specific imbalance (MASI). KRAS MASI was assessed by sequencing electropherograms in KRAS-mutated colorectal carcinomas (N = 394, prospectively tested). The mechanism of KRAS MASI was studied by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH; N = 50). FISH showed that KRAS MASI developed by chromosome 12 hyperploidy (9/18, 50%) or KRAS amplification (1/18, 5.5%). KRAS MASI was more common in tumors with KRAS codon 13 than with codon 12 mutations [24/81, 30% vs. 54/313, 17%; odds ratio (OR), 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-3.5; p = 0.01]. KRAS MASI was correlated with overall survival (N = 358, median follow-up = 21 months). In a multivariate analysis, KRAS codon 13 MASI was an independent adverse prognostic factor (compared to codon 13 mutants without MASI combined with all codon 12 mutants; adjusted hazard ratio, 2.2, 95% CI: 1.2-3.9; p = 0.01). KRAS MASI arises through chromosome 12 hyperploidy or KRAS amplification and, when affects KRAS codon 13, is associated with worse overall survival.
