 AIM: To evaluate whether contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) might also be used for response prediction and early response evaluation in patients receiving bevacizumab based chemotherapy for metastasized colorectal cancer. METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients with non primary resectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer underwent CEUS before treatment (CEUS date 1) and before the second (CEUS date 2) and fourth (CEUS date 3) cycle of bevacizumab based chemotherapy. Three parameters [PEAK, Time to peak (TTP) and RISE RATE]were correlated with radiological response. RESULTS: For neoadjuvant purpose a reduction of tumour mass was required to assume clinical response. Based on these response criteria there was a significant (P < 0.001) correlation in TTP between metastases of responders (9.08 s) and non-responders (14.76 s) archived on CEUS date 1. By calculating a standardized quotient (metastases divided by normal liver tissue) we were able to define a cut off, predicting response with a sensitivity of 92.3 % and a specificity of 100 %. To reflect a palliative intention only those patients with progressive disease were classified as non-responders. In this stetting TTP was also significantly (P < 0.01) different between responders and non-responders. In contrast, Peak and Rise rate did not show any significant difference between responder and non-responder. CONCLUSION: CEUS might serve as a surrogate marker to predict treatment response in patients with metastasized colorectal cancer who receive antiangiogenic therapy.
