Germline mutations in the base excision repair gene MUTYH have been associated with recessive inheritance of multiple colorectal adenomas. Screening of the MUTYH gene was carried on index cases of 10 unrelated Tunisian families and on available DNA samples from some members. Three germline mutations: c.536A > G (p.Y179C), c.1187 G > A (p.G396D) and c.1227_1228dup (p.Glu410GlyfsX43), were identified in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state in 8 out of 10 families. The c.1227_1228dup (p.Glu410GlyfsX43) mutation was the most frequent, since it was found in biallelic homozygous in 7 probands and 2 members of family F1 and in compound heterozygous associated with the c.536 A > G (p.Y179C) or c.1187 G > A (p.G396D) in family F2. Haplotype analysis revealed that the 8 families are unrelated. Moreover, in sporadic colorectal cancer, the c.1227_1228dup (p.Glu410GlyfsX43) mutation was identified in 13 % of patients compared to the p.G396D and p.Y179C found in 1.2 and 2.12 % respectively. Our data shows the high prevalence of the p.Glu410GlyfsX43 mutation in Tunisian families affected with MUTYH associated polyposis as well as in sporadic colorectal carcinoma.
