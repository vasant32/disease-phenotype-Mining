 BACKGROUND: TROP-2 is a tumor-promoting molecule that has been found to be overexpressed in many cancer cells, making it a plausible biomarker of carcinogenesis. The main aim of this study was to examine the effect of green tea catechins (namely, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate; EGCG) on TROP-2 expression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Western blot and RT-PCR were applied to assess TROP2 expression in colorectal cancer cells and tissues. RESULTS: Two different mechanisms were found to operate in diverse cell lines. In SW480 cells, EGCG affected the post-transcriptional processing of the TROP-2 mRNA, as this was quickly and specifically degraded in the presence of EGCG. In HCT-116 cells, EGCG affected TROP-2 expression at the post-translational level. TROP-2 was found to be highly expressed in colorectal tumors compared to adjacent normal tissues. CONCLUSION: This study provided a novel beneficial activity of green tea as an anti-tumorigenagent causing the suppression of TROP-2 in colorectal cancer.
