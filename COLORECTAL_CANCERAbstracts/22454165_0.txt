Treatment of cancer has evolved from surgical intervention towards multidisciplinary team(MDT) approach. The effect of MDT treatment modality on cancer is significantly better than that of conventional treatment modality. Obvious achievements have been made in breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and gastric cancer using the MDT model. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor(GIST) is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract. With the success  in GIST, molecular targeted therapy has become more and more specialized and individualized to manage this tumor. MDT modality is especially important in the diagnosis and treatment of GIST.
