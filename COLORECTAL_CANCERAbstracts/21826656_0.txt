Although the two isoforms of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) protein, STAT5a and STAT5b, have 94% sequence identity, they are encoded by different genes. Previous studies have been unable to define clearly the roles of the STAT5 genes in colorectal cancer (CRC). To investigate the role of STAT5 isoforms in CRC oncogenesis, immunohistochemical staining was performed. Colorectal adenocarcinomas showed higher expression of STAT5a/5b than normal colonic mucosa (P < 0.05), and STAT5b expression was significantly higher than that of STAT5a in colorectal adenocarcinoma tissue (P < 0.05). Furthermore, STAT5b expression was significantly associated with TNM stage. To delineate the roles of STAT5a/5b in CRC carcinogenesis, we studied CRC cells depleted of each isoform by treating the cells with small interfering RNA. Both STAT5a and STAT5b were found to be involved in cell growth, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis of CRC cells, and exerted their effects via the regulation of downstream targets of the STAT genes. However, STAT5b influenced CRC cell apoptosis more than STAT5a (P < 0.05), reducing mitochondrial membrane potential and generating reactive oxygen species. In conclusion, both isoforms of STAT5 are involved in the growth and cell cycle progression of CRC cells, STAT5b could play a more important role than STAT5a in the clinicopathological characteristics of CRC and CRC cell apoptosis.
