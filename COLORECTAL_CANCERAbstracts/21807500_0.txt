Cell cycle checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2) gene has been inconsistently associated with colorectal cancer (CRC), particularly the 1100delC variant. To generate large-scale evidence on whether the CHEK2 1100delC variant is associated with CRC susceptibility we have conducted a meta-analysis. Data were collected from the following electronic databases: PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, with the last report up to November 2010. The odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used to assess the strength of association. We evaluated the contrast of carriers versus non-carriers. Meta-analysis was performed in a fixed/random effect model by using the software Review Manager 4.2. A total of six studies including 4194 cases and 10,010 controls based on the search criteria were involved in this meta-analysis. A significant association of the CHEK2 1100delC variant with unselected CRC was found (OR=2.11, 95% CI=1.41-3.16, P=0.0003). We also found an association of the CHEK2 1100delC variant with familial CRC (OR=2.80, 95% CI=1.74-4.51, P<0.0001). However, the association was not established for sporadic CRC (OR=1.45, 95% CI=0.49-4.30, P=0.50). This meta-analysis demonstrates that the CHEK2 1100delC variant may be an important CRC-predisposing gene, which increases CRC risk.
