 BACKGROUND: The erythropoietin-analogue darbepoetin-α (DPO) improves liver function and regeneration after hepatectomy (Phx), however, also enhances Phx-induced tumor cell engraftment and neovascularization. Because it is unknown whether DPO also enhances the growth of established tumors, we herein studied the effect of DPO on established colorectal liver metastases after Phx. METHODS: CT26.WT cells were implanted into the liver of BALB/c mice. Five days after tumor establishment, animals underwent 50% Phx and received 10 μg/kgBW DPO or saline. Non-Phx animals with DPO or saline-treatment served as controls. Seven days after Phx tumors were analyzed regarding blood vessel formation, leukocyte adhesion, cell proliferation, apoptotic cell death, and growth using intravital fluorescence microscopy, histology, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The growth of established colorectal liver metastases was slightly stimulated after DPO-treatment in hepatectomized and non-hepatectomized animals. However, tumor vessel formation and tumor cell proliferation were significantly enhanced after DPO-treatment in hepatectomized and non-hepatectomized mice compared with controls. Apoptotic cell death and leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction were significantly reduced after DPO-treatment. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that DPO-treatment promotes neovascularization and cell proliferation in established colorectal liver metastases of hepatectomized and non-hepatectomized mice. DPO-application in patients with colorectal liver metastases might promote tumor progression and should therefore be avoided.
