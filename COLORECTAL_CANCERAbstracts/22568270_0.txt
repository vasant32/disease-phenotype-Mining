 UNLABELLED: Endoscopic removal of colon polyps is the main tool in colorectal cancer prevention programs. Although several quality indicators and guidelines have been proposed, polypectomy practices are still subject to great variation among endoscopist and little data is available regarding polypectomy practices in real life settings. METHODS: The records of the 1061 screening colonoscopies performed in 2010 in a tertiary care teaching hospital in Bucharest were reviewed and all colonoscopies where at least one polyp was detected were selected for analysis. The number of detected polyps, the resection rate and method used for polypectomy were studied and compared to colonoscopy quality indicators previously reported in literature. RESULTS: 941 polyps were detected in 395 patients. Invasive colorectal cancer was found in 42 patients. 548 polyps (58.23%) were removed endoscopically, with at least one polyp being resected in 283 patients (71.5%), resulting in a polypectomy rate of 26.67% in the entire study population. Cold forceps resection was the most commonly used method for the resection of polyps less than 5 mm in size, while for larger polyps hot snare was the preferred method. Concomitant invasive carcinoma and a larger number of polyps were predictive of incomplete removal of all detected polyps. CONCLUSION: Most quality indicators were met in our study group, with suboptimal performance regarding histological documentation of detected polyps and establishing a polyp-free colon.
