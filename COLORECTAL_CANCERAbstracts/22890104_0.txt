 OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop and validate the simplified Chinese version of the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire for Colorectal Cancer, QLQ-CR38. METHODS: It was developed by the strict translation procedure of EORTC translation guidelines, including translation, back translation, a pilot test and a cultural adaptation. Three instruments (QLQ-CR38, Quality of Life Instruments for Cancer Patients-Colorectal Cancer, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal) were used on a sample of 110 patients with colorectal cancer at the time of their admission to the hospital and 1-2 days after hospitalization, and a subsample of patients was measured a third time at discharge. The psychometric properties were evaluated by correlational analysis, multi-trait scaling analysis, factor analysis, and t tests. RESULTS: Multi-trait scaling analysis and correlation analysis among domains and items of the three instruments showed good construct validity and criterion-related validity. Cronbach's Î± and the test-retest reliability coefficients were greater than 0.70 for all domains (except chemotherapy side effects, 0.44 and 0.60, respectively). All domains had statistically significant changes after treatment with the standardized response mean ranging from 0.44 to 2.47. CONCLUSIONS: The simplified Chinese version of QLQ-CR38 has good validity, reliability, and responsiveness and can be used to measure the quality of life of Chinese patients with colorectal cancer.
