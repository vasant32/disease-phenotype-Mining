 BACKGROUND: High iron levels can increase the formation of noxious oxygen radicals, which are thought to promote carcinogenesis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this prospective study was to determine whether iron biomarkers and HFE genotypes, which influence iron regulation, constitute risk factors for colorectal cancer. DESIGN: This is a prospective nested case-referent study. SETTINGS: The study was performed within the population-based Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study. PATIENTS: The study included 226 cases of colorectal cancer and 437 matched referents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Conditional regression analysis was performed. Adjustments for smoking, smoking and BMI, and HFE C282Y and H63D were performed. RESULTS: The highest quintile of total iron-binding capacity showed significantly higher risk for colorectal cancer, unadjusted OR 2.35 (95% CI 1.38-4.02). When stratified by sex, the findings were only present in women (OR 3.34 (95% CI 1.59-7.02)). Ferritin was associated with reduced risk throughout quintiles 2 to 5 both in univariate and multivariate models. LIMITATIONS: Colorectal cancer may influence iron markers because of occult bleeding. Homozygotes for HFE C282Y were too few to make conclusions for this group. The relatively short follow-up time might be insufficient to detect risk of iron biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: High iron levels do not increase the risk of colorectal cancer. HFE genotypes influencing iron uptake had no effect on colorectal cancer risk.
