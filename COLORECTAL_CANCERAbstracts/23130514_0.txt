Circadian rhythm of 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) excretion has been studied in stomach cancer (n = 89) and colorectal cancer (n = 86) patients. The excretion of aMT6s was decreased in cancer patients. The disturbances of the circadian rhythm of aMT6s excretion have been observed in the cancer patients as well. These changes were directly proportional to the extent of cancer process and to the extent of lymphogenic metastasis.
