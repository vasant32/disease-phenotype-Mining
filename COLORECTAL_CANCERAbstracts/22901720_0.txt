 BACKGROUND: Treatments for the purposes of curing or more effectively managing metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) are evolving. Our study focused on patients with primary CRC with synchronous distant metastasis, and we analyzed the factors influencing patient survival. METHODS: Data review was conducted retrospectively. Clinicopathological parameters included age, sex, site of primary cancer, tumor cell differentiation, number of liver metastasis, presence of extrahepatic metastasis, treatment of liver metastasis, pre-treatment carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, status of treatment response, salvage treatment and survival. RESULTS: A total of 420 patients were identified and considered for our study. Of those, 275 patients (65.4%) had liver-only metastasis, 100 patients (23.8%) had concomitant lung metastasis, and 40 patients (9.5%) had other metastases. Additionally, 145 patients (34.5%) had liver-directed treatment including surgical resection (28.5%), radiofrequency ablation (RFA) (10.6%) and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TAE) (1.2%). There were 80 patients (19%) with CEA levels < 10, 135 patients (32.1%) with CEA 10-100, and 165 patients (39.2%) with CEA > 100. There were 200 patients (47.6%) who had received chemotherapy, 130 patients (30.9%) with target therapy, and 40 patients (9.5%) who had not undergone any salvage treatment. Three significant factors were identified, including treatment of liver metastasis (p=0.027), pre-treatment CEA (p=0.04), and salvage treatment (p=0.005). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated three factors influencing patient survival including treatment of liver metastasis, pre-treatment CEA level, and salvage treatment. Aggressive treatment of liver metastasis including surgical resection or RFA combined with chemotherapeutic agents appear to provide an increased rate of survival to patients.
