There was no literature reporting the relationship between AKAP13 and colorectal carcinoma. This study is aim to investigate the expression and role of AKAP13 in human colorectal cancers. This study investigated 94 pair-matched human colorectal cancers and adjacent normal mucosa, as well as 36 adenomas, of which mRNA expression of AKAP13 was detected by relative Quantitative-Real-Time RT-PCR and protein expression by immunohistochemical staining. AKAP13 gene was upregulated in colorectal cancer group by 2.259 times compared to control group without significant difference (P = 0.081), and no expression was detected in adenoma by RT-PCR. The positive expression rate of AKAP13 protein in colorectal carcinoma (52.3%) was significantly higher than those in adenoma (9.1%) and normal tissue (34.7%) (P = 0.006) by immunohistochemical staining. Either the mRNA or protein expressions of AKAP13 were correlated with histological types and differentiation grade (P < 0.05). Our results suggest AKAP13 protein may be related to the carcinogenesis of human colorectal cancer. However, more deeply and larger scale research are required to prove the correlation.
