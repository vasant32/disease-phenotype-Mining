A 62-year-old man with alcoholic liver cirrhosis underwent liver transplantation. The transplantation went uneventful and the ultrasound imaging of the liver performed after transplantation did not show any abnormalities. Eighteen months later, an intra-hepatic focal lesion was found on ultrasound. A contrast-enhanced ultrasound revealed a lesion with a malignant pattern of contrast uptake. The histo-pathological and subsequent molecular-pathological analysis concluded a colorectal metastasis of donor origin. The donor had no history of malignancy but no complete autopsy had been performed which illustrates the importance of the meticulous donors` screening. Transplanted patients carry a high risk of developing malignancy in general but donor related-tumors are very rare. The therapeutic considerations differ substantially between recipient- and donor-related malignancies. Therefore, considering the possibility of donor-related tumor by raising suspicion of malignant lesion with appropriate imaging and distinction from recipient-related malignancy by molecular analysis are crucial for proper therapeutic decision.
