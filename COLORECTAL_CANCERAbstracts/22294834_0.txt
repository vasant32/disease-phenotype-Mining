Endoscopic submucosal dissection is a challenging technique that enables en-bloc resection for large colorectal tumors, as laterally spreading tumors, particularly difficult, if the ileocecal valve and terminal ileum is involved. Herein, we report on one of 4 cases. The procedures, using a bipolar needle knife (B-Knife) to reduce the perforation risk and carbon dioxide instead of conventional air insufflation for patient comfort, achieved curative resections without any complications.
