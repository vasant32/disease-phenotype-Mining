Pyruvate kinase type M2 (PKM2) has been reported to be involved in aerobic glycolysis and cell growth in various tumors. However, the expression pattern of PKM2 in colorectal cancer (CRC) and the correlation between PKM2 expression and CRC remains unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate PKM2 expression and its possible role in CRC. We found that expression of PKM2 was increased in CRC and the increased PKM2 expression was associated with later stage and lymph metastasis of the tumors. Knockdown of PKM2 suppressed the aerobic glycolysis and decreased lactate production of colon cancer RKO cells. Knockdown of PKM2 repressed proliferation and migration of the cells. Inhibition of PKM2 suppressed xenograft tumor growth of RKO cells in vivo. These results suggest that the expression of PKM2 plays a critical role in development of CRC, and it may provide a growth advantage for colon cancer cells. Thus, PKM2 might be a potential therapeutic target for CRC.
