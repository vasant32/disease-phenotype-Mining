OBJECTIVE: To determine hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway correlated with the development of colon cancer and melanosis coli. METHODS: Protein and mRNA levels of Hh signaling pathway components (SHH, PTCH1, Gli1 and SUFU) in 127 patients with colon cancer, 36 with melanosis coli and 20 adjacent normal mucosal tissues taken from surgical specimens were evaluated using antibody staining and qRT-PCR. RESULTS: In the normal tissues, SHH and PTCH, but not Gli1 or SUFU, were weakly expressed and mainly in the epithelial lining of the colonic mucosa. In cancerous tissues, SHH and Gli1 was uniformly strong while that of PTCH1 was patchy and weak, and SUFU uniformly weak, which paralleled the levels of corresponding mRNA. Elevated protein levels of SHH and PTCH were significantly associated with mucinous CRC tissues. Elevated SUFU protein levels were positively correlated with tumor diameter and invasion. In those with melanosis coli, mRNA levels of SHH, PTCH1, Gli1 and SUFU were very low, which were similar to those of normal tissues; but protein levels of SHH, PTCH1 and Gli1, but not SUFU, were high, which were similar to those of cancerous tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Hh pathway component mRNA and protein levels are aberrantly elevated in colon cancer, which may be potentially useful as molecular classification markers. Further studies are required to determine the role of melanosis coli in the tumorigenesis of colon cancer.
