 OBJECTIVE: To investigate effect of the treatments and prognostic factors of patients with pulmonary metastasis from colorectal cancer. METHODS: Clinical data of 79 patients who suffered from lung metastatic diseases from colorectal cancer in 1990 - 2010 were retrospectively analyzed. The number of patients who had received lung operation was 22, and non-operated group contained 57 patients. Compared the prognosis of operated group and non-operated group and analyzed the prognostic factors. RESULTS: The median survival time after the pulmonary resections was 34.5 months; the overall survival of 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 90.9%, 45.4% and 4.5%, and the overall of 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rate in non-operated group were 59.6%, 14.0% and 0. The surgery (RR = 4.805, 95% CI: 1.864 - 12.384, P = 0.001) and the number of metastasis (RR = 2.177, 95% CI: 1.431 - 3.314, P = 0.010) were the factors that could influence the patients prognosis. CONCLUSION: The surgery for pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer is effective.
