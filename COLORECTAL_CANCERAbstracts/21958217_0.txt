 OBJECTIVE: To analyze the impact of the length of disease-free intervals on incidence estimation. DATA SOURCE: Statutory health insurance sample in Germany. STUDY DESIGN: Overestimation of the incidence in the first quarter of 2008 for three selected diseases, diabetes mellitus, colorectal cancer, and heart failure, depending on different lengths of preceding disease-free intervals. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Continuously insured from 2000 until 2008 â‰¥ 18 years (N = 144,907). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Compared with an 8-year disease-free period, incidence overestimations for diabetes, colorectal cancer, and heart failure were 40, 23, and 43 percent defining a 1-year, and 5, 9, and 5 percent defining a 5-year disease-free period, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the specific disease, caution has to be taken while using short disease-free periods because incidence estimates may be extremely overestimated.
