Constitutively activated STAT3 and STAT5 are expressed in a wide variety of human malignancies including solid and hematopoietic cancers and often correlate with a poor prognosis and resistance to multiple therapies. Given the well established role of STAT3 in tumorigenesis, inhibition of Janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2) activity might represent an attractive therapeutic approach. Using a mouse model of colitis-induced colorectal cancer, we show that a novel, orally active, selective JAK2 inhibitor, CEP-33779, induced regression of established colorectal tumors, reduced angiogenesis, and reduced proliferation of tumor cells. Histopathologic analysis confirmed reduced incidence of histologic-grade neoplasia by CEP-33779. Tumor regression correlated with inhibition of STAT3 and NF-κB (RelA/p65) activation in a CEP-33779 dose-dependent manner. In addition, the expression of proinflammatory, tumor-promoting cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β was strongly reduced upon JAK2 inhibition. The ability of CEP-33779 to suppress growth of colorectal tumors by inhibiting the IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling suggests a potential therapeutic utility of JAK2 inhibitors in multiple tumors types, particularly those with a strong inflammatory component.
