Although endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for colorectal neoplasm is a promising endoscopic therapy with a high rate of successful en bloc resection, ESD for colorectal neoplasm is not a health-care service provided by Japanese public heath insurance, yet. Now, ESD for colorectal neoplasm has been approved as an 'advanced medical treatment' system, which is a partial-care service provided by Japanese public health insurance with individual payment of medical expenses, and the indication for ESD for colorectal neoplasm has been under debate. In our hospital, a total of 348 colorectal neoplasms underwent ESD using the FlexKnife and the FlushKnife, and 317 lesions (91%) were resected en bloc. Perforation occurred in eight cases (2%) and they were not critical and did not require emergent surgery. Delayed bleeding occurred in 16 cases (4%) and they were able to be controlled without transfusion and were not critical. The major impact of the advanced medical treatment system on clinical practice in our hospital was the increased incidence of adenocarcinoma and increased tumor size in the lesions that underwent ESD. It is thought that the application of the advanced medical treatment system resulted in careful selection of lesions for ESD while maintaining the principle of en bloc resection. We expect that a new, revised indication that covers recurrent carcinoma after endoscopic therapy will be indicated when ESD for colorectal neoplasm becomes a health-care service provided by Japanese public health insurance.
