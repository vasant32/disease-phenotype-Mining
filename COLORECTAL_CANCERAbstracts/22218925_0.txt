Recent evidence suggests that HER2 (ErbB2; Her-2/neu) and the related PI3K/Akt signaling pathway substantially affect the malignant phenotype of colorectal cancer cells. Moreover, fatty acid synthase (FASN), which mediates de-novo fatty acid synthesis, is crucially important in the carcinogenesis process of a variety of cancers, including colorectal cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate the malignant phenotype regulation of colorectal cancer cells via the "HER2-PI3K/Akt-FASN axis". Caco-2 cells with high expression of HER2 and FASN and high transfection efficiency were selected for functional characterization. The cells were transfected with either HER2-specific RNAi plasmid or negative control RNAi plasmid, followed by Q-RT-PCR and western blot assays to examine expression of HER2, PI3K, Akt, and FASN. MTT and colony-formation assays were used to assess proliferation. Migration was investigated by use of the transwell assay, and apoptosis and cell cycle were assayed by use of flow cytometry. Expression of HER2, PI3K, Akt, and FASN were downregulated when HER2 was silenced. Proliferation decreased after downregulation of HER2, which was consistent with increased apoptosis. Migration of HER2-silenced cells was also impaired. Loss of HER2 inhibits the activity of the "HER2-PI3K/Akt-FASN axis" of Caco-2 cells, and reduced activity of this axis alters the malignant behavior of Caco-2 cells.
