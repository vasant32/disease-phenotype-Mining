In the last 15 years, significant progress in the management of colorectal cancer (CRC) has been achieved with several new agents licensed extending median overall survival for stage IV disease to about 2 years. Treatment of CRC is stage-specific, multidisciplinary, and based on patient and tumor characteristics. Although especially early stages (0-III, according to Union for International Cancer Control) are treated with curative intent, patients with limited stage IV disease (liver and/or lung or localized peritoneal metastases) might still be curable in a multimodality approach including surgery, perioperative chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Despite the broad variety of prognostic factors, treatment decisions and selection of drugs are mainly based on clinicopathologic variables for early stage CRC, extent of disease, potential resectability, patients' eligibility to receive aggressive treatments including chemotherapy, surgery, and very few molecular markers such as KRAS mutational status for advanced disease. However, a tailored approach for the treatment of CRC taking into account all mentioned factors is currently recommended by national and international guidelines and will be discussed in this review.
