Advances in surgical and medical treatments have significantly changed the management of colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRCLMs). In particular, new drugs and modern combination chemotherapy regimens, together with the improvement of surgical techniques, allow a potentially curative approach in an increasing number of patients. Nevertheless, there is no strong evidence for an optimal treatment strategy for CRCLMs, mainly because of the extensive heterogeneity in the patients. In fact, although we consider them a population, they represent different clinical and biological subtypes requiring different approaches. Furthermore, results from different studies in this setting may be difficult to interpret, also because the definitions of different patient subgroups are unclear and overlapping. In this review we discuss the results of clinical trials evaluating the role of chemotherapy in the multimodal management of CRCLMs, in either the pre- or postoperative setting. Then we identify three main categories of CRCLM patients, providing clinical recommendations for each.
