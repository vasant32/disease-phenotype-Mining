 AIM: The study assessed the role of colorectal surgery in the treatment of metastatic melanoma and identified patients who can most benefit from surgical resection. METHOD: A retrospective analysis was made of 34 consecutive patients with skin melanoma who underwent surgical resection of large bowel metastasis. RESULTS: The median disease-free interval between diagnosis of the primary and metastatic melanoma was 24 (7-98) months. Nine (27%) patients underwent emergency surgery for obstruction and 25 (73%) had an elective procedure. Resection with curative intent was performed in 14 (41%) and palliative resection in 20 (59%) patients. There was no postoperative mortality and morbidity occurred in 9%. The median survival following surgery was 11.5 (4-68) months. The 1-, 2- and 5-year survival rates were 50%, 32% and 17% respectively. Median survival was significantly increased in patients without extra-abdominal metastases, with no evidence of non-large-bowel metastases, if the disease-free interval was longer than 24 months and when curative resection was performed. In multivariate analysis, an apparently complete or palliative resection and the absence or presence of extra-abdominal metastases were the most important prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: An aggressive surgical approach to large bowel metastatic melanoma results in good palliation and effective relief of symptoms with acceptable morbidity and mortality.
