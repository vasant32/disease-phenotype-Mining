 AIM: Platinum agents have shown to be effective in the treatment of colorectal cancer. We assessed whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GSTP1, ERCC1 Asn118Asn and ERCC2 Lys751Gln might predict the overall survival in patients receiving oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in a Chinese population. METHODS: SNPs of GSTP1, ERCC1 Asn118Asn and ERCC2 Lys751Gln in 335 colorectal cancer patients were assessed using TaqMan nuclease assays. RESULTS: At the time of final analysis on Nov. 2011, the median follow-up period was 37.7 months (range from 1 to 60 months). A total of 229 patients died during follow-up. Our study showed GSTP1 Val/Val (HR=0.44, 95% CI=0.18-0.98), ERCC1 C/C (HR=0.20, 95% CI=0.10-0.79) and ERCC2 G/G (HR=0.48, 95% CI=0.19-0.97) to be significantly associated with better survival of colorectal cancer. GSTP1 Val/Val, ERCC1 C/C and ERCC2 G/G were also related to longer survival among patients with colon cancer, with HRs (95% CIs) of 0.41 (0.16-0.91), 0.16 (0.09-0.74) and 0.34 (0.16-0.91), respectively. CONCLUSION: GSTP1, GSTP1, ERCC1 Asn118Asn and ERCC2 Lys751Gln genotyping might facilitate tailored oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy for colorectal cancer patients.
