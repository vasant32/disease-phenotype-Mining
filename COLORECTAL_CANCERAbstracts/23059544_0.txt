Therapeutic effects of hybrid liposomes (HL) composed of l-Î±-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and polyoxyethylene(25) dodecyl ether (C(12)(EO)(25)) on the metastasis of human colon carcinoma (HCT116) cells were examined in vivo. Remarkably high therapeutic effects were obtained in the xenograft mouse models of colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastases after treatment with HL-25 on the basis of relative liver weight and histological analysis of the liver tissue sections of mouse models with HE staining, and TUNEL staining for detection of apoptotic cells. The survival effects of HL-25 were obtained using xenograft mouse models of CRC liver metastases. Furthermore, with regard to pharmacokinetics, the accumulation of fluorescent labeled HL-25 was observed in the liver tissue of xenograft mouse models of CRC liver metastases for 24 h after the intravenous injection of fluorescent labeled HL-25. Therapeutic effects of HL without any drugs on the liver metastasis of human CRC were revealed for the first time in vivo.
