 OBJECTIVES: To determine the optimum strategy for increasing up-to-date (UTD) levels in older Americans, while reducing disparities between White, Black, and Hispanic adults, aged 65 years and older. METHODS: Data were analyzed from the 2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, quantifying the proportion of older Americans UTD with influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations, mammograms, Papanicolaou tests, and colorectal cancer screening. A comparison of projected changes in UTD levels and disparities was ascertained by numerically accounting for UTD adults lacking 1 or more clinical preventive services (CPS). Analyses were performed by gender and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Expanded provision of specific vaccinations and screenings each increased UTD levels. When those needing only vaccinations were immunized, there was a projected decrease in racial/ethnic disparities in UTD levels (2.3%-12.2%). When those needing only colorectal cancer screening, mammography, or Papanicolaou test were screened, there was an increase in UTD disparities (1.6%-4.5%). CONCLUSIONS: A primary care and public health focus on adult immunizations, in addition to other CPS, offers an effective strategy to reduce disparities while improving UTD levels.
