Small intestinal lymphoma is a common feline tumour that most often develops in older cats, but also occurs in younger animals. In man, germline defects in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes most commonly cause hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), or Lynch syndrome, while MMR defects have also been implicated in the development of lymphoid tumours in mice and in people. It was hypothesized that inherited MMR defects predispose a proportion of younger cats to the development of small intestinal lymphoma. MMR expression in 10 small intestinal lymphomas from younger cats (group 1, mean age 4.5 years) was compared with MMR expression in 30 small intestinal lymphomas from older cats (group 2, mean age 12.6 years). The cross-reactivity of the antibodies specific for the human MMR proteins MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 with the corresponding proteins in feline tissues was first confirmed by western blotting. MMR expression was then investigated immunohistochemically in feline lymphomas. MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 were detected immunohistochemically within neoplastic lymphocytes from all tumours examined. There were no significant differences between the two groups in either the intensity of immunolabelling or the percentage of neoplastic cells within which MMR proteins were detected. These results confirm the cross-reactivity of the human MMR antibodies with the corresponding proteins in feline tissues, but do not support the hypothesis that inherited germline MMR defects are a significant cause of feline small intestinal lymphomas.
