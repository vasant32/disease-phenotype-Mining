Recently, we reported the accumulation of CD4(+)FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) within the tumor mass of patients bearing liver cancer. Tumor-infiltrating Tregs (TiTregs) are active and potent suppressors of antitumor immunity. Importantly, treatment with GITRL reduced theÂ immunosuppression mediated by TiTregs.
