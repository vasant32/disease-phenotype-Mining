The death receptor CD95 promotes apoptosis through well-defined signalling pathways. In colorectal cancer cells, CD95 primarily stimulates migration and invasion through pathways that are incompletely understood. Here, we identify a new CD95-activated tyrosine kinase pathway that is essential for CD95-stimulated tumour cell invasion. We show that CD95 promotes Tyr 783 phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ1 through the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β, resulting in ligand-stimulated phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) hydrolysis. PIP(2) hydrolysis liberates the actin-severing protein cofilin from the plasma membrane to initiate cortical actin remodelling. Cofilin activation is required for CD95-stimulated formation of membrane protrusions and increased tumour cell invasion.
