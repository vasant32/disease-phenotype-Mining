 BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Faecal occult blood test (FOBt) is commonly requested by clinicians in both primary and secondary care. The aim of this study was to examine the use and outcomes of clinician-requested FOB testing in a single Trust taking part in the National Bowel Cancer Screening Programme pilots. METHODS: Data from a single Trust was used. The Trust's pathology reporting system was searched retrospectively for all FOBt study requests in 1 year. In patients with a positive test, the Trust's clinical results reporting system was searched to determine the type and outcome of any investigations. Patients with positive tests were cross-matched with the Trust's colorectal cancer database to detect interval cancers. RESULTS: 1363 FOB tests were requested during the calendar year. 715 (52.5%) were completed. Mean age was 60.6 years, 30.7% of patients were in the screening age group. 60 (4.4%) patients were FOBt positive. Total colonic imaging was performed in only 22% of those who were FOBt positive. Significant pathology was detected in five patients (0.4%) including three colonic carcinomas. There were no interval cancers in the FOBt-positive group. CONCLUSIONS: The number of FOBt requests has increased with the introduction of a colorectal cancer screening programme. The FOBt completion rate and colonic imaging rate in FOBt-positive patients outside the national screening programme was low. Guidelines for the use of FOBt outside of screening are needed.
