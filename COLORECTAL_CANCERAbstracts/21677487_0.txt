We retrospectively investigated the incidence of infusion reactions following cetuximab chemotherapy in 93 patients with colorectal cancer. Patients received chemotherapy treatment from September 2008 to February 2010 at Aichi Cancer Center Hospital. The initial cetuximab dose was 400 mg/m(2), followed weekly by an additional 250 mg/m(2), and biweekly by 500 mg/m(2). Infusion reactions were observed in 12 patients (13%), with grade 1 reactions in 6 patients and grade 2 reactions in 6 patients. Eleven of the 12 patients (92%) experienced infusion reactions during the first treatment. Typical grade 1 adverse events were fever and chills, nausea, vomiting and pruritus. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were given for fever and chills. Grade 2 adverse events included dyspnea and wheezing, eruption, facial flushing and convulsions. Steroids were given for these symptoms. Infusion reactions were observed in 3 of the 12 patients (25%) <15 min after intravenous injection, 16-60 min after injection in 3 more patients (25%), and 61-120 min after injection in the remaining 6 patients (50%).
