 PURPOSE: Although small rectal carcinoid tumors can be treated using local excision, complete resection can be difficult because tumors are located in the submucosal layer. We evaluate the factors associated with pathologically complete local resection of rectal carcinoid tumors. METHODS: Data were analyzed of 161 patients with 166 rectal carcinoid tumors who underwent local excision with curative intent from January 2001 to December 2010. A pathologically complete resection (P-CR) was defined as an en bloc resection with tumor-free lateral and deep margins. The study classified treatments into three categories for analysis: conventional polypectomy (including strip biopsy, snare polypectomy, and hot biopsy), advanced endoscopic techniques (including endoscopic mucosal resection with cap and endoscopic submucosal dissection), and surgical local excision (including transanal excision and transanal endoscopic microsurgery). We evaluated the P-CR rate according to treatment method, tumor size, initial endoscopic impression and the use of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). RESULTS: The mean tumor size was 5.51 ± 2.43 mm (range 2-18 mm) and all lesions were confined to the submucosal layer. The P-CR rates were 30.9, 72.0, and 81.8 % for conventional polypectomy, advanced endoscopic techniques, and surgical local excision, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that P-CR was associated with treatment method, use of EUS or TRUS, and initial endoscopic impression. Multivariate analysis showed that only treatment method was associated with P-CR. CONCLUSION: Pathologically complete resection of small rectal carcinoid tumors was more likely to be achieved when using advanced endoscopic techniques or surgical local excision rather than conventional polypectomy.
