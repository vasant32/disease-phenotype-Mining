Colorectal cancer was one of the first solid tumors to be classified on the basis of molecular profiling. Microsatellite instability has allowed researchers to distinguish a specific subtype of colorectal cancer that has a clearly identified molecular origin (mismatch repair deficiency), arises on a hereditary and sporadic basis, is linked to a clear clinicopathologic profile, and has prognostic implications. Inconclusive predictive data along with a paucity of targeted drug development have prevented this molecular classification system from being implemented in the clinical setting. New high-throughput genomic data have validated it, thus stressing the fact that it is ready to be applied clinically.
