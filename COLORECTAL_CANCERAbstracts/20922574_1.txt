 BACKGROUND: Resection + radiofrequency ablation (RFA) + hepatic artery infusion (HAI) + systemic chemotherapy for patients with unresectable synchronous liver-only metastases from colorectal cancer was rarely used previously. METHODS: We compared the outcomes of 42 patients underwent resection + RFA + HAI + systemic chemotherapy (RRHS) with that of 43 patients underwent resection + RFA + systemic chemotherapy (RRS). RESULTS: The overall survival, the survival free of hepatic recurrence and the median survival in the RRHS group were all significantly higher than those in RRS group at 4 years. While the rates of adverse effects were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSION: For patients with unresectable synchronous liver-only metastases from colorectal cancer, RRHS not only decreases but also postpones hepatic recurrence and therefore improves overall survival at 4 years, as compared with RRS.
