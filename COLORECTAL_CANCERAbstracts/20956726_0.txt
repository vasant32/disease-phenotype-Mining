The International Colorectal Cancer Screening Network (ICRCSN) is a global consortium of initiatives delivering organized colorectal cancer (CRC) screening to their populations. The aim of the Network is to promote improvements in quality assurance (QA) and programme evaluation to maximize the benefit and to minimize the risk associated with CRC screening. ICRCSN currently includes 41 member initiatives from 27 countries. The ICRCSN held its second international meeting in Oxford in September 2008 with representatives from 24 countries. This report summarizes the presentations and discussions, the feedback from participants on their current and future needs and the potential role of the ICRCSN in supporting those needs.
