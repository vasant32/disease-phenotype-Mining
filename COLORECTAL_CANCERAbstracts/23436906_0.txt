Cellular functions are regulated and executed by complex protein interaction networks. Accordingly, it is essential to understand the interplay between proteins in determining the activity status of signaling cascades. New methods are therefore required to provide information on different protein interaction events at the single cell level in heterogeneous cell populations, such as in tissue sections. We describe herein a multiplex proximity ligation assay for simultaneous analysis of multiple protein complexes in situ. Using this assay, we determined the balance between alternative protein complexes by visualizing EGFR, HER2 and HER3 homo and heterodimers in breast cancer tissue sections. In addition, the altered pattern of Î²-catenin complex formation with either E-cadherin or TCF1 was analyzed in colorectal cancer tissue sections. The study of several concurrent signaling events at single cell resolution will form a basis for a systems understanding, crucial for disease diagnostics and in drug development.
