Colorectal cancer is the third most common malignant cancer worldwide and molecular mechanisms of cancer metastasis are poorly understood. Researches suggested that the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays a critical role in development and cancer. β-catenin acts as a component of the Wnt signaling in addition to being an integral component of adherens junctions. The traditional notion that β-catenin dysregulation caused by inactivating mutation of APC cannot completely elucidate the role of β-catenin in invasion and metastasis. Recently, the important roles of SATB1in T-cell development and differentiation and in promotion of breast tumor growth and metastasis were reported. The hypothesis we proposed is that SATB1 may be involved in the development and progression of colorectal cancer in a Wnt/β-catenin signaling-dependent manner.
