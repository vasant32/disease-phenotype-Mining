 OBJECTIVE: EndostarÂ® (Rh-endostatin injection) is a new recombinant human endostatin developed by Shandong Simcere-Medgenn Bio-Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd in China. This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Endostar plus leucovorin calcium/ 5-fluorouracil/oxaliplatin (FOLFOX4) in treating patients with advanced colorectal cancer. METHODS: Thirty-six patients with advanced colorectal cancer were retrospectively assigned to one of two treatment groups: FOLFOX4 (control) or FOLFOX4 plus Endostar (Endostar) according to patient accreditation. The observational end points were overall response rate, overall survival, progression-free survival and toxicity. RESULTS: The response rate and progression-free survival of Endostar were significantly better than those of control group (P <0.05), but significance was not observed for median survival. In addition, gastrointestinal side effects and incidence of leucopenia were not lower than in the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of Endostar to FOLFOX4 resulted in a higher objective response rate and longer time to disease progression. Hypertension and cardiac ischemia were the principal safety concerns, but were manageable. Endostar deserves to be further investigated by randomized controlled clinical trails.
