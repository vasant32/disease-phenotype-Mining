The prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) is assessed through conventional clinicopathological parameters, which are not always accurate. Members of the human kallikrein-related peptidases gene family represent potential cancer biomarkers. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of human tissue kallikrein-related peptidase 6 (KLK6) by immunohistochemistry in CRC to correlate this expression with various histopathological and clinical variables, and to evaluate its significance as a predictor of disease outcome. KLK6 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and an expression score was calculated for each case. In CRC, KLK6 expression was decreased compared to normal colonic mucosa. A statistically significant, positive association was observed between KLK6 and tumor stage (p=0.036), lymph node metastases (p=0.030), and liver metastases (p=0.025). Univariate analysis showed that KLK6 expression and stage had statistically significant correlation with disease-free survival (p=0.045 and p<0.001, respectively) and overall survival (p=0.027 and p<0.001, respectively). Cox multivariate analysis showed that KLK6 expression was an independent predictor of unfavorable overall survival (p=0.041). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that KLK6-positive patients have statistically significant lower disease-free and overall survival. In conclusion, KLK6 immunostaining is an independent prognostic marker in patients with CRC.
