The success of biliary drainage in patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer and obstructive jaundice influences its prognosis greatly. In this study, we report a retrospective evaluation of endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage in patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer and obstructive jaundice. Materials and methods: From April 2004 to December 2011, 9 patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer and obstructive jaundice who underwent endoscopic biliary drainage were evaluated retrospectively. Results: The mean serum levels of total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase improved significantly after biliary drainage. The median survival time after biliary drainage was 133 days. Only 4 cases were able to resume chemotherapy after biliary drainage, and their prognosis was significantly better than patients who were not able to resume chemotherapy(p=0.014). Discussion: Endoscopic biliary drainage in patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer and obstructive jaundice was effective, led to the resumption of chemotherapy, and improved prognosis. However, sufficient consideration of the patient's prognosis and performance status is required in order to perform biliary drainage.
