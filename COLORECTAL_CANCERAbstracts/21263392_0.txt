 AIM: To present preliminary results of the colorectal cancer early detection program, a part of the project called "A Model of Early Cancer Detection Integrated in a Practice of a Family Physician", carried out by the Department of Family Medicine of the Osijek University School of Medicine and the Health Centre of Osijek, Croatia. METHODS: The strategy of the project, based on the central role of a family physician in the implementation of the early cancer detection programs, was described and preliminary results of the colorectal cancer early detection program are presented and compared with the same issues of the National Program, centrally conducted and supplied by public services. RESULTS: From the beginning of April unil the end of May 2009, a total number of 516 testing cards on occult faecal blood were delivered to patients from two target groups (aged 45-50 and 75-79). A high responding rate of 69.76% (360) was recorded. This is an advantage in comparison with the low responding rates of about 20% (43 862), obtained by the National Program. In the project, there were in average 2.5% (9) positive tests, with the higher percent in the older than in the younger age group, 3.5% (12) and 1% (4) respectively). CONCLUSION: Data obtained by the Project, and by the National Program--indicate that there could be a need for a more precise definition of risk groups who have to be invited for screening.
