 PURPOSE: This study describes hyperpigmentation at the epidermis around a colostomy during and after systemic chemotherapy with S-1 (a compound of tegaful, gimestat, and potassium oxonate). SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Thirty-one colorectal cancer patients (male 17, female 14) visited the stoma-care clinic, akita university hospital between april 2003 and march 2006. fourteen patients (male 8, female 6) had been observed continuously for more than 3 months. METHODS: Results of 5 male patients who received systemic chemotherapy using S-1 were compared to those of 9 male and female patients who did not receive S-1. the shades of epidermal pigmentation at the peristomal area were graded on a 3-point likert scale, where grade 2 indicated very dark pigmentation, grade 1 indicated moderately dark pigmentation, and grade 0 indicated no pigmentation of the peristomal skin. RESULTS: Pigmentation scores in patients receiving S-1 were significantly higher than scores in patients who did not receive S-1 systemic chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid and excessive pigmentation of the peristomal skin may occur in patients receiving S-1 systemic chemotherapy because it indicates an adverse event related with systemic chemotherapy and leads to peristomal skin problems.
