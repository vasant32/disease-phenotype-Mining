Positron emission tomography (PET) with [(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) has proven to be a valuable diagnostic modality in various diseases. Its accuracy has been improved with the hybrid PET/computed tomography (CT) technique because of precise anatomic location of areas of abnormal FDG accumulation. This integrated PET/CT modality has been widely adopted, particularly in oncology. This paper reviews the role of FDG-PET/CT imaging in breast cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer as well as lymphoma on the basis of recent key articles. Special attention is paid to preoperative diagnostic workup, evaluation of treatment response and survival prognosis. Experience from specialized centers indicates that there is strong evidence for the clinical effectiveness of FDG-PET/CT in staging, restaging and the prediction of response to therapy in the above-mentioned malignancies. It is concluded that this imaging modality contributes considerably to improved patient management and paves the way to personalize cancer treatment in a cost-effective way.
