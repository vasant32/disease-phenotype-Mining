 UNLABELLED: Aim: Oxaliplatin with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (FOLFOX and FLOX) or capecitabine (XELOX) is the standard adjuvant treatment for colonic cancer. In metastatic disease, 5-FU/leucovorin/irinotecan (FOLFIRI) and FOLFOX are equivalent in respect to response rates, progression-free and overall survival. Little data are available to compare their efficacy after exposure to oxaliplatin-containing adjuvant chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We carried out a retrospective study of patients who underwent surgery and FOLFOX adjuvant chemotherapy, followed by FOLFIRI or FOLFOX for metastatic disease. Exclusion criteria were: metastatic disease at presentation and no oxaliplatin in adjuvant chemotherapy. The end-point was the overall response rate (ORR) to first-line chemotherapy for metastatic disease after three months, as assessed by computed tomography (CT). RESULTS: A total of 205 patients received FOLFOX as adjuvant treatment for colorectal adenocarcinoma between 2006 and 2010. Metastatic disease was diagnosed later in 32 cases after a median follow-up of three years (range=1-5.5 years). The median time between the beginning of adjuvant chemotherapy and onset of metastatic disease was 1.7 years (range=0.5-5.5 years). Twenty-eight patients were evaluable for effects of treatment: six patients received FOLFOX plus bevacizumab and 22 FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab. The ORR was 17% in the FOLFOX group versus 36% in the FOLFIRI group (p=0.22). This difference was not statistically significant, despite a trend in favor of FOLFIRI. CONCLUSION: Metastatic disease after exposure to oxaliplatin in the adjuvant setting tends to occur early and can be characterized by partial resistance to this agent. Despite insufficient statistical power, our results suggest that FOLFIRI may result in higher response rates than FOLFOX in this situation. However, oxaliplatin re-challenge can also lead to radiological responses and disease stabilization.
