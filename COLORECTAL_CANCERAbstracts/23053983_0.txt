The main regulator of anti-tumor immune response is the activity of monocytes, suggesting that the produced cytokines may have a prognostic role. This study investigates gene expression of interleukin (IL)-12-related cytokine and IL-10 in stimulated monocytes from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Relative quantification of IL-12A, IL-12B, IL-23A and IL-10 mRNA transcripts was performed on the third hours after stimulation by real-time qPCR. We also explored an inhibitor of JNK signaling pathway activation for the observed cytokine gene expression. A strong downregulation of IL-12B mRNA expression in CRC monocytes compared to healthy donors was observed. The rate of transcription of IL-12B in stimulated monocytes was associated with the stage of CRC. The expression of IL-12A gene in stimulated monocytes from patients with advanced was lower than early cancer. Moreover, we observed stage dependent JNK inhibition mediated reduction in IL-12A expression. The hyporesponsiveness was strongly expressed in monocytes from advanced then early stages of CRC. Expression of IL-10 mRNA was almost equally in CRC monocytes from early stages and healthy donors. We demonstrated that altered gene expression profiles of IL-12A, IL-12B, IL-23A at mRNA level in CRC monocytes was associated with tumor development and can be attributed to anticancer immune response.
