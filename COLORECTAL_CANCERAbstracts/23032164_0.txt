We recently conducted several studies regarding the presence of high-risk HPVs in human cervical, colorectal and breast cancers in the Syrian population. Herein, we report that high-risk HPVs type 16, 18, 33, 45, 51, 52 and 58 are frequently present in colorectal cancer in this population. Therefore and based on previous studies and present data, we conclude that the most frequent high-risk HPV types, in the Syrian population, are 16, 18, 33, 35, 45, 51, 52 and 58. Thus, our data suggest that it will be useful to use the new generation of HPV vaccine to protect the Syrian population from high-risk HPVs and their associated cancers.
