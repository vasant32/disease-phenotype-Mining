 BACKGROUND: Tumor infiltrating B cells (TiBc) have not yet been investigated in detail. This may at least in part be due to technical difficulties. Here we describe a straightforward and reproducible method to isolate and culture TiBc from primary colorectal carcinomas (CRC). METHODS/RESULTS: TiBc cultures were generated by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immortalization. With this method, monoclonal TiBc cultures were obtained for 14/19 CRCs. As assessed by flow cytometry and ELISA, TiBc showed an activated immunophenotype (CD23(+), CD80(+)) and produced immunoglobulin (Ig; IgG secretion in 55% of the cultures). In functional in vitro analysis, most of the IgGs specifically bound to allogeneic CRC target cells. These data suggest that TiBc are antigen-experienced and thus may exhibit functionality in situ. Additionally, mini-cultures generated from 12 further CRCs revealed TiBc outgrowth exclusively in the presence of EBV. CONCLUSION: In summary, this simple method provides a cellular tool and our data set the stage for analysing the bivalent role of TiBc; being antigen-presenting cells on the one hand and tumor-specific antibody producers on the other. Additionally, the generation of long-term TiBc cultures and their monoclonal Ig may serve to identify novel tumor-specific antigens.
