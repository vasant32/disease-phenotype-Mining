 BACKGROUND: A number of case-control studies were conducted to investigate the association of SULT1A1 R213H polymorphisms with colorectal cancer (CRC) in humans. But the results were not always consistent. We performed a meta-analysis to examine the association between the SULT1A1 R213H polymorphism and CRC. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data were collected from the following electronic databases: PubMed, Elsevier Science Direct, Excerpta Medica Database, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, with the last report up to September 2010. A total of 12 studies including 3,549 cases and 5,610 controls based on the search criteria were involved in this meta-analysis. Overall, no significant association of this polymorphism with CRC was found (H versus R: OR = 1.04, 95%CI = 0.94-1.16, P = 0.46; HR+HH versus RR: OR = 1.01, 95%CI = 0.92-1.11, P = 0.81; HH versus RR+HR: OR = 1.01, 95%CI = 0.74-1.38, P = 0.95; HH versus RR: OR = 1.00, 95%CI = 0.77-1.31, P = 0.98; HR versus RR: OR = 1.01, 95%CI = 0.92-1.11, P = 0.86). In subgroup analysis, we also did not find any significant association in Cauasians (H versus R: OR = 1.02, 95%CI = 0.92-1.15, P = 0.68; HR+HH versus RR: OR = 0.99, 95%CI = 0.91-1.09, P = 0.90; HH versus RR+HR: OR = 1.01, 95%CI = 0.73-1.39, P = 0.97; HH versus RR: OR = 0.99, 95%CI = 0.75-1.31, P = 0.94; HR versus RR: OR = 0.99, 95%CI = 0.90-1.09, P = 0.85). The results were not materially altered after the studies which did not fulfill Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were excluded (H versus R: OR = 1.06, 95%CI = 0.95-1.19, P = 0.31; HR+HH versus RR: OR = 1.03, 95%CI = 0.93-1.13, P = 0.56; HH versus RR+HR: OR = 1.10, 95%CI = 0.78-1.56, P = 0.57; HH versus RR: OR = 1.09, 95%CI = 0.83-1.44, P = 0.53; HR versus RR: OR = 1.02, 95%CI = 0.92-1.13, P = 0.75). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis demonstrates that there is no association between the SULT1A1 R213H polymorphism and CRC.
