PURPOSE: We investigated the surface characteristics and vascular patterns of colorectal tumors according to growth type by means of magnifying narrow-band imaging (NBI). METHODS: Four hundred ninety-seven colorectal tumors larger than 10 mm (204 tubular adenomas [TAs], 199 frankly invasive intramucosal carcinomas to shallow invasive submucosal [M/SM-s] carcinomas, and 94 deeply invasive submucosal [SM-d] carcinomas) were analyzed. These colorectal tumors were classified according to growth type as follows: polypoid type, n = 224; laterally spreading tumor-granular (LST-G) type, n = 133; and LST-non-granular (LST-NG) type, n = 140. Surface and vascular patterns were evaluated in relation to histology and growth type. RESULTS: The absent and irregular surface patterns were observed in approximately 40 % of the SM-d carcinomas of the polypoid and LST-G type. The unclear surface pattern was more frequent in tumors of the LST-NG type than in those of other growth types, regardless of histology. Among TAs and M/SM-s carcinomas, the dense vascular pattern was most frequent in polypoid type, the dense and corkscrew vascular patterns were most frequent in the LST-G type, and the honeycomb and avascular and/or fragmentary patterns were most frequent in the LST-NG type. The avascular and/or fragmentary vessel pattern was more frequent in SM-d carcinomas than in TA and M/SM-s carcinomas, regardless of growth type. CONCLUSIONS: A part of LST-NG was difficult to identify the NBI magnifying surface pattern. Although NBI magnifying findings were almost same in each type lesion in SM-d lesion, those of LST-NG were different from those of LST-G and polypoid type in M/SM-s lesion.
