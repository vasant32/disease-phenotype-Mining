Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer morbidity and mortality in Western countries. One of the risk factors for colorectal tumorigenesis is vitamin D insufficiency. The aim of this study was to establish whether increasing dietary vitamin D intake can prevent or delay development of chemically induced preneoplastic lesions in the colon of mice. We fed six weeks old female C57BL/6J mice (n=28) with increasing vitamin D(3) concentrations (100, 400, 1000, 2500, 5000IU/kg diet). To induce dysplasia, a preneoplastic lesion, we injected mice with the carcinogen azoxymethane (10mg/kg) intraperitoneally, followed by three cycles of 2% dextran sodium sulfate salt, a tumor promoter, in the drinking water. To test our hypothesis that high vitamin D intake prevents formation of preneoplastic lesions, we have investigated the effect of increasing dietary vitamin D on development of premalignant colorectal lesions, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) (25-D(3)) levels, and expression of renal vitamin D system genes. Dietary vitamin D concentration correlated inversely with dysplasia score (Spearman's correlation coefficient, ρ: -0.579, p=0.002) and positively with serum 25-D(3) levels (ρ: 0.752, p=0.001). Increasing dietary vitamin D concentration beyond 1000IU/kg led to no further increase in circulating 25-D(3) levels, while the dysplasia score leveled out at ≥2500IU/kg vitamin D. High dietary vitamin D intake led to increased renal mRNA expression of the vitamin D catabolizing enzyme cyp24a1 (ρ: 0.518, p=0.005) and decreased expression of the vitamin D activating enzyme cyp27b1 (ρ: -0.452, p=0.016), protecting the body from toxic serum levels of the active vitamin D metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-D(3)). Our data showed that increasing dietary vitamin D intake is able to prevent chemically induced preneoplastic lesions. The maximum impact was achieved when the mice consumed more than 2500IU vitamin D/kg diet. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Vitamin D Workshop'.
