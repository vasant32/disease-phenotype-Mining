Colorectal cancer represents the fourth commonest malignancy, and constitutes a major cause of significant morbidity and mortality among other diseases. However, the chemical therapy is still under development. Angiogenesis plays an important role in colon cancer development. We developed HMQ18-22 (a novel analog of taspine) with the aim to target angiogenesis. We found that HMQ18-22 significantly reduced angiogenesis of chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and mouse colon tissue, and inhibited cell migration and tube formation as well. Then, we verified the interaction between HMQ18-22 and VEGFR2 by AlphaScreen P-VEGFR assay, screened the targets on angiogenesis by VEGF Phospho Antibody Array, validated the target by western blot and RNAi in lovo cells. We found HMQ18-22 could decrease phosphorylation of VEGFR2(Tyr(1214)), VEGFR1(Tyr(1333)), Akt(Tyr(326)), protein kinase Cα (PKCα) (Tyr(657)) and phospholipase-Cγ-1 (PLCγ-1) (Tyr(771)). Most importantly, HMQ18-22 inhibited proliferation of lovo cell and tumor growth in a human colon tumor xenografted model of athymic mice. Compared with normal lovo cells proliferation, the inhibition on proliferation of knockdown cells (VEGFR2, VEGFR1, Akt, PKCα and PLCγ-1) by HMQ18-22 decreased. These results suggested that HMQ18-22 is a novel angiogenesis inhibitor and can be a useful therapeutic candidate for colon cancer intervention.
