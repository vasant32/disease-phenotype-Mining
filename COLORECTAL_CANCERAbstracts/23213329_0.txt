Background. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between MSI and sporadic colorectal cancer in Guilan province, North part of Iran. Materials and Methods. A total of 96 patients who underwent resection for sporadic colorectal cancer in Guilan province were studied. No patients had positive family history of cancers. The frequencies of MSI were analyzed by testing the BAT-26 and BAT-25 markers. Results. MSI analysis revealed that 22.9% of the tumors (22 patients) were microsatellite instability positive and 77.1% (74 patients) were microsatellite instability negative. The highest rate of MSI (40.9%) was found in the rectal region. MSI-H status was seen more frequently in distal tumors (P = 0.04, odds ratio = 3.13, 0.96-10.14). Conclusions. Distal tumor location and MSI may associate with special clinicopathological features. It seems that there may be correlation with underlying genetic and immunologic mechanisms.
