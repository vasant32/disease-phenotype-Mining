 PURPOSE: Studies investigating the associations between GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk in Chinese population have reported controversial results. Thus, a meta-analysis was performed. METHODS: Four hundred and seven relevant records were identified through a literature search up to September 7, 2011, and 19 studies were finally included, involving a total of 3,130 CRC cases and 6,423 controls. Subgroup analyses were performed by language and study design. Statistical analysis was performed with the software programs Review Manager (version 5.1.2) and STATA (version 11.0). RESULTS: For the GSTM1 polymorphism, the null genotype of GSTM1 was not associated with CRC risk in Chinese population (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.97-1.28). Similar associations were found for GSTT1 polymorphism (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.94-1.29) and the dual null genotype of GSTM1/GSTT1 (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 0.93-1.71). For subgroup analyses, studies published in English and population-based studies further identified these associations for the three aspects above in Chinese population. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that the null genotypes of GSTM1 and GSTT1 and the dual null genotype of GSTM1/GSTT1 were all not risk factors in CRC in Chinese population.
