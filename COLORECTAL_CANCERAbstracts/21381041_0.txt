 BACKGROUND: Regenerating islet-derived family members (Reg) are superfamily of calcium-dependant lectins that are expressed in the proximal gastrointestinal tract and ectopically at other sites in the setting of tissue injury. The regenerating islet-derived family member 4 (RegIV) gene has been reported in various cancers, associating with diverse functions. This study examined the relation of the relative expression of RegIV gene to clinicopathological factors and outcomes in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: We studied surgical specimens of cancer tissue and adjacent normal mucosa obtained from 202 patients with untreated CRC. The relative expression levels of RegIV mRNA in cancer and in normal adjacent mucosa were measured by quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: RegIV gene expression was higher in cancer tissue than in adjacent normal mucosa. The multivariate analysis of clinicopathological factors for 5-year overall survival showed a higher level of RegIV gene expression was a significant independent predictor. Overall survival at 5 years differed significantly between patients with high RegIV gene expression and those with low expression. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of the RegIV gene is considered a useful independent predictor of outcomes in patients with CRC.
