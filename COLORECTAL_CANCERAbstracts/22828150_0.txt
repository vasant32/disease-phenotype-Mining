 BACKGROUND: p38-Alpha mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) is a tumor suppressor often mutated in human cancers, but its specific role in colorectal cancer is not completely understood. Previous studies have found that p38-MAPK activity inhibits epithelial proliferation and promotes apoptosis in the intestine. Therefore, we sought to test the hypothesis that intestinal disruption of p38-MAPK would lead to increased tumorigenesis in the colon. METHODS: p38-MAPK was deleted in mice within the intestinal epithelium using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre system under control of the villin promoter [villin-Cre ERT2(+), MAPK14(f/f)]. An azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate protocol was used to drive intestinal tumor development. Tumor measurements were made using computer software from photographs of excised colon specimens. RESULTS: The number of mice that developed tumors was not statistically different when comparing wild-type mice (7/14) to inducible, intestine epithelial-deleted p38-MAPK (9/11) mice after azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate treatment (P = .21). However, the epithelial-deleted p38-MAPK mice developed significantly more tumors (3.7 vs 1.1; P = .008) and nearly 4 times the total tumor burden as wild-type mice (17.4 vs 4.8Â mm(2); P = .03). Wild-type and epithelial-deleted p38-MAPK groups demonstrated a similar degree of colon inflammation. CONCLUSION: Deletion of p38-MAPK within the colonic mucosa leads to a hyperplastic state promoting greater tumor development. Because the severity of colitis was not augmented in mice with p38-MAPK deficiency, tumor development is likely mediated by impaired cell cycle regulation within the colonic epithelium. Manipulation of p38-MAPK activity may provide a novel treatment and/or prevention strategy in the management of colorectal cancer, particularly in the setting of inflammatory bowel disease.
