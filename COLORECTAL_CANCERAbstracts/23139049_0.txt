PURPOSES: The benefit of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for liver-limited metastatic colorectal cancer is still controversial. This study defined the resectability regardless of the size and number of liver metastases, and attempted curative hepatic resection in all cases. METHODS: Sixty-four patients that tolerated chemotherapy were diagnosed with CLM (colorectal liver metastases) without extrahepatic metastase from January 2007 to November 2010, and received an oxaliplatin-based regimen. This study assessed the resectability after chemotherapy, and the patients were divided in two groups; the resected and unresected group. Sixteen patients underwent hepatic resection without chemotherapy. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients underwent surgical resection (resected group) and twenty-nine patients were considered unresectable (unresected group). All 35 patients in the resected group safely received oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy safely without serious adverse effects. No serious postoperative complications were observed. The median overall survival (MST) was significantly higher in the resected than in the unresected group (56.93 [95 % CI 38.13-75.73] and 25.07 months [95 % CI 17.87-32.26], respectively; P < 0.001). The median disease-free survival was 20.2 [95 % CI 8.82-31.65] months in the resected group. CONCLUSION: Preoperative chemotherapy for CLM is well tolerated and does not increase postoperative complications. Curative surgery with preoperative chemotherapy has the potential to improve the overall survival in patients with CLM.
