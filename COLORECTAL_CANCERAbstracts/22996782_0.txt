We describe a case of metastatic lung cancer from colon cancer resected successfully after preoperative chemotherapy. A 68-year-old male patient underwent low anterior resection for colon cancer in October 2004 (Stage III a), transcatheteric hepatic arterial embolization (TAE) for liver metastasis (S5) in October 2005, and partial hepatectomy (S5) in February 2006. Forty-seven months after surgery, lung metastases were detected. He was treated with bevacizumab plus FOLFOX/FOLFIRI, but the lung metastases progressed. Panitumumab plus FOLFIRI was performed and a partial response was obtained. Partial pulmonary resection was performed done in June 2011. It is necessary to add many cases to decide the value of prognostic factor, surgical indication and effectiveness of preoperative chemotherapy for lung metastasis of colorectal cancer.
