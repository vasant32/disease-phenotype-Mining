Until recently peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) arising from colorectal cancer (CRC) was considered to be a terminal disease manifestation. Despite palliative systemic chemotherapy (CHT) the majority of patients died within a few months. Nowadays cytoreductive surgery (CRS) of the peritoneal cavity in combination with hyperthermic intraperitoneal CHT and perioperative systemic CHT may offer a chance for long-term survival in selected groups of patients. In this study we report the results obtained with this treatment strategy in 30 consecutive patients. Data were assessed prospectively. After a median follow-up of 16.9 months the median survival time in all 30 patients reached 24.3 months. Favorable prognostic factors are a low extent of intraperitoneal metastases as characterized by a low peritoneal cancer index (median survival PCI ≤ 10: 33.2 months vs. PCI 11-19: 12.1 months) and a complete or nearly complete CRS (median survival CCR 0/1: 33.1 months vs. CCR2/3: 12.1 months). The 2-year overall survival was 89% for patients with a PCI ≤ 10 and 65% for those with surgical CCR 0/1 cytoreduction. As not every patient with CRC and PC may profit from this relatively aggressive therapy an interdisciplinary patient selection (tumor board) and treatment in experienced surgical oncology centers is recommended.
