 BACKGROUND: Currently, no guidelines exist for the treatment of patients with multiple colorectal adenomas (MCRAs) (>10 but <100 synchronous nondiminutive polyps of the large bowel). This retrospective study aimed to investigate the clinical and molecular factors related to different treatments for MCRAs. METHODS: Patients with MCRAs were consecutively enrolled from January 2003 to June 2011. Sequencing of their APC and MutYH genes was performed. The clinical, molecular, and family histories of the patients were collected using the Progeny database. The patient treatments were divided into three groups of increasing clinical weight: endoscopic polypectomy, segmental resection, and total colectomy. A logistic regression analysis of clinicomolecular factors related to different treatment options was performed. RESULTS: The study comprised 80 patients (32 women, 40%) with a median age of 53 years (range 13-74 years). The median number of polyps was 33 (range 10-90).The cases included 62 diffuse polyposis, 18 segmental polyposis coli and synchronous colorectal carcinomas (CRC; 34 cases, 43%). The pathogenetic mutations were biallelic MutYH (n = 19, 24%) and APC (n = 4, 5%). The mean follow-up period was 74 months (median 43 months, range 1-468 months). Endoscopic polypectomy was performed in 25 cases (31%), segmental resection in 16 cases (20%), and total colectomy in 39 cases (49%). The logistics regression analysis, considering all the patients, showed that the number of polyps, the presence of CRC, and mutation were correlated with more intensive treatment. For the patients without CRC, only the number of polyps was correlated with the severity of the treatment (p > 0.0166). "On the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve, 25 was the number of polyps that best discriminated between surgical and endoscopic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with MCRAs undergo surgery. For patients without CRC, only the number of polyps, and not the presence of a disease-causing mutation, is correlated with increased heaviness of treatment. Patients with more than 25 polyps are more likely to undergo a surgical resection.
