The E-twenty-six (ETS) family of transcription factors is known to act as positive or negative regulators of the expression of genes that are involved in diverse biological processes, including those that control cellular proliferation, differentiation, hematopoiesis, apoptosis, metastasis, tissue remodeling, and angiogenesis. Identification of target gene promoters of normal and oncogenic transcription factors provides new insights into the regulation of genes that are involved in the control of normal cell growth and differentiation. The aim of the present investigation was to analyze the differential expression of 11 ETS (ELF-3, ESE3, ETS1, ETV3, ETV4, ETV6, NERF, PDEF, PU1, Spi-B, and Spi-C) as potential markers for prognostic of colorectal cancer. A series of paired tissue biopsies consisting of a tumor and a non-affected control sample were harvested from 28 individuals suffering from diagnosed colorectal lesions. Total RNA was isolated from the samples, and after reverse transcription, differential expression of the select ETS was carried out through real-time polymerase chain reaction. Tumor staging as determined by histopathology was carried out to correlate the degree of tumor invasiveness with the expression of the ETS genes. The results demonstrated a different quantitative profile of expression in tumors and normal tissues. ETV4 was significantly upregulated with further increase in the event of lymph node involvement. PDEF and Spi-B presented downregulation, which was more significant when lymph node involvement was present. These findings were supported by immunohistochemistry of tumoral tissues. The results suggest that select ETS may serve as potential markers of colorectal cancer invasiveness and metastasis.
