 INTRODUCTION: 8-Oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1), a key protein involved in the base excision repair pathway, can recognize and excise several lesions from oligodeoxynucleotides with single DNA damage. A C/G polymorphism at 1,245 bp (C1245G) in exon 7 of the OGG1 (Ser326Cys, rs1052133) is found to have a lower enzymatic activity. A variety of case-control studies have been published evaluating the association between OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism and colorectal cancer (CRC), though their conclusions were always contradictory. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This meta-analysis enrolled 12 studies to estimate the overall risk of OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism associated with CRC. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) were performed for codominant model (Cys/Cys versus Ser/Ser; Ser/Cys versus Ser/Ser), dominant model (Ser/Cys + Cys/Cys versus Ser/Ser) and recessive model (Cys/Cys versus Ser/Cys + Ser/Ser). RESULTS: No significant associations were found for Cys/Cys versus Ser/Ser (OR = 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92-1.53), Ser/Cys versus Ser/Ser (OR = 1.04, 95% CI 0.95-1.13), Ser/Cys + Cys/Cys versus Ser/Ser (OR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.98-1.16) and Cys/Cys versus Ser/Cys + Ser/Ser (OR = 1.11, 95% CI 0.90-1.38); moreover, in the stratified analyses, no significantly increased risk was found for all genetic models. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis suggests that the OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism is not associated with CRC risk.
