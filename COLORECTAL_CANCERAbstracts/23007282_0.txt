DISCUSSION:                  Internal fistulization of the colon to other organs, such as the urinary bladder, vagina, or small bowel is a relatively common complication associated with inflammatory diseases such as diverticulitis, Crohn disease, as well as neoplasia such as colorectal cancer or lymphoma. However, fistulization of the colon to the spleen is an exceedingly rare condition described by few in the literature.
