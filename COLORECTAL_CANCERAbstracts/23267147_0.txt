 BACKGROUND: Hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1 (HAVcR-1) may function as part of the regulatory apparatus for tight junction in human endothelial cells, and is overexpressed in renal cell and ovarian clear cell carcinomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HAVcR-1 expression in colorectal cancer and matched background tissues was determined using quantitative-PCR. HAVcR-1 was overexpressed in three colorectal cancer cell lines and the effect of this overexpression was assessed by changes in cell behaviour. RESULTS: HAVcR-1 expression was increased in colorectal cancer (p<0.001) and the disease-free time of patients with high levels of HAVcR-1 expression was significantly longer (p=0.045). HAVcR-1 overexpression reduced colorectal cancer cell adhesion and invasion (p<0.016). CONCLUSION: HAVcR-1 overexpression may be a diagnostic biomarker for colorectal cancer and a prognostic marker for a longer disease-free interval after surgery for colorectal cancer. HAVcR-1 overexpression can reduce cell adhesion and invasion and could thus be involved in the metastatic cascade.
