 AIMS: The assessment of lymphatic vessel density (LVD) has been suggested as a tool to determine the metastatic risk of neoplasias. On this premise, the authors aimed to verify whether progression risk of stage I colorectal cancer may be related to LVD. The authors also evaluated and correlated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A expression with LVD revealed in the same cases in order to investigate its potential lymphangiogenic role in the early stage colorectal cancer. METHODS: LVD and VEGF immunoexpression were analysed and compared in series of 29 stage I surgically resected colorectal carcinomas obtained from patients showing disease progression and in a cohort of 23 stage I colorectal cancers from patients with no evidence of disease progression. The prognostic value of LVD and of VEGF expression on the progression-free survival to colorectal cancer was investigated. RESULTS: A high density of peritumoural lymphatics (P-LVD) was significantly associated with high VEGF expression and disease progression. Moreover, high P-LVD and high VEGF expression were significant negative prognostic parameters associated with a shorter disease-free interval in stage I colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: If our findings are further confirmed in other studies, the assessment of P-LVD on surgical specimens might be used as a tool to identify patients with stage I colorectal cancer at higher risk of progression in order to submit them to adjuvant therapies. Since P-LVD seems to show a VEGF-A mediated regulation in stage I colorectal cancer, therapies targeting this factor might be exploited to reduce lymphangiogenesis and the progression risk of this neoplasia.
