We present the case of an 82-year-old man diagnosed with rectosigmoid cancer and liver metastasis who survived for 19 years following treatment. At the age of 64, the patient twice experienced mucus excretion for which he underwent a colonoscopy that resulted in a diagnosis of rectosigmoid cancer the patient underwent surgery for resection of the tumor and liver metastasis.  Histopathology was notable for a diagnosis of rectal adenocarcinoma that infiltrated the entire thickness of the wall, with metastasis to the liver and no lymph node involvement.  Post-operative chemotherapy was administered for about four months. The patient remained asymptomatic for 19 years which at that time he presented with liver metastasis, ascites and renal failure.
