The association of gastrointestinal malignancy with aplastic anemia has rarely been reported in the literature. Although it is not clear whether there is any direct relationship between aplastic anemia and gastrointestinal cancers, a retrospective analysis did suggest the notion that patients with aplastic anemia might have a higher incidence of colorectal cancer. Here, we report the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in managing a patient with aplastic anemia and advanced colorectal cancer. Early diagnosis is challenging due to overlapping symptomatology and clinical features, increased risk of diagnostic procedures, and confounding complications arising from aplastic anemia and its treatment. A high index of suspicion and multidisciplinary input are essential.
