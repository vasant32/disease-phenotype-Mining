Morphological and clinical heterogeneity of advanced colorectal cancer is probably caused by genetic variability in putative cancer stem cell genes, including Lgr5. Here, we investigated 23 variants of the Lgr5 gene in normal tissue, primary tumors, lymph node metastases and distant metastases of stage III and stage IV colorectal cancer patients. These data were compared to results of immunohistochemical Lgr5 expression analysis and to prognostic clinical parameters. No differences were found comparing germline and somatic Lgr5 genotype in primary tumors, but additional Lgr5 gene alterations could be demonstrated in lymph node and distant metastases. Significant negative correlation was seen between Lgr5 allelic variation and Lgr5 protein expression (p=0.0394), which mainly can be attributed to the negative influence of non-coding Lgr5 gene variations on Lgr5 protein expression (p=0.0166). Lgr5 gene variants could be found more frequently in primary tumors of stage III patients with increased time to recurrence, in distant metastases of patients with better survival and in lymph node metastases of patients with poorer survival compared to patients with Lgr5 wild type in primary and metastatic tissues, respectively. However, the analytic power of these prognostic data was low due to small sample size in the investigated groups. In conclusion, our data indicate that Lgr5 allelic variation affect Lgr5 protein expression in colorectal carcinomas. The somatic Lgr5 genotype seems to be relatively stable in primary tumors, but becomes vulnerable during the metastatic process of colorectal cancer. This instability has possibly prognostic importance, which has to be further evaluated by large cohort studies.
