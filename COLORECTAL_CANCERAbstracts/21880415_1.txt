A reverse phase protein microarray approach has been applied to quantify proteins of energy metabolism in normal and tumor biopsies of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The metabolic proteome of CRC specimens revealed a profound shift towards and enhanced glycolytic phenotype and concurrent mitochondrial alteration. The metabolic signature discriminated CRC patients with highly significant differences in overall and disease-free prognosis. The quantification of the bioenergetic signature of the tumor offers a relevant biomarker of CRC that could contribute in the handling of these patients.
