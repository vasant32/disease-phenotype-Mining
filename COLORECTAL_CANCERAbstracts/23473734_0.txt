PURPOSE: To prospectively assess the performance of teleradiology-based CT colonography to screen a population group of an island, at average risk for colorectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 514 patients living in Madeira, Portugal, was enrolled in the study. Institutional review board approval was obtained and all patients signed an informed consent. All patients underwent both CT colonography and optical colonoscopy. CT colonography was interpreted by an experienced radiologist at a remote centre using tele-radiology. Per-patient sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated for colorectal adenomas and advanced neoplasia ≥6mm. RESULTS: 510 patients were included in the study. CT colonography obtained a per-patient sensitivity, specificity, PPV and, NPV for adenomas ≥6mm of 98.11% (88.6-99.9% 95% CI), 90.97% (87.8-93.4% 95% CI), 56.52% (45.8-66.7% 95% CI), 99.75% (98.4-99.9% 95% CI). For advanced neoplasia ≥6mm per-patient sensitivity, specificity, PPV and, NPV were 100% (86.7-100% 95% CI), 87.07% (83.6-89.9% 95% CI), 34.78% (25.3-45.5% 95% CI) and 100% (98.8-100% 95% CI), respectively. CONCLUSION: In this prospective trial, teleradiology-based CT colonography was accurate to screen a patient cohort of a remote island, at average risk for colorectal cancer.
