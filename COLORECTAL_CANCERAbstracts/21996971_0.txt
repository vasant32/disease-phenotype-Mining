We describe four cases of locally advanced colorectal cancer resected successfully after preoperative chemotherapy conducted between April of 2007 and April of 2009. The average age of the patients was 66.3 years (range, 40-77 years). Because of tumor invasion into the surrounding organs, preoperative chemotherapy with FOLFOX4 was performed. The average number of courses of chemotherapy was 5.2 (range, 4-7). After chemotherapy, we were able to perform radical operations for all four cases. Histopathological examination of the tumor revealed Grade 3 in one case. There were no postoperative complications and no recurrences in any of the cases. We performed curative surgery after chemotherapy, and good results were obtained. Preoperative chemotherapy may be effective for avoiding excessive intervention surgeries such as total pelvic exenteration, preserving bladder and rectal functions, and for maintening QOL.
