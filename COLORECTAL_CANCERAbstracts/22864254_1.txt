We created gene-targeted pigs with mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene (APC) that are orthologous to those responsible for human familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). One-year-old pigs with the APC(1311) mutation (orthologous to human APC(1309)) have aberrant crypt foci and low- and high-grade dysplastic adenomas in the large intestine, similar to the precancerous lesions that develop in patients with FAP. Dysplastic adenomas accumulate Î²-catenin and lose heterozygosity of APC. This large-animal, genetic model of FAP will be useful in the development of diagnostics and therapeutics for colorectal cancer. DNA sequence data: NCBI accession number GU951771.
