A gene signature specific for intestinal stem cells (ISCs) has recently been shown to predict relapse in colorectal cancer (CRC) but the tumorigenic role of individual signature genes remains poorly defined. A prominent ISC-signature gene is the cancer stem cell marker CD44, which encodes various splice variants comprising a diverse repertoire of adhesion and signaling molecules. Using Lgr5 as ISC marker, we have fluorescence-activated cell sorting-purified ISCs to define their CD44 repertoire. ISCs display a specific set of CD44 variant isoforms (CD44v), but remarkably lack the CD44 standard (CD44s) isoform. These CD44v also stand-out in transformed human ISCs isolated from microadenomas of familial adenomatous polyposis patients. By employing knock-in mice expressing either CD44v4-10 or CD44s, we demonstrate that the CD44v isoform, but not CD44s, promotes adenoma initiation in Apc(Min/+)mice. Our data identify CD44v as component of the ISCs program critical for tumor initiation, and as potential treatment target in CRC.Oncogene advance online publication, 14 January 2013; doi:10.1038/onc.2012.611.
