This study was designed to assess the clinical value of magnifying endoscopy combined with EUS for estimating the invasion depth of colorectal tumors. We studied 168 colorectal adenomas and carcinomas that were sequentially examined by conventional endoscopy followed by magnifying endoscopy and EUS in the same session to evaluate invasion depth. Endoscopic images obtained by each technique were reassessed by 3 endoscopists to determine whether endoscopic resection (adenoma, mucosal cancer, or submucosal cancer with slight invasion) or colectomy (submucosal cancer with massive invasion or advanced cancer) was indicated. The accuracy of differential diagnosis was compared among the examination techniques. The rate of correct differential diagnosis according to endoscopic examination technique was similar. The proportion of lesions that were difficult to diagnose was significantly higher for EUS (15.5%) than for conventional endoscopy and magnifying endoscopy. Among lesions that could be diagnosed, the rate of correct differential diagnosis was the highest for EUS (89.4%), but did not significantly differ among three endoscopic examination techniques. When it is difficult to evaluate the invasion depth of colorectal tumors on conventional endoscopy alone, the combined use of different examination techniques such as EUS may enhance diagnostic accuracy in some lesions.
