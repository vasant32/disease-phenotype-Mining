 BACKGROUND/AIMS: To evaluate the clinical usefulness of serum placental growth factor (sPIGF) levels in stage III colorectal adenocarcinomas (CRC). METHODOLOGY: Serum PIGF were measured in 70 healthy controls and in 80 stage III CRC patients. Also the association between preoperative sPGF levels, clinicopathological features and patients survival were evaluated in stage III CRC patients. RESULTS: sPIGF levels in stage III CRC patients were significantly higher than those in controls. There was no significant association between sPIGF levels and clinicopathological features and sPIGF is not a prognostic factor for survival. Multivariate regression analysis showed the sPIGF levels (hazard ratio=3.28; 95% CI=1.10-9.5, p=0.032) to be significant independent factors for local recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Serum PIGF levels in stage III CRC patients are significantly higher compared with normal controls and may be an indicator of local recurrence in stage III CRC patients.
