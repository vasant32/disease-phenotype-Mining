miRNAs regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by degradation             of mRNA and translational repression. Recent studies have shown that miR-181a             is dysregulated in several types of cancer; however, the clinical significance             of miR‑181a in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. We addressed this question             by using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to analyze miR-181a expression in             162 CRC patients. There was no significant difference in miR-181a expression in             normal colon vs. colorectal cancer tissue. The cancer tissue samples were categorized             into a low and high expression group based on miR-181a expression. Comparison             of the clinicopathological factors and prognosis in these two groups showed that             the high expression group had a significantly poorer prognosis than the low expression             group (P=0.011). Multivariate analysis indicated that high miR-181a expression             was an independent significant prognostic factor for CRC. However, there no correlation             was observed between miR-181a expression and clinicopathological parameters. In vitro             analysis revealed that the overexpression of miR-181a repressed the expression             of the tumor suppressor, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) located on chromosome 10,             at the mRNA level. These data suggest that miR-181a may be a new independent prognostic             factor for CRC patients.
