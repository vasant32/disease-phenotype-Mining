According to their carcinogenesis, colorectal cancer (CRC) subtypes show distinct molecular parameters. Hereditary non-polypous colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is the most common inherited CRC characterized by clinical criteria and confirmed microsatellite instability (MSI). Interestingly, a recently identified subtype, familial colorectal cancer type X (FCC-X), shows the same clinical criteria but microsatellite stability (MSS). CEACAM1 is a known tumor suppressor that regulates apoptosis in colon cells, and its loss is one of the most frequent events in early tumorigenesis of CRC. Therefore its loss may characterize precursor colon cells prior to neoplastic transformation. We analyzed tumor specimens of HNPCC and FCC-X patients in order to investigate whether there is a loss of CEACAM1 expression analogous to sporadic CRC and whether the expression of CEACAM1 would distinguish between these tumor entities. No differences in CEACAM1 expression were noted between HNPPC (n = 38) and FCC-X (n = 30) tumors. CEACAM1 was reduced in near-identical frequencies in 36/38 (95%) HNPCC and 29/30 (97%) FCC-X. This is the first report to demonstrate the loss of CEACAM1 expression in hereditary CRC. There was no difference between HNPCC and FCC-X. The frequency of expression loss was comparable to sporadic CRC, indicating that loss of CEACAM1 is an early event in colorectal tumorigenesis linking the genesis of sporadic and hereditary CRC.
