This study was conducted to evaluate the association of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) gene family with colorectal cancer (CRC). The expression of members of the LRR gene family were analyzed in 17 CRC specimens and in 59 healthy colorectal tissues by using Human Exon1.0ST microarray, and in 25 CRC specimens and 32 healthy colorectal tissues by U133Plus2.0 microarray. An association was found for 25 genes belonging to the plant-specific (PS) class of LRR genes (P = 0.05 for Exon1.0 ST and P = 0.04 for U133Plus2.0). In both data-sets, in CRC, we found down-regulation of SHOC2 (P < 0.00003) and LRRC28 (P < 0.01) and up-regulation of LRSAM1 (P < 0.000001), while up-regulation of MFHAS1 (P = 0.0005) and down-regulation of WDFY3 (P = 0.026) were found only in the Exon1.0 ST data-set. The PS LLR gene class encodes proteins that activate immune cells and might play a key role in programmed cell death and autophagy. SHOC2 and LRRC28 genes involved in RAS-mediated signaling, which hinders nutrient deprivation-induced autophagy, might be a possible link between the negative control of autophagy and tumorigenesis.
