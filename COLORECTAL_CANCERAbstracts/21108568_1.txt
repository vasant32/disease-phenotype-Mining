 PURPOSE: In breast cancer patients, Mailliez and others described that 5 of 70 patients (7%) developed a bevacizumab-induced nasal septal perforation. However, to date, no studies have reported such rates in colorectal cancer patients, who derive a survival advantage with this drug. METHODS: This study examined the incidence of bevacizumab-induced, clinically symptomatic, otolaryngology specialist-confirmed nasal septal perforation among 100 patients who had been consecutively-treated for metastatic colorectal cancer. RESULTS: The incidence of nasal septal perforation was 1% (95% confidence intervals: -0.95% to 2.95%). This single adverse event was successfully managed conservatively. Within the whole group, 94 had been treated with bevacizumab at 5 mg/kg every two weeks, except for four patients treated at higher doses. The median number of bevacizumab doses (range) was seven (1-96). Concomitant chemotherapy had been prescribed to all patients, consisting of oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, as per one of the FOLFOX regimens (44 patients); irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, as per the FOLFIRI regimen (13 patients); both these regimens and no other (five patients); or a different regimen (38 patients). CONCLUSION: Nasal septal perforation from bevacizumab occurs infrequently among colorectal cancer patients.
