 BACKGROUND: The incidence of ovarian metastases at the time of peritoneal carcinomatosis, and the influence of such metastases on survival after cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), are unknown. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 194 women subjected to CRS and HIPEC since 2001. The incidence of ovarian metastases, disease-free survival and disease-specific survival were analysed. RESULTS: The histological diagnosis was colorectal cancer carcinomatosis in 108 patients, peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis (PMCA) in 23 and disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis (DPAM) in 63. Ninety-nine patients underwent oophorectomy during the HIPEC procedure. Ovarian metastases were confirmed in at least 52 per cent of the patients. There was a significant difference in disease-free survival between women with or without ovarian metastases in both PMCA and DPAM groups (P = 0·044 and P = 0·010 respectively). No significant differences in survival were found in the group with colorectal cancer carcinomatosis. CONCLUSION: When peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal or appendiceal origin is confirmed, at least 52 per cent of ovaries will have synchronous metastases. Disease-free survival after a HIPEC procedure for PMCA or DPAM is significantly lower in women with ovarian metastases. Oophorectomy during CRS for peritoneal carcinomatosis should be strongly considered.
