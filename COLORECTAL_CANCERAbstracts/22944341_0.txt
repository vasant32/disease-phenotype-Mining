Background/Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of MMP-7 and PTEN protein in colorectal cancer and explore its correlation with clinicopathological parameters. Methodology: In colorectal cancer tissue samples (n=48) and normal rectal tissue samples (n=23), the expression of MMP-7 and PTEN was detected by immunohistochemistry. Using medical records, the relationship of MMP-7 and PTEN expression with clinicopathological parameters was analyzed. Results: Compared to normal rectal tissue, MMP-7 expression was significantly higher in all grades of colorectal cancer. In contrast, PTEN expression was significantly lower than levels in normal rectal tissue. There was significant negative correlation between MMP-7 and PTEN expression in colorectal cancer (r=-0.403, p>0.05). MMP-7 and PTEN expression in colorectal cancer samples was correlated with differentiation, lymph node metastasis, serosa infiltration, and Duke's stage (p<0.05) but not with gender, age, or tumor size (p>0.05). Conclusions: Reduced PTEN expression and MMP-7 over-expression may play important roles in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Combined detection may provide prognostic benefit towards colorectal cancer.
