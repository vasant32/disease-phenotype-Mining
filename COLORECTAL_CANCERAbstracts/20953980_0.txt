 BACKGROUND: Whether developments in palliative care have impacted on where cancer patients die is unknown. We investigated time trends in place of death for colorectal cancer. METHODS: Details were abstracted on 10,175 colorectal cancer deaths during 1994-2004. Time trends were analysed by joinpoint regression. RESULTS: Nearly half (49%) of deaths occurred in acute hospitals, 29% at home, 13% in hospices and 7% in nursing homes. Hospital deaths were unchanged over time. Hospice deaths rose from 6% in 1994 to 17% in 2003. Home deaths decreased significantly, but only in health boards with hospices [estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) = -3.6%, 95%CI -4.19 to -2.97%, p < 0.001]. Nursing home deaths rose significantly in areas without hospices (EAPC = 8.0%, 95%CI 2.27 to -13.94%, p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Most colorectal cancer deaths occur in hospital. Availability of hospice facilities is a key determinant of where the burden of death falls. The results suggest unmet demand for hospice care in Ireland.
