 PURPOSE: The Korean National Cancer Screening Survey (KNCSS) is a nationwide survey conducted annually, since 2004. This study was conducted in order to report on trends in rates of cancer screening for five major cancers-stomach, liver, colorectal, breast, and cervix uteri in Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data collected by the KNCSS between 2004 and 2011 were used in this study. The eligible study population included cancer-free men who were 40 years old and over, and women who were 30 years old and over. Lifetime screening rate, screening rate with recommendation, and changes in annual rates were calculated. RESULTS: Both lifetime screening rates and screening rates with recommendation have increased since 2004. On average, screening rates with recommendation have shown an annual increase of 4.2% (95% CI, 3.3 to 5.2%) for stomach cancer, 1.1% (95% CI, -0.5 to 2.7%) for liver cancer, 2.2% (95% CI, 0.8 to 3.6%) for colorectal cancer, 4.0% (95% CI, 3.0 to 4.9%) for breast cancer, and 0.2% (95% CI, -0.9 to 1.3%) for cervical cancer. Increases in rates of cancer screening, with the exception of liver and cervical cancers, were significant, and screening rates for stomach and breast cancer in particular showed a marked increase. CONCLUSION: Cancer screening rates among Koreans showed a consistent increase from 2004 to 2011 and rates of screening for gastric, breast, and cervical cancer are approaching 70%.
