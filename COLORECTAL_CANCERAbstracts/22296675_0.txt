 BACKGROUND: To date the role of resistin in colorectal cancer (CRC) is far from being elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between serum resistin levels and CRC in relation to known risk/protective factors including anthropometric, metabolic, inflammatory parameters as well as lifestyle individual characteristics. METHODS: 40 CRC patients and 40 controls were enrolled. Body weight, height, waist circumference and blood pressure were recorded. Fasting plasma glucose, lipids, C-reactive protein (CRP) and resistin levels were measured. Metabolic Syndrome (MS) was defined according to the harmonized definition. RESULTS: Resistin levels were significantly higher in CRC patients than in controls (p=0.028) and gradually increased with tumor stage progression (p=0.042). A high resistin level was statistically significant determinant of CRC after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index and lifestyle parameters (p=0.029). Resistin showed a strong association with CRP levels (p â‰¤ 0.0001). In stepwise regression analysis CRP remained the only independent predictor of both resistin levels (p=0.001) and CRC risk (p=0.021). CONCLUSIONS: These results clarify the nature of the association between resistin and CRC risk suggesting that the proinflammatory state of cancer, rather than the clinical diagnosis of CRC itself or its link with obesity and MS, may govern this association.
