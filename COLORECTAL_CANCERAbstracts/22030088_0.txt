Aspirin and celecoxib prevent colorectal adenoma recurrence. Genetic variants in the UGT1A6 enzyme are associated with delayed aspirin metabolism and greater chemopreventive efficacy. We examined the effect of combining aspirin and celecoxib in relation to UGT1A6 T181A and R184S variants among 1,647 patients in the Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib (APC) trial who were stratified according to the use of low-dose aspirin after removal of adenomas and randomized to placebo, 200-mg twice daily, or 400-mg twice daily celecoxib for 3 years. Patients underwent follow-up colonoscopies at 1 and 3 years to assess on-treatment efficacy. At 5 years, 538 patients underwent a colonoscopy to assess risk of recurrence after treatment was discontinued for at least 1 year. During treatment, the relative risk (RR) of recurrent adenoma was 0.68 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.59-0.79] for 200-mg twice daily celecoxib and 0.54 (95% CI, 0.46-0.64) for 400-mg twice daily celecoxib compared with placebo. Aspirin use was not independently associated with recurrent adenoma (RR, 0.98, 95% CI, 0.86-1.15). These results did not vary according to UGT1A6 genotype. However, among those with a variant UGT1A6 genotype on aspirin, the RR of adenoma was 1.60 (95% CI, 0.81-3.15) after withdrawal of 200-mg twice daily and 1.98 (95% CI, 1.06-3.70) after withdrawal of 400-mg twice daily celecoxib compared with withdrawal of placebo. In contrast, there was no increased risk associated with discontinuing celecoxib among any other groups. Concurrent use of low-dose aspirin does not influence the efficacy of celecoxib in adenoma prevention. However, discontinuing celecoxib among aspirin-using individuals who initially developed adenoma despite a UGT1A6 variant genotype resulted in rapid reemergence of disease.
