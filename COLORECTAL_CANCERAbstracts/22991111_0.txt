This study identified the prevalence and predictors of fatigue in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Cross-sectional study with 157 adult CRC outpatients (age 60Â±11.7 years; 54% male; cancer stage IV 44.8%). The Piper Fatigue Scale-revised was used to assess fatigue scores. Socio-demographic, clinical, depression, performance status, pain and sleep disturbance data were assessed. Associations between fatigue and these data were analyzed through logistic regression models. Fatigue was reported by 26.8% patients. Logistic regression identified three predictors: depression (OR: 4.2; 95%CI 1.68-10.39), performance status (OR: 3.2; 95%CI 1.37-7.51) and sleep disturbance (OR: 3.2; 95%CI 1.30-8.09). When all predictors were present, the probability of fatigue occurrence was 80%; when none were present, the probability was 8%. The model's specificity and sensitivity were 81.9% and 58.6%, respectively. Through the assessment of depression, performance status and sleep disturbance, the probability of fatigue occurrence can be estimated, and preventive and treatment strategies can be rapidly implemented in clinical practice.
