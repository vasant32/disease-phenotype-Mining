The aims of this longitudinal study are to investigate general practitioners' opinions and knowledge about colorectal cancer screening in Trentino region, to identify their role and level of participation within the screening program and to find out their formative needs. 174 general practitioners answered the postal self-filled questionnaire: 82% of them asserted their main role in colorectal screening is patient counselling, but many physicians also showed availability to collaborate with the Centre for Health Services of Trento in organizing patients recruitment list and in recovering patients who didn't accept screening invitation. 78% thinks the Health Services of Trento should allocate incentives, especially push money, to promote physicians participation in screening program. Moreover 68% needs a basic formative course about screening programme. Female general practitioners are more prepared to collaborate in organizing patients recruitment list and in handing over the kit for fecal occult blood test than their male colleagues. Instead men prefer to take an active role in counselling and are more interested in economic incentives. The study has found considerable general practitioners support for the introduction of the new screening programme. The info-formative line to improve in Trentino could create a better interface between general practitioners and Centre for Health Services, keeping into account the organizing features of physicians. It seems to be important the definition of shared procedures for the counselling and the requirement of formative courses by general practitioners; the Centre for Health Services of Trento has already undertaken these courses disguised as seminars addressed all health operators.
