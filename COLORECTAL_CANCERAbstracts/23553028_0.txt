The HFE gene has been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. However, the results have been conflicting. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis to clarify the association of HFE gene C282Y variant with colorectal cancer. PubMed and Embase were retrieved to identify the potential literature. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI) was calculated using fixed- or random-effects model. A total of eight papers including nine studies (7,588 colorectal cancer cases and 81,571 controls) for HFE gene C282Y variant were included in the meta-analysis. The result indicated that HFE gene C282Y variant was significantly associated with colorectal cancer under recessive model (OR = 2.00, 95 % CI = 1.32-3.04), with no evidence of between-study heterogeneity (I (2) = 0.2 %, p = 0.432). Further subgroup analysis by number of cases suggested the effect was significant in studies with more than 500 cases (OR = 2.51, 95 % CI = 1.58-3.98, I (2) = 0.0 %, p = 0.921), but not in studies with less than 500 cases (OR = 0.75, 95 % CI = 0.28-1.97, I (2) = 0.0 %, p = 0.622). The current meta-analysis supported the positive association of HFE gene C282Y variant with colorectal cancer. Further large-scale studies with the consideration for gene-gene/gene-environment interactions should be conducted to investigate the association.
