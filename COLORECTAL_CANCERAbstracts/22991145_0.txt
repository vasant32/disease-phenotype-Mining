Existing colorectal cancer biomarkers are insufficient for providing a quick and accurate diagnosis, which is critical for a good prognosis. More appropriate biomarkers are thus needed. To identify new colorectal cancer biomarker candidates, we conducted a comprehensive differential proteomic analysis of six cancer cell lines and a normal cell line, utilizing a fluorogenic derivatization-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (FD-LC-MS/MS) approach. Two sets of intracellular biomarker candidates were identified: one for colorectal cancer, and the other for metastatic colorectal cancer. Our results suggest that cooperative expression of FABP5 and cyclophilin A might be linked to Her2 signaling. Upregulation of LDHB and downregulation of GAPDH suggest the existence of a specific nonglycolytic energy production pathway in metastatic colorectal cancer cells. Downregulation of 14-3-3ζ/δ, cystatin-B, Ran and thioredoxin could be a result of their secretion, which then stimulates metastasis via activity in the sera and ascitic fluids. We propose a possible flow scheme to describe the dynamics of protein expression in colorectal cancer cells leading to tumor progression and metastasis via cell proliferation, angiogenesis, disorganization of actin filaments and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Our results suggest that colorectal tumor progression may be regulated by signaling mediated by Her2, hypoxia, and TGFβ.
