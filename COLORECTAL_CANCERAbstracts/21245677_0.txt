Colorectal cancer (CRC) is an important public health issue in France, justifying a screening policy adapted to individual risk. The general practitioner (GP) is most commonly the initiator of CRC screening. The EDIFICE 2 survey, carried out in 2008 among 600 GPs, showed that 83% of GPs were convinced of the importance of screening, but that only 30% of GPs systematically recommended the procedure. The main underlying reasons were that only 50% of GPs declared themselves sufficiently trained, GPs needed clear guidelines and information supports for patients and a better implication in the programme's overall organization. This important role was confirmed by patients as the second most important reason for not undergoing screening: the absence of recommendation from their treating physician. The optimization of the screening procedure thus requires a stronger implication of GPs, by confirming their pivotal role in CRC screening and by relying on clear reference documentation guaranteeing quality assurance of a national organized screening programme.
