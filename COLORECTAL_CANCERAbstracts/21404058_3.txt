 BACKGROUND: Tissue factor (TF) is emphasized as the promising target in the future targeted therapy strategy for colorectal cancer (CRC). Recent evidence showed that TF expression is under the control of K-ras and p53. However, a comprehensive evaluation of TF expression, K-ras status, and p53 mutation has not been systematically analyzed. The aims of this study were to identify the percentages of positive TF in CRC patients; analyze the associations of TF expression, K-ras status, and p53 mutation; and evaluate the prognostic value of TF in CRC patients. METHODS: Ninety-six CRC samples were tested for TF expression, p53 mutation, and K-ras status by semiquantitative immunohistochemistry, Western blotting analysis, direct sequencing, and real-time quantitative PCR. Associations were sought with TF expression and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: TF expression was related to clinical stages, tumor differentiation, and tumor size. The positive proportions of TF expression on tumor cells and tumor vascular endothelial cells were 70% and 53% respectively in CRC patients. The positive proportion of TF co-expression on both cancer cells and tumor vascular endothelial cells was 40%, compared to an 83% total TF positive proportion in CRC patients. TF expression on CRC appeared to be increased with K-ras and/or p53 mutation(s). Disease-free survival and overall survival were significantly reduced in CRC patients with high TF expression. CONCLUSIONS: TF may participate in both K-ras and p53 mutations involved in colorectal carcinogenesis and could be considered as a prognostic indicator for patients CRC.
