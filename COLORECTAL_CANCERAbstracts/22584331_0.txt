There is a high frequency of serious side effects overseas in cases with a reduced creatinine clearance, for whom a 75% reduction in dose administration is recommended. The insidence of hematological toxicity was investigated in 89 cases[L group: Ccr<5 0mL/min(6 cases), M group: 50mL/min≤Ccr<80mL/min(34 cases), and H group: 80mL/min≤Ccr(49 cases)]who took capecitabine alone. The frequency of side effects was significantly high in group L[L: 6 cases(100%), M: 30 cases(88. 2%), and H: 30 cases(61. 2%)]. The frequency of grade 2 or more was higher in cases with a reduced renal function[L: 5 cases(83. 3%),M: 17 cases(50. 0%), and H: 18 cases(36. 7%)]. A significantly high decrease in hemoglobin was seen in group L[all grades; L: 5 cases(83. 3%),M: 20 cases(58. 8%), and H: 12 cases(24. 5%), and a grade 2 or more; L: 5 cases (83. 3%), M: 7 cases(20. 6%), and H: 5 cases (10. 2%)]. Moreover, there was little improvement when a decrease in hemoglobin occurred in grade 3 cases. Our findings suggest that it is necessary to manage drug dosage for Japanese patients while considering their renal function, and to actively monitor for any side effects.
