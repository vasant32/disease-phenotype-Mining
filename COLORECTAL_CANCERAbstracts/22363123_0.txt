 AIM: To investigate the expressions of leptin and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARG) in relation to body mass index (BMI). METHODS: We evaluated leptin and PPARG expression in 30 adenomas over 1 cm in size by immunohistochemical staining. In addition, clinicopathologic features including BMI were assessed. RESULTS: PPARG and leptin expression showed a strong positive correlation (P = 0.035). The average BMI of the leptin-positive group was higher than that of the leptin-negative group (25.4 ± 3.4 kg/m(2)vs 22.6 ± 2.4 kg/m(2), P = 0.018), and leptin expression was significantly correlated with high BMI (P = 0.024). Leptin expression was more frequently observed in intermediate/high grade dysplasia than in low grade dysplasia (P = 0.030). However, PPARG expression was not correlated with BMI and grade of dysplasia. CONCLUSION: BMI has influenced on the leptin expression of colorectal adenoma. The exact mechanism underlies the strong correlation between leptin and PPARG expression needs further study.
