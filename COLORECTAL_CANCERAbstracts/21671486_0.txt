 OBJECTIVE: To improve early diagnosis rate and reduce the incidence rate of colorectal cancer, through the application of optimized sequential screening scheme for colorectal neoplasm in general population. METHODS: Quantitative risk assessment by questionnaires survey and fecal occult blood test (FOBT) were used to proceed preliminary screening among people aged 40 to 74. Electronic colonoscopy was applied to examine the whole colon and rectum among identified high-risk subjects. The detected cases received treatment for colorectal cancer, adenomatous polyps or non-adenomatous polyps. The early diagnosis rate and incidence rate of colorectal cancer were evaluated and compared with those before screening. RESULT: With application of optimized sequential screening schemes, various types of colorectal lesions were detected in 1 117 subjects, including 69 cases of colorectal cancer, 701 cases of colorectal adenoma and 211 cases of advanced adenoma. The early diagnosis rate of colorectal cancer was increased by 58.19%, and its incidence rate also decreased significantly. CONCLUSION: The optimized sequential screening scheme is simple, economical, efficient in colorectal cancer screening of general population.
