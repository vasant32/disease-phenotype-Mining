 BACKGROUND: We previously investigated the mRNA expression of colorectal cancer cell lines via a microarray analysis and found several genes that were significantly up-regulated by oncogenic KRAS under serum-starved conditions. Of these genes, we focused on ribonucleotide reductase M2 (RRM2), which was reported to be associated with DNA synthesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell proliferation and colony formation assays were performed using HCT116 cells transfected with lentiviral RRM2-shRNAs. RESULTS: Under serum-starved conditions, the expression level of RRM2 protein increased in HCT116 cells compared to HKe3 cells (HCT116 cells with a disruption in oncogenic KRAS), and the re-expression of KRAS in HKe3 cells induced the expression of RRM2. Both the cell proliferation under serum-depleted conditions and the anchorage-independent growth were impaired by the reduction of RRM2 protein expression. CONCLUSION: RRM2 represents a novel therapeutic target, thus highlighting the potential utility of RRM2 inhibitors in colorectal cancer with oncogenic KRAS.
