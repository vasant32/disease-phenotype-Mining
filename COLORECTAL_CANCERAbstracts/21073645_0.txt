 AIM: This study analysed trends in polypoid colorectal cancer (PCRC) diagnosed by colonoscopy during the period 1995-2008 and compared the patterns observed in the years 2005-2008 with 1995-1998. METHOD: In the period 1995-2008, 24,245 colonoscopies were performed and 1041 patients with PCRC were diagnosed: pediculated (n = 220) or sessile (n = 821). RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 68.3 Â± 11.6 years. Males were more likely to have PCRC (males 62.6%vs females 37.4%; P < 0.0001). Significantly more pediculated PCRCs were located in the distal colon (P < 0.001). In the 2005-2008 period the prevalence of PCRC among patients undergoing colonoscopy decreased, the number of polypectomies increased significantly (P < 0.0001) and the pediculated PCRC location changed, with a significant increase in right-sided lesions. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of PCRC in patients undergoing colonoscopy decreased, with a significant increase in the number of polypectomies in the last decade. Pediculated PCRCs were more often located in the left colon and sessile PCRCs in the right colon. From the period 1995-1998 to 2005-2008 the location of pediculated PCRCs changed, with an increase in right-sided lesions.
