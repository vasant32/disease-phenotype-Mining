Recent studies have identified myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)             that are potent suppressors of tumor immunity and therefore a significant impediment             to cancer immunotherapy. It has been reported that MDSCs are generated by malignant             diseases or inflammation. However, no systematic studies in patients have been             described. In order to clinically characterize MDSCs, we tested PBMCs from patients             with various types of cancer including cholangiocellular, hepatocellular and pancreatic             carcinoma, esophageal, gastric and colorectal cancer, breast cancer and thyroid             cancer, and GIST, and those from normal volunteers using flow cytometry analysis.             A significant increase was seen in the percentages of MDSCs in PBMCs from patients             compared with normal volunteers. Among these patients, MDSC level was higher in             patients with cancer of the digestive system and patients with breast cancer compared             with normal volunteers. MDSC level was significantly and inversely correlated             to stimulation indices (SI) of PHA-blastogenesis of lymphocytes and serum concentration             of total protein, and positively correlated to neutrophil count. MDSC percentage             in patients with gastric and colorectal cancer was also significantly correlated             to neutrophil count and inversely correlated with lymphocyte count, and showed             highly significant correlation to neutrophil/lymphocyte rate (NLR). In patients             with breast cancer, MDSC levels in preoperative patients was significantly increased             compared to normal volunteers and significantly decreased in postoperative patients.             Thus, it is clear that MDSCs are increased in patients with cancer and closely             related to suppression of cell-mediated immune responses. These data also suggest             that they are related to chronic inflammation and that their levels are increased             further in the terminal stages of patients whose nutritional status is impaired             as observed in hypoproteinemia. MDSC levels have also been shown to decrease after             removal of tumors in patients with breast cancer.
