Prostate cancer screening rates are higher than colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates, despite the established benefit of screening in reducing CRC incidence and mortality. We used data from the 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to identify correlates of CRC screening among men who have undergone prostate cancer screening. Our sample included 41,781 men aged 50Â years and older who reported undergoing prostate cancer screening in the last year. More than two thirds (69.2%) of the men were up-to-date with CRC screening. On multivariable analysis, men who were younger, Hispanic, less educated, not married or partnered, employed, not a veteran, did not have a personal doctor, lacked a recent medical checkup, smoked, or were sedentary were less likely to be adherent to CRC screening. Tailored interventions targeted toward men who have already undergone prostate cancer screening may improve rates of CRC screening in a group that may be already aware of and interested in the benefits of cancer risk prevention. The prostate cancer screening encounter may represent a "teachable moment" to increase CRC screening rates.
