The xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C (XPC) is responsible for removal of bulky helix-distorting DNA lesions. Several polymorphisms of XPC gene may modulate the colorectal cancer (CRC) susceptibility. We assessed the association of XPC Lys939Gln (A/C), Ala499Val (C/T), and PAT (-/+) polymorphisms with CRC risk in a population-based case-control study which included 421 CRC patients and 845 controls. For Lys939Gln, the CC genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of CRC (odds ratio (OR)=1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.0-2.2) compared with the AA genotype. The subjects with PAT +/+ genotype had a significantly increased risk of CRC (OR=1.5; 95% CI=1.0-2.3), compared with those with PAT-/- genotype. Though no significant association between Ala499Val and CRC risk was observed, we found that individuals carrying the CT+TT genotypes showed a significantly decreased risk of rectal cancer (OR=0.7; 95% CI=0.5-1.0). Additionally, the haplotype C+C was associated with a significantly increased CRC risk (OR=1.3; 95% CI=1.0-1.6), compared with the most common haplotype A-T. Further, individuals with four or more risk alleles exhibited a significantly increased risk of CRC (OR=1.4; 95% CI=1.0-2.0), with a significant gene-dosage effect (P for trend=0.038). Besides, never tea drinking was associated with a significantly increased risk of CRC (OR=2.3; 95% CI=1.7-3.3). Our results suggest that the XPC polymorphisms may modulate CRC susceptibility independently or jointly, and tea drinking has a protective effect on CRC.
