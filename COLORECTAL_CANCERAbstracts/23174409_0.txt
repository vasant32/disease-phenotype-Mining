We recently proposed an S-1 combined with oxaliplatin (SOXL) regimen, a combination treatment consisting of oral metronomic S-1 dosing and intravenous administration of oxaliplatin (l-OHP) containing PEGylated liposomes, which showed potent antitumor activity in vivo. PEGylated liposomes induce what is referred to as the "accelerated blood clearance (ABC) phenomenon" upon repeated administration and consequently lose their long-circulating characteristics. This phenomenon seems to pose an impediment for the clinical application and use of PEGylated liposomal formulations. In the present study, l-OHP-containing PEGylated liposomes in the SOXL regimen significantly attenuated the ABC phenomenon in a dose-dependent manner through suppression of the anti-PEG IgM response, which allowed an enhanced hepatic uptake of subsequently injected test PEGylated liposomes. In tumor-bearing mice, the abrogation of the ABC phenomenon restored intratumor accumulation of subsequently injected PEGylated liposomes. Consequently, the therapeutic efficacy of the SOXL regimen over the combination of the free form of the drugs was credited not only with the selective delivery of drugs to the tumor tissue but also with ensuring an adequate accumulation of subsequent doses within the tumor tissue. The SOXL regimen we proposed may hold promise as a safe and effective treatment regimen for advanced colorectal cancer.
