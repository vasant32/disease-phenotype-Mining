CDH22, a member of the cadherins family, is highly expressed in the pituitary gland and the brain. It has been previously found that CDH22 is involved in morphogenesis and tissue formation in neural and non-neural cells of the brain and neuroendocrine organ. However, little is known about its role in colorectal cancer. Here the role of CDH22 in colorectal tumor was tested, and effects of inhibition of CDH22 expression on proliferation and metastasis were examined. We found that CDH22 was over-expressed at both transcriptional and translational levels in colorectal cancer and lymphatic metastasis of colorectal carcinoma, compared with normal colorectal mucosa. CDH22 over-expression was significantly associated with invasion and metastasis of colorectal cancer both at protein and mRNA levels. CDH22 knockdown partially blocked proliferation of colorectal cancer cells in vivo and in vitro. CDH22 knockdown was sufficient to attenuate invasion of colorectal cancer cells and inhibit tumor metastasis in a mouse model of colon surgical orthotopic implantation. Our results reveal for the first time a new role of CDH22 in progression of colorectal cancer.
