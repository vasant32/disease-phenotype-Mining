Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common and deadly forms of cancer. Despite improved treatment modalities, post-operative recurrence and metastasis remain the major problems for extending patient survival after surgery. This highlights the need to search for biomarkers for prognostication and treatment stratification of colorectal cancer patients. In this study, we applied the SYBR-green quantitative PCR-based array approach to screen for differentially expressed miRNAs between patients with short (<50 months, range 10-33 months) and long survival (â‰¥ 50 months, range 50-152 months). The selected candidate prognostic miRNAs were validated in a cohort of 50 CRC patients by TaqMan quantitative PCR. We found that high expression of miR-185 and low expression of miR-133b were correlated with poor survival (p=0.001 and 0.028, respectively) and metastasis (p=0.007 and 0.036, respectively) in colorectal cancer. Our findings suggest the potential prognostic values of these miRNAs for predicting clinical outcome after surgery.
