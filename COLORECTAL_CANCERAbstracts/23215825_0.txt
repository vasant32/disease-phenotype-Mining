 BACKGROUND: BRD7 is a member of bromodomain-containing protein and was found to be a cofactor of P53. Down-regulation of BRD7 has been shown in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines and tissues. However, the clinical role of BRD7 in colorectal cancer remains unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Real-time PCR, Western blotting analysis and immunohistochemistry were employed to examine BRD7 expression in CRC cell lines/tissues compared with normal epithelia cells/adjacent non-tumorous tissues. In addition, statistical analyses were applied to evaluate the diagnostic value and associations of BRD7 expression with clinical parameters of patient samples. RESULTS: BRD7 was down-regulated in colorectal cancer cell lines and cancerous tissues compared with that in normal colon epithelial cells and adjacent noncancerous tissue samples. BRD7 protein expression was positively correlated with clinical stage (P  <  0·001), T classification (P  =  0·001), N classification (P  <  0·001), M classification (P <  0·001) and pathologic differentiation (P =  0·008). Patients with low/none BRD7 expression had shorter overall survival time than those with higher BRD7 expression. Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated BRD7 expression was an independent prognostic factor (P < 0·001). CONCLUSION: BRD7 may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker of human colorectal cancer.
