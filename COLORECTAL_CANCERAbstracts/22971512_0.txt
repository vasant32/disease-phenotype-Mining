 OBJECTIVE: Mutation of the KRAS (v-Kiras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue) gene plays an important role in colorectal tumorigenesis. This study examined associations between KRAS gene mutations and clinicopathological and survival data in Chinese patients  with colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: CRC patients were recruited for the detection of KRAS gene mutations using polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. Data on clinicopathological features and survival times were collected. RESULTS: The study included 78 CRC patients. The overall  mutation frequency of the KRAS gene at codons 12 and 13 was 33.3% (26/78). KRAS gene mutations were significantly associated with poor tumour differentiation and liver metastasis. Patients with the wild-type KRAS gene had significantly higher median survival times than  patients with KRAS gene mutations (35.05 months versus 25.72 months). Those with KRAS gene mutations at codons 12 or 13 did not have significantly different median survival times (25.69 months versus 20.67 months, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a high  frequency of KRAS gene mutations exists in Chinese patients with CRC, and that such mutations are associated with poor survival, tumour differentiation and liver metastasis in CRC patients.
