Systemic treatment for metastatic or advanced colorectal cancer(mCRC)has remarkably progressed during recent years. All previously untreated mCRC patients at our institution between November, 2007 and June, 2010 were retrospectively evaluated. Of 72 patients, 39 were treated with chemotherapy alone, and 33 were treated with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab(BV). The median progression-free survival(mPFS)was 329 days in the group given chemotherapy plus BV, compared with 209 days in the group given chemotherapy alone(p=0. 0189). In sub-group analysis of those treated with chemotherapy plus BV, mPFS between 70 y/o<and<70 y/o was not different(368 vs 306 days, respectively; p=0. 7872). The relative dose intensity of oxaliplatin(L-OHP)was 80% in the group with FOLFOX+BV(n=15), and 92% with XELOX+BV(n=8). Chemotherapy with BV for previously untreated mCRC was well tolerated and effective.
