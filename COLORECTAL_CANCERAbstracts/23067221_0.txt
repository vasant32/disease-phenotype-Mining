Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is a malignancy of worldwide increased incidence. The vast majority of all CRC cases occur in patients older than age 50. The initial stage at the time of diagnosis has a strong influence on the overall survival (OS). According to AJCC sixth edition system, 5-year stage-specific survivals are over 90% in stage I, but only approximately 8% in stage IV [1]. Chemotherapy in combination with biological treatment has improved response rates (RR), with prolongation of progression free survival (PFS) and OS. Important role in treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) plays surgical resection of metastases. Multidisciplinary cooperation between medical oncologist, surgeon, radiologist and radiotherapist is necessary to achieve the best therapeutic results. The aim of our analysis was to describe the efficacy of bevacizumab used in combination with chemotherapy in the first-line setting and to evaluate frequency of thromboembolic complications during the treatment. The analysis included 58 patients with mCRC, who have been treated with first-line chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab at the St. Elizabeth Cancer Institute in Bratislava since 2006 and first assessed for the first therapeutic results in October 2010. The clinical benefit after the treatment represented by overall response rate (ORR) and stable disease (SD) was achieved in 87.93% of patients, and surgical resection of metastases after therapy underwent 12.07% of patients. Median time to progression (TTP) was 8 months and median OS evaluated in October 2011 was 27 months. Mutation status of KRAS gene had no influence on the effectiveness of treatment and BRAF mutations exhibited a strong negative prognostic significance. Thromboembolic complications were present in 17.24%. Keywords: metastatic colorectal carcinoma, first-line treatment, biological treatment, molecular markers, bevacizumab-related toxicity.
