Background: The aim of this study was to outline the trend in the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in the city of Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), for comparison with previously published national CRC data. Materials and Methods: A retrospective data analysis was performed on all cases of CRC diagnosed between January 2000 and December 2006 amongst Saudi patients in Jeddah using data retrieved from the Saudi Cancer Registry (SCR). Descriptive analysis was performed and results were compared to national CRC data from the SCR. Results: In Jeddah, 644 cases of CRC were diagnosed during the time period, accounting for 15% of all CRC cases in KSA. Males were more commonly affected than females (58% versus 42%). The male preponderance of CRC was similar to that observed at a national level. In Jeddah, the incidence was higher among those >45 years (77.0%), and the mean age at diagnosis was 57 years. At diagnosis, 10% of patients presented with localized disease; 25% presented with distant metastasis and the remaining patients had various stages of regional extension. Adenocarcinomas accounted for 72% of cases. Statistical analysis did not reveal any clinically significant differences between cases diagnosed in Jeddah and those diagnosed throughout KSA. Conclusions: The increased trend in the incidence of CRC in Jeddah between 2000 and 2006 mirrors the recent trend in KSA. This highlights the magnitude of this healthcare hazard, not only in Jeddah, but also across the country and supports the need for preventive measures and early detection of the disease.
