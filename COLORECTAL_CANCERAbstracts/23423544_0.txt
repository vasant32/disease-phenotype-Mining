Human matrix metalloproteinase-8 (hMMP-8) plays a important role in the progression of colorectal cancer, metastasis, multiple sclerosis and rheumetoid arthritis. Extensive MD-simulation of the PDB and solvated structures of hMMP-8 has revealed the presence of few conserved water molecules around the catalytic and structural zinc (ZnC and ZnS) ions. The coordination of two conserved water molecules (W and WS) to ZnS and the H-bonding interaction of WS to S151 have indicated the plausible involvement of that metal ion in the catalytic process. Beside this the coupling of ZnC and ZnS metal ions (ZnC - W(H) (W(1))…..W(2) ….H(162) - ZnS) through two conserved hydrophilic centers (occupied by water molecules) may also provide some rational on the recognition of two zinc ions which were separated by ~13 Å in their X-ray structures. This unique recognition of both the Zn(+2) ions in the enzyme through conserved water molecules may be implemented/ exploited for the design of antiproteolytic agent using water mimic drug design protocol.
