 AIMS: To further characterize discovered on GIST1 (DOG1) antibody clone K9 expression in a broad range of mesenchymal and epithelial tumours. METHODS AND RESULTS: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of various tumours were stained with the anti-DOG1 monoclonal antibody clone K9. The tumours (n = 187) included: gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) (n = 20); malignant melanoma (n = 19); schwannoma (n = 10); neurofibroma (n = 10); leiomyosarcoma (n = 10); low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (n = 5); angiosarcoma, (n = 10); epithelioid sarcoma (n = 5); clear cell sarcoma (n = 3); synovial sarcoma (n = 10); malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST) (n = 12); alveolar soft part sarcoma (n = 3); chordoma (n = 5); pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma (n = 5); perineurioma (n = 4); granular cell tumour (n = 6); acinic cell carcinoma (n = 5); adenocarcinoma, lung (n = 5), colon (n = 10), endometrioid (n = 10), prostate (n = 10) and renal cell (n = 10). Nineteen of 20 GISTs expressed DOG-1 and 12 of 20 were diffusely positive (â‰¥95%) with moderate to strong intensity. There was focal, predominantly luminal staining of colorectal (three of 10), endometrioid (four of 10) and acinic cell carcinomas (four of five). One case each of spindle cell/desmoplastic melanoma (2+), schwannoma (trace) and MPNST (2+) showed DOG-1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports that DOG-1 is a highly sensitive and specific marker for GISTs and also highlights hitherto unrecognized and unusual patterns of expression in non-mesenchymal neoplasms.
