Controlling chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting(CINV)is very important for the continuation of chemotherapy. CINV can significantly affect a patient's quality of life, leading to poor compliance with further chemotherapy treatment. In this retrospective study, we assessed the efficacy of palonosetron versus granisetron for the incidence of CINV induced by mFOLFOX6 and FOLFIRI in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Eighty-eight patients were included in the efficacy analyses: 39 patients in the palonosetron group and 49 patients in the granisetron group. The incidence of nausea in the granisetron group(Grade 1: 40. 8%, Grade 2: 10. 2% and Grade 3: 4. 1%)was significantly higher than in the palonosetron group (Grade 1: 25. 6% and Grade 2: 7. 7%, p=0. 0422). The incidence of vomiting and appetite loss in the granisetron group was not significantly higher than in the palonosetron group(p=0. 2419, p=0. 2648, respectively). This suggests that palonosetron exerts better efficacy against chemotherapy-induced nausea than granisetron in patients receiving mFOLFOX6 and FOLFIRI. Information on such analyses is useful to promote the effectiveness of cancer chemotherapy.
