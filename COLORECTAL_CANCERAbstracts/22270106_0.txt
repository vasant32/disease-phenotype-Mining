 OBJECTIVES: Patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) who have received oxaliplatin, 5-fluoropyrimidine, and irinotecan chemotherapy (with or without bevacizumab) and antiepidermal growth factor receptor therapy (if KRAS is wild type) have no further standard treatment options. Although repeating a prior chemotherapy [in particular, oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine (FOX)] is an option, there is very little evidence in the literature for this approach; thus, we reviewed our registry to assess the frequency and outcome of rechallenging with FOX. METHODS: Patients who had been rechallenged with FOX were identified from the South Australian metastatic CRC database. Patient characteristics were analyzed, and tumor response was retrospectively assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria. RESULTS: Twenty patients were eligible for inclusion in this analysis. The number of prior lines of therapy received for metastatic CRC was 4 lines for 2 patients, 3 lines for 6 patients, 2 lines for 7 patients, and 1 line for 3 patients, with 3 patients having received oxaliplatin as adjuvant therapy. Four patients had received bevacizumab previously, 7 patients had undergone antiepidermal growth factor receptor treatment, and 4 patients had undergone liver resection earlier. Response rate was 18%, and 47% had stable disease. The median progression-free survival was 3.7 months, median overall survival was 7.8 months, and 1-year survival was 37%. CONCLUSIONS: In this selected population, there is evidence of modest activity of rechallenge with FOX chemotherapy, although radiologic response is uncommon.
