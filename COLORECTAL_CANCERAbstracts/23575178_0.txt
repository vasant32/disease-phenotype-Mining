For aging, people having malignant disease are increasing. And surgical resection is an important part in the treatment of pulmonary metastasis from colorectal cancer. We analyzed the treatment outcome and prognostic factors affecting survival in our subset of patients. We have experienced 64 operations of metastatic lung tumors from colorectal cancer for 23 years since January 1988. Various factors affecting prognosis are studied based on 5-year survival in this report. Overall 5-year survival rate was 38.7%. The disease-free intervals more than 2 years, a solitary metastatic pulmonary lesion and the serum level of prethoracotomy carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were significantly affecting factors on the prognosis. Furthermore, sequential study for 23 years couldn't demonstrate the prognostic improvement by the advance of the thoracoscopic technology or the development of the new anti-cancer drugs, though the treatment of patients with pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer continues to evolve. The role of pulmonary metastasectomy is very important to reduce the volume of metastatic lesions for the better prognosis.
