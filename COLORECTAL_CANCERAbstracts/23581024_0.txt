 BACKGROUND: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is well feasible and effective method for treatment of colorectal cancer liver metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From September 2009 to December 2011, 11 patients with 15 inoperable liver metastases of colorectal cancer were treated by SBRT using Varian Clinac iX linear accelerator. We treated 6 men and 5 women of age from 51 to 81 years (median 68). SBRT doses ranged from 40 to 56 Gy (median 54 Gy) and were administered in 3 to 8 fractions. RESULTS: Local control rates at 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 months after completion of SBRT were 100%, 91%, 91%, 67% and 50%, respectively. Disease progression-free survival rates at 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 months were 82%, 82%, 64%, 50% and 50%, respectively. Median follow-up was 15 months. No severe side effects were attributed to the therapy. CONCLUSION: Our study assessed the feasibility of SBRT in selected group of patients with 1 to 3 colorectal cancer liver metastases with no other treatment option. We achieved excellent local control and very moderate acute and late side effects. Distant metastases were the most common recurrence form after SBRT. SBRT demonstrated excellent local control and resulted in occasional long-term survivors without any serious side effects of therapy.
