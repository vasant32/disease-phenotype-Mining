 BACKGROUND/AIMS: To examine the clinical and protein expression characteristics of tumor tissues for prediction of prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODOLOGY: We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological data of patients with stage T3N0 CRC, operated between 1997-2003 and the surgical materials for the relation between disease prognosis and p53, p21, p16, β-catenin, E-cadherin, EGFR, hMLH1, hMSH2 and TS protein expressions. RESULTS: A significantly shorter 3-year disease free survival was observed in patients under the age of 50. The worst 5-year overall survival (OS) observed for patients over 70. Tumor localization and number of processed lymph nodes significantly affected prognosis. The EGFR, hMSH2 and TS expressions and the 5-fluorouracyl treatment were not found to be of prognostic value; p53 and p21 positivity had significantly worse survival. When β-catenin membrane expression disappeared on tumor cells, the 5-year OS rate decreased and time to metastasis shortened significantly. Membrane β-catenin expression, processed lymph nodes number and age were detected as independent prognostic markers. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the evaluation of a clinicopathological profile, based on age, tumor localization, number of examined lymph nodes, p53, p21 and E-cadherin β-catenin expression appears to be useful in identifying high risk patients.
