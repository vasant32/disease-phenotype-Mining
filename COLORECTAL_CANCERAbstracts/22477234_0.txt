Demographic, medical history, physician factors, knowledge, beliefs and perceived barriers related to colorectal cancer (CRC) and CRC screening were compared for age-eligible individuals who received asymptomatic colonoscopy screening (n=100) versus those who did not receive any kind of CRC screening (n=142). All participants had health insurance that covered the full cost of colonoscopy screening. Screeners were more likely to have lower levels of income and education, to know the purpose of a colonoscopy, believe it was more normative, and report fewer barriers. Addressing these and other factors associated with CRC screening warrant testing as empirically based interventions.
