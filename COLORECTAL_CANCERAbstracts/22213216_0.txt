Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C and G (XPC, XPG) play important roles in DNA damage repairing machinery. Genetic variations in the XPC and XPG may be associated with increased risk for colorectal carcinoma (CRC). In this study, we evaluated the relation between the XPC Lys939Gln, XPG Asp1104His polymorphisms, and CRC susceptibility in a population-based case-control study, which included 1,028 CRC cases and 1,085 controls. Compared with the corresponding wild genotypes, we found that individuals with at least one copy of the XPC Lys939Gln (AC or CC genotype) and XPG Asp1104His (GC or CC genotype) had an increased risk for CRC. In addition, the variant genotypes of the XPC Lys939Gln AC/CC (P = 0.027) or XPG Asp1104His GC/CC (P = 0.003) reduced the elevation of preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level. Moreover a significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) after Oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy was observed in patients with XPG Asp1104His wide-type GG genotype (n = 432, Log-rank test: P = 0.033). Cox proportional hazards analyses demonstrated that variant genotypes of XPG Asp1104His [hazard ratio (HR)â€‰= 1.692, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.202-2.383, P = 0.003] as well as pathology grade (HR = 2.545, 95%CI: 2.139-3.030, P < 0.001), and lymph node metastases (HR = 1.851, 95%CI: 1.306-2.625, P < 0.001) were predictive of shorter PFS for the CRC patients with Oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy. In conclusion, the current data suggested that XPC Lys939Gln and XPG Asp1104His polymorphisms might contribute to the identification of patients with increased risk for CRC.
