 BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated beneficial immunological effects of fever-range whole-body hyperthermia (FR-WBH) as an adjunct to non-surgical cancer therapy. We conducted a study of preoperative FR-WBH in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery to evaluate perioperative, hyperthermia-induced immunomodulation. METHODS: The trial was conducted as a subject-blinded, controlled, randomized study. Subjects in the FR-WBH group (n=9) were treated with FR-WBH before operation under propofol sedation; the target core temperature was 39 (0.5)°C with 1 h warming and 2 h plateau phase. Subjects in the control group (n=9) were treated with propofol sedation only. Blood samples were acquired before and after treatment, after operation, and 24, 48 h, and 5 days after the end of surgery. The following parameters were measured: lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin (IL)-6/10, heat shock proteins (HSPs) 60, 70, and 90, human leucocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR), and LPS-binding protein (LBP). RESULTS: HSPs were increased in the FR-WBH group after treatment [HSP60, 48 h postop: 143 (41)% vs 89 (42)%, P=0.04; HSP90, postop: 111 (33)% vs 64 (31)%, P=0.04; HSP70: P=0.40; FR-WBH vs control, P-values for area under the level/time curve]. TNF-α levels were elevated after surgery in the control group and remained near baseline in the FR-WBH group [24 h postop: 73 (68)% vs 151 (72)%, P=0.04]. PCT increased in both groups 24 h after surgery; in the control group, this increase was significantly higher (P=0.02). There were no significant differences for IL, HLA-DR, or LBP. CONCLUSIONS: The immune system to react to surgical stress, as measured by a panel of laboratory indicators, might be improved by preoperative FR-WBH.
