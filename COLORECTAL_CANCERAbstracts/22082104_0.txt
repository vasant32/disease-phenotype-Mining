A novel approach to the prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC) recurrence by the local, luminal application of the combined therapies: Nutlin-3 (NUT) and the liposomal preparation of doxorubicin, Doxil(*) (Doxil) is presented here. The two drug entities were loaded into calcium alginate beads, engineered to erode upon exposure to a de-crosslinking agent, to allow for the controlled, concomitant release of the two. The synchronized release-driven improved cytotoxicity of NUT and Doxil was tested in vitro in RKO (wild-type p53) and HT-29 (mutant p53) CRC cells, by measuring intracellular expression of p53, p21 and Mdm2, as well as monitoring cell proliferation and viable cell numbers. NUT treatment alone was identified to be cytotoxic exclusively towards RKO cells. However, coadministration of NUT enhanced Doxil's anti-proliferative effects and cell death induction in a synergistic manner in both cell types. It was also identified that combinatorial treatment in a wt p53 context affected the p53 pathway by elevating the expression of p53 and its target p21. The capability of the formulation to erode in the presence of a de-crosslinking agent was demonstrated in vivo in the cecum of the anesthetized rat using indomethacin as a poorly water-soluble PK probe.
