We studied the specific changes of the secreted protein clusterin and its cytoplasmic precursor regarding colorectal tumorigenesis, using in vitro differentiation of Caco-2 cells. In tumor-like stage, we observed an overexpression of both precursor and secreted clusterin, corroborated in the cell line SW-480. Noticeably, SW-620 cells (from a tumoral node, thus with metastatic capacity) did not show overexpression of either precursor or secreted clusterin, suggesting a downregulation related to local metastasis. We further investigated clusterin in serum, finding a significant increase in colorectal cancer patients, with 81% sensitivity, 79% specificity, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.85.
