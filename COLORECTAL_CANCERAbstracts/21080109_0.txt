Na+-dependent glucose cotransporter (SGLT1), reported overexpression in tumor tissues while its clinical significance was not established, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with potential relation to SGLT1 were studied in order to investigate their clinical significance in colorectal cancer (CRC). Eighty-five patients of CRC who received chemotherapy in Sun Yat-sen Cancer Center from March 1st 2005 to December 31st 2008 were enrolled. SGLT1 and EGFR expression in these cancer tissues and 28 normal tissues were tested by immunohistochemistry. (1) Expression of SGLT1 (P = 0.00) and EGFR (P = 0.01) in cancer tissues was higher than that in normal tissues. (2) Their expression related with clinical stage (P = 0.03 and P = 0.02), but not with other clinical characteristics. (3) For first-line chemotherapy, expression of SGLT1 (P = 0.06 and P = 0.21) and EGFR (P = 0.37 and P = 0.31) had no influence on objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR). EGFR overexpression was associated with lower disease-free survival (P = 0.00) and overall survival (P = 0.01), while SGLT1 did not (P = 0.79 and P = 0.34). Conclusions Both SGLT1 and EGFR overexpression in CRC was related to higher clinical stages. SGLT1 had a potential impact on the ORR of first-line chemotherapy in CRC. EGFR was associated with prognosis, while SGLT1 did not.
