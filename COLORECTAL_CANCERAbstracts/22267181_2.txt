The clinical significance of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) including cancer             stem cells (CSCs) (CTC/CSC) in the tumor drainage vein blood of patients with             colorectal cancer (CRC) is unclear. In this study, we investigated the prognostic             value of CTC/CSC that express carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) cytokeratin 19 (CK19),             CK20 and/or CD133 (CEA/CK/CD133) mRNA in the tumor drainage blood of CRC patients             with Dukes' stage B and C. We examined tumor drainage blood from 197 patients             with Dukes' stage B and C CRC. CTCs that expressed CEA, CK19, CK20 and CD133 mRNA             were detected using the quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase             chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Each mRNA level was normalized with GAPDH mRNA             levels. In the relationship between the expression of CEA/CK/CD133 in the tumor             drainage blood and clinicopathological factors, a significant correlation was             observed between CEA/CK/CD133 expression and Dukes' stage (p<0.041). In CRC             patients with Dukes' stage B and C, disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS)             of patients with CEA/CK/CD133 positive in the tumor drainage blood were significantly             worse than that of marker gene negative patients. In contrast, in patients with             Dukes' stage A, no significant differences were shown between these groups. By             Cox progression analysis, it was shown that CEA/CK/CD133 mRNA in tumor drainage             blood was an independent prognostic factor for DFS and OS in patients with Dukes'             stage B and C. These results suggest that detecting CEA/CK/CD133 mRNA in tumor             drainage blood by the real-time RT-PCR method would have a prognostic value in             CRC patients with Dukes' stage B and C.
