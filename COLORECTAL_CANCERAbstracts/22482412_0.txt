 AIM: To construct  and express the recombinant ND-1-scFv/SEA,  a fusion protein of superantigen (staphylococcal enterotoxinA, SEA)  and single-chain variable fragment of monoclonal antibody ND-1 against human clolorectal carcinoma,  and to enhance the targeted killing effect of SEA. METHODS: The expression of the fusion protein was induced in E.coli M15 by IPTG. Ni-NTA resin affinity chromatography was used to separate and purify the expressed product. The specific binding activity of the purified ND-1-scFv/SEA protein was examined by indirect immunofluorescence assay and the targeted-cytotoxicity was determined using MTT assay. RESULTS: The expressing vector of fusion gene ND-1scFv/SEA was constructed successfully. ND-1-scFv/SEA protein retained a high binding affinity to antigen-positive human colorectal cancer cell CCL-187 and had a stronger capability to activate PBMC and kill the target cells compared to SEA alone,  with a killing rate of 91% at 4  Î¼g/mL. CONCLUSION: ND-1-scFv/SEA fusion protein could specifically target colorectal cancer cell,  enhance the activity of kill tumor cell and has potential applications in the targeted therapy of colorectal cancer.
