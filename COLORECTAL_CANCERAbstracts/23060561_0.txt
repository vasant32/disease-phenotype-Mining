BACKGROUND, MATERIALS AND METHODS: For the purpose of colorectal cancer detection, we investigated fibrillin-2 (FBN2) methylation in the serum of colorectal cancer patients using quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (qMSP). RESULTS: Out of 78 patients with colorectal cancer, 49 (63%) exhibited methylation of FBN2 in their tumor tissue DNA, suggesting that FBN2 methylation frequently exists in colorectal cancer. We next examined the methylation status of FBN2 in the serum DNA of patients with colorectal cancer. Out of 49 serum samples, four (8%) exhibited FBN2 methylation in their serum DNA by qMSP, suggesting that FBN2 methylation exists in the serum of colorectal cancer patients. After completion of qMSP analysis in all specimens, clinicopathological data were correlated with the molecular analysis findings. Interestingly, methylation of FBN2 was found in the serum DNA of male (p=0.0167) patients, and in those with hepatic metastasis (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical sensitivity of this assay can be potentially improved by incorporating other common genetic targets such as p53 and KRAS. Advances in technology which will permit for rapid detection of an array of specific mutations and methylation would enhance the utility of this approach.
