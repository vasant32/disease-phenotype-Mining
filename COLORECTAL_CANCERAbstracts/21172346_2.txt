Colorectal cancer, a common cause of cancer related deaths in both sexes in western population is often due to persistent oxidative stress leading to DNA damage. Antioxidants scavenge free radicals and inhibit neoplastic process. Kaempferol, a flavonol widely distributed in tea, broccoli, grape fruit, brussels sprouts and apple, is claimed to have chemopreventive action in colon cancer. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of kaempferol on tissue lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status in 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine induced colorectal cancer in male Wistar rats and to compare its efficacy with irinotecan. Experimental colon cancer induced by 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine in rats mimic human colon cancer and therefore is an ideal model for chemoprevention studies. The rats were divided into six groups. Group 1 served as control. Group 2 received 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine (20 mg/kg body weight) subcutaneously once a week for four weeks. Group 3 received irinotecan (100 mg/kg body weight) intravenously once a week for four weeks with 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine. Groups 4 to 6 were given a daily oral dose of 50, 100, 200 mg/kg body weight of kaempferol with 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine. The total study period was 16 weeks. Kaempferol supplementation lowered 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine induced erythrocyte lysate and liver thiobarbituric acid reactive substances level and rejuvenated anti oxidant enzymes catalase, super oxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. The recovery of enzyme status was maximum at the dose of 200 mg/kg body weight and was comparable to irinotecan. Our study reveals that kaempferol could be safely used as a chemopreventive agent in colorectal cancer.
