The ability of cells to undergo cellular transitions, in particular, to switch between epithelial and mesenchymal states, might be highly advantageous during the progression of carcinoma. Using histological and immunohistochemical techniques, we here show that the injection into mice of spontaneously transformed NIH-3T3 cells generated fusocellular sarcomas, whereas NIH-3T3 cells that had been transformed by culturing with plasma from colorectal cancer patients gave rise to tumors that phenotypically resembled the carcinomas of the original cancer patients. Thus, plasma from cancer patients is able to transform NIH-3T3 fibroblasts into malignant epithelial-like cells, suggesting that such cells might undergo mesenchymal to epithelial transition during plasma-induced transformation.
