 BACKGROUND: Most cytoreduction with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy procedures are performed at academic tertiary referral centers with numerous surgical oncology faculty. The objective of this study was to review the postoperative morbidity and mortality data of our institution, a large community hospital. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent cytoreduction with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy at a single institution. Two surgical oncologists performed all the procedures between May 2005 and June 2011. RESULTS: We retrospectively analyzed 57 patients. The most common pathology being treated was pseudomyxoma peritonei (34 of 57; 59.6%), followed by colorectal cancer (9 of 57; 15.8%). Other types of cancer included peritoneal mesothelioma and gastric adenocarcinoma. The average surgery time was 6.9 hours. Approximately 51% of patients suffered grade 3 or 4 morbidity and there were no perioperative mortalities. CONCLUSIONS: Cytoreduction with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy can be performed at our institution with comparable outcomes as academic referral centers.
