Rapidly evolving techniques for analysis of the genome provide new opportunities for cancer therapy. For diffuse gliomas this has resulted in molecular markers with potential for personalized therapy. Some drugs that utilize pharmacogenomics are currently being tested in clinical trials. In melanoma, lung-, breast-, gastric- and colorectal carcinoma several molecular markers are already being clinically implemented for diagnosis and treatment. These insights can serve as a background for the promise and limitations that pharmacogenomics has for diffuse gliomas. Better molecular characterization of diffuse gliomas, including analysis of the molecular underpinnings of drug efficacy in clinical trials, is urgently needed. We foresee exciting developments in the upcoming years with clinical benefit for the patients.
