 BACKGROUND: To evaluate the clinical usefulness of serum levels of soluble form of endoglin in stage III colorectal adenocarcinomas (CRC) patients for detection of recurrence. METHODS: The case-control study consisted of 80 stage III CRC patients who underwent surgery with curative intent and 70 age-and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Serum levels of soluble form of endoglin (sol-end) were measured in both groups. Also, predictive factors of recurrence were evaluated using multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Serum levels of sol-end in stage III CRC patients were significantly higher than those in controls. There was not a significant association between serum levels of sol-end and clinicopathological features in CRC patients. Multivariate regression analysis showed the LNR (hazard ratio, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.46-4.34; p < 0.001), to be significant independent factors to estimate local recurrence in stage III CRC patients. CONCLUSION: Preoperative serum levels of sol-end do not seem useful as a marker for detection of recurrence in stage III CRC patients.
