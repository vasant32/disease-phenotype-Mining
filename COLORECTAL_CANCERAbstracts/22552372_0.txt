We examined the effects of hyperglycemic conditions on liver metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Angiotensin (A)-II increased growth, invasion, and anti-apoptotic survival in HT29 and CT26 cells. In contrast, angiotensinogen (ATG) increased these features in HT29 cells but not in CT26 cells. HT29 cells expressed A-II type 1 receptor, chymase, and rennin, whereas CT26 cells did not express renin. Renin expression and ATG-induced cell growth, invasion, and survival induced and increased as glucose concentration increased in HT29 cells and also CT26 cells. An inhibitor of renin or chymase abrogated A-II production in HT29 cells. Reduction of hepatic ATG production by cholesterol-conjugated antisense S-oligodeoxynucleotide suppressed liver metastasis of HT29 cells. An examination of 121 CRC patients showed that diabetes in CRC cases was associated with higher blood HbA1c, higher renin and A-II concentrations in the primary tumors, and higher incidence of liver metastasis than in nondiabetic cases. These results suggest that diabetes-associated angiotensin activation enhances liver metastasis of CRC and may therefore provide a possible target for antimetastatic therapy in CRC.
