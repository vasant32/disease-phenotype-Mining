 BACKGROUND: Yangzheng Xiaoji is a traditional Chinese medical formulation that has been shown to have anticancer actions in patients with various solid tumours. The mechanisms of the potential anticancer action of Yangzheng Xiaoji are unknown. In the present study, we investigated the direct effects of Yangzheng Xiaoji on a range of human cancer cell lines and investigated the possible mechanism(s) of its action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extract of Yangzheng Xiaoji (DME25) was prepared using dimethyl sulfoxide. The influence of DME25 on in vitro growth, adhesion and migration was examined using in vitro function assays. The effects on signalling protein kinases were assessed using western blotting. RESULTS: DME25 suppressed adhesion and migration of various cancer cell, including those of breast, prostate, lung, osteosarcoma and colorectal cancer. Further investigation showed an involvement of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway in the inhibitory effect on the adhesion of cancer cells by DME25. CONCLUSION: Yangzheng Xiaoji exerts its anticancer effects not only via synergistically working together with chemotherapy, but also by directly inhibiting adhesion and migration of cancer cells. The PI3K/AKT pathway is a potential signalling pathway targeted by Yangzheng Xiaoji.
