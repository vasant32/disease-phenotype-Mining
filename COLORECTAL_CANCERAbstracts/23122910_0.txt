 BACKGROUND: Specific International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes for laparoscopic procedures introduced in 2008 allow a more accurate evaluation of laparoscopic colorectal surgery. METHODS: Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2009, a retrospective analysis of surgical colorectal cancer and diverticulitis patients was conducted. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios comparing the outcomes of laparoscopic, open, and converted surgery. RESULTS: A total of 121,910 patients underwent resection for cancer and diverticulitis, 35.41% of whom underwent laparoscopic surgery. Compared with open surgery, laparoscopic surgery had lower postoperative complication rates, lower mortality, shorter hospital stays, and lower costs. Compared to open surgery, laparoscopic surgery independently decreased mortality, postoperative anastomotic leak, urinary tract infection, ileus or obstruction, pneumonia, respiratory failure, and wound infection. Converted surgery was independently associated with anastomotic leak, wound infection, ileus or obstruction, and urinary tract infection. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic colorectal surgery has lower postoperative complications, lower mortality, lower costs, and shorter hospital stays. Conversion had higher complications compared with laparoscopy. The use of laparoscopy should increase with efforts to minimize conversion.
