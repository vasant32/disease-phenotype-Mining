A 48-year-old man with respiratory discomfort was diagnosed with rectal cancer with carcinomatous lymphangiosis, together with lung and sternum metastasis. As the patient's performance status(PS) was 2, mFOLFOX6+bevacizumab (Bmab)therapy with a 20% reduction in the dose was started. Three courses of this treatment resulted in improved respiratory function, and his PS dropped to 1. A chest computed tomography(CT) scan taken after four courses of this treatment indicated that pleural effusion had almost disappeared, and that the shadow on the lung had also reduced. However, after 20 courses of this treatment the disease had progressed. The regimen was changed to irinotecan (CPT-11)+Bmab administration. All of these chemotherapeutic treatments were administered on an outpatient basis. Sixteen months after the diagnosis of rectal cancer, the patient died. In recent years, combination chemotherapy for unresectable colorectal cancer has become recognized as a standard regimen, though adverse effects frequently occur. Thus, intensive chemotherapy is not always recommended for patients with poor PS. In this report, we presented a case of pulmonary metastases from rectal cancer, carcinomatous lymphangiosis, and sternum metastasis that was successfully treated with mFOLFOX6+Bmab.
