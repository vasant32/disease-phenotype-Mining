 OBJECTIVES: Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) plays crucial roles not only in the regulation of circulatory homeostasis but also in the pathology of carcinomas. An insertion-deletion (I/D) polymorphism in intron 16 of ACE gene was identified to be functional. We aimed to investigate the association between ACE I/D polymorphism and risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). DESIGN AND METHODS: Using genomic DNA from 241 CRC patients and 299 control subjects, we genotyped the ACE I/D polymorphism using a polymerase chain reaction analysis. RESULTS: We found that patients carrying the D allele were associated with an increased risk of developing poorly differentiated cancer and metastasis compared with those carrying the I allele (OR=1.54, 95%CI, 1.04-2.28; OR=1.56, 95%CI, 1.08-2.26, respectively), although no significant association was observed between cases and controls in overall analysis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the ACE I/D polymorphism is likely to play a role in CRC progression.
