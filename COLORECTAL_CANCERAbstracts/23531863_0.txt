Recently our group completed a genome-wide linkage study investigating Australian and Spanish families with inherited risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). A minor linkage peak from that study located on chromosome 1 correlates with the location of a known CRC risk-modifying gene, prostaglandin synthase (PTGS2). PTGS2 encodes the inducible prostaglandin synthase enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Prostaglandins are implicated in the initiation of carcinogenesis and progression of tumours. Sequencing of PTGS2 in a small subset of affected individuals identified a high frequency of the minor C allele of single nucleotide polymorphism rs5275. We then genotyped the rs5275 polymorphism in 183 affected and 223 unaffected individuals from our CRC predisposed families. Tests for association in the presence of linkage were made using family-based association tests. The C allele was found to be significantly associated (P<0.01) with diagnosis of hereditary non-syndromic CRC (P=0.0094, dominant model) and an earlier age of diagnosis (P=0.0089, heterozygous-advantage model). Interestingly, by stratifying the age of diagnosis data, we observed a speculative gender-discordant effect. Relative to other groups, female CC carriers were diagnosed less when young, but by 60 years of age were the most at risk group. Conversely, CT carriers of both genders showed a consistently earlier diagnosis relative to TT carriers. Our results suggest potential differential age-and gender-dependent efficacies of chemopreventative COX-2 inhibitors in the context of non-syndromic colorectal cancer.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 27 March 2013; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2013.53.
