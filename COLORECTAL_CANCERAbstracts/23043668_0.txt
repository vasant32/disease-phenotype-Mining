 OBJECTIVES: This study describes the management of patients with bilobar colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). METHODS: A retrospective collection of data on all patients with CRLM who were considered for staged resection (n= 85) from January 2003 to January 2011 was performed. Patients who underwent one hepatic resection were considered to have had a failed staged resection (FSR), whereas those who underwent a second or third hepatic resection to produce a cure were considered to have had a successful staged resection (SSR). Survival was calculated from the date of diagnosis of liver metastases. Complete follow-up and dates of death were obtained from the Government of Quebec population database. RESULTS: Median survival was 46 months (range: 30-62 months) in the SSR group and 22 months (range: 19-29 months) in the FSR group. Rates of 5-year survival were 42% and 4% in the SSR and FSR groups, respectively. Fifteen of the 19 patients who remained alive at the last follow-up date belonged to the SSR group. CONCLUSIONS: In patients in whom staged resection for bilobar CRLM is feasible, surgery would appear to offer benefit.
