The functions of many long non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in human cancers have             not yet been elucidated. The long ncRNA HOTAIR is expressed from the developmental             HOXC locus located on chromosome 12q13.13. Previous reports have demonstrated             that HOTAIR associates with chromatin modifications in cooperation with the Polycomb             complex PRC2, and promotes breast and colorectal cancer metastasis. In this study,             we examined the clinical significance of HOTAIR expression in patients with hepatocellular             carcinoma (HCC). HOTAIR expression was detected in primary HCCs in 13 out of 64             patients. Patients with HOTAIR expression had significantly poorer prognoses and             a larger primary tumor size than those without HOTAIR expression, similar to studies             in breast and colorectal cancers. Moreover, introduction of human HOTAIR into             liver cancer cells revealed that HOTAIR promoted more rapid proliferation compared             to control cells. Thus, although the clinical significance of HOTAIR expression             in HCC may not be as pronounced as that in breast and colorectal cancers, the             current study demonstrates that HOTAIR expression is associated with HCC progression,             warranting further studies.
