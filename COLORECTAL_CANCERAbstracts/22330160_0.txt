Hyperplastic polyps of the colon have traditionally been considered benign lesions without risk of progression to malignancy. However, hyperplastic polyps are only part of the spectrum of polyps known as serrated polyps. These polyps, which share a common sawtooth appearance, include distinct subtypes of lesions that can potentially undergo malignant transformation to colorectal carcinoma through the serrated pathway. Therefore, to prevent this process, affected patients must undergo surveillance and lesions must be identified and resected. Studies presented this year at the congress of the American Gastroenterological Association have provided useful information to better characterize these lesions -particularly important for the prevention of colorectal cancer- and to establish appropriate surveillance strategies.
