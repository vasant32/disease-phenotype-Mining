 PURPOSE: Marine triterpene glycosides that are physiologically active natural compounds isolated from sea cucumbers (holothurians) and sponges have antifungal, cytotoxic, and antitumor activities, whose specific molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In this study, we examined if and through which mechanisms stichoposide C (STC) from Thelenota anax (family Stichopodidae) induces apoptosis in leukemia and colorectal cancer cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We examined STC-induced apoptosis in human leukemia and colorectal cancer cells in the context of mitochondrial injury and signaling pathway disturbances, and investigated the antitumor effect of STC in mouse CT-26 subcutaneous tumor and HL-60 leukemia xenograft models. RESULTS: We found that STC induces apoptosis in these cells in a dose-dependent manner and leads to the activation of Fas and caspase-8, cleavage of Bid, mitochondrial damage, and activation of caspase-3. STC activates acid sphingomyelinase (SMase) and neutral SMase, which resulted in the generation of ceramide. Specific inhibition of acid SMase or neutral SMase and siRNA knockdown experiments partially blocked STC-induced apoptosis. Moreover, STC markedly reduced tumor growth of HL-60 xenograft and CT-26 subcutaneous tumors and increased ceramide generation in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Ceramide generation by STC, through activation of acid and neutral SMase, may in part contribute to STC-induced apoptosis and antitumor activity. Thus, STC may have therapeutic relevance for human leukemia and colorectal cancer.
