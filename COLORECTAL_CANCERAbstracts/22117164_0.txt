From an endophytic strain of Gliocladium sp. isolated from the Amazonian plant Strychnos cf. toxifera, we obtained the diketopiperazine alkaloid cyclo-(glycyl-L-tyrosyl)-4,4-dimethylallyl ether (1), the steroids ergosterol (2), ergosterol peroxide (3), cerevisterol (4) and the citric acid (5). The AcOEt extract of the fermented broth by Gliocladium sp. showed potent activity against the cancer cell lines MDA-MB435 (human breast cancer cells), HCT-8 (human colorectal cancer cells) and SF-295 (human glioblastoma cancer cells). Compound 1 exhibited a strong antimicrobial activity against Micrococcus luteus at a concentration of 43.4 µM.
