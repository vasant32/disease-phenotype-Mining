 BACKGROUND: Resection is the treatment of choice for colorectal cancer liver metastases. OBJECTIVE: This is a retrospective, longitudinal, retrospective analysis of different prognostic factors for survival in a consecutive series of liver resection for metastatic colorectal carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between October 1998 and November 2007, we performed 89 liver resections for colorectal metastases. A retrospective analysis from the liver resection database was performed and the variables analyzed were related to demography, primary tumor and surgical procedure. Survival analysis was performed according to the Fong and Basingstoke scores. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 60.5 years and 67.4% were men. The primary tumor was localized in the colon in 73% of cases. In 68.5% the metastases were metachronous. The right hemiliver was involved in 46 patients (52%). Major hepatectomy was performed in 36 (40.2%), minor in 55 (59.8%) and combined procedures in 14 (15.7%). Seventy-seven (86.5%) R0 resections were achieved. Morbidity was 32.6%, with no perioperative mortality. Average follow-up was 32.5 months (range 1 to 158 months), with a median of 25.5 months. Median overall survival was 69.7 months and mean disease-free survival 58.7 months. Multivariate analysis found statistical significance for blood product requirement and margin of resection. Thirty-four patients are alive at the end of this study (45.9%). The Basingstoke predictive index for postoperative variables showed significant differences that were not demonstrated by the Fong clinical score on prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: The application of Basingstoke predictive index and Fong score with biomarkers may indicate the most appropriate therapeutic strategy in each patient with colorectal liver metastases.
