 PURPOSE: To investigate the expression of cytokeratin 20 (CK20) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the peripheral blood of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, and correlate the findings with the pathologic data of the patients. METHODS: This study was carried out on 50 subjects, 40 patients with histologically confirmed colorectal carcinoma undergoing elective surgery and 10 healthy individuals matched for age and sex. Total RNA extraction followed by real time quantitative RT-PCR and real time TaqMan quantitative assay for peripheral blood expression of CK20 and VEGF was done for both patients and controls. RESULTS: (1) Statistically significant high levels of CK20,VEGF, CEA (p = 0.000 each) and CA19-9 (p = 0.002) in CRC patients when compared with controls; (2) Statistically significant increase in the expression of CK20 in advancing CRC stage C (p = 0.001) and with LN metastasis (p = 0.000); (3) Statistically significant increase in the expression of VEGF in advancing CRC stage C (p = 0.002), pathologic grade (p = 0.038), and with LN metastasis (p = 0.004); and (4) statistically positive correlation between CK20 and VEGF expressions, and also between these markers and CEA level. CONCLUSION: CK20 and VEGF expressions in peripheral blood of CRC patients are promising molecular markers for CRC progression and metastasis.
