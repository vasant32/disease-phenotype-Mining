To assess the awareness and acceptability of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in noncompliant Singaporeans and to determine if their barriers can be overcome by education. A questionnaire developed from thematic analysis of open-ended interviews with 72 subjects was administered to 580 residents in a local high-rise housing estate. Participants aware of CRC screening were assessed for barriers and acceptability of CRC screening. All participants were subsequently educated about CRC screening and reassessed for barriers and acceptance. Those keen for fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) were offered FOBT kits and followed up. CRC screening awareness was poor. Having no symptoms was the most common barrier. More barriers to FOBT than to colonoscopy were reduced with education. After education, acceptability toward FOBT increased but rejection rates rose even higher. FOBT is probably Singapore's most acceptable screening modality. Education is limited by barriers, which need to be overcome by alternative measures.
