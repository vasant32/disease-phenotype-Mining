 PURPOSE: This study sought to prospectively determine the frequency of delayed nausea and vomiting with irinotecan-based chemotherapy following day 1 prophylaxis with a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone. METHODS: Patients with colorectal cancer aged ≥ 18 years with ECOG performance status ≤ 2 receiving irinotecan alone, combined with cetuximab or as part of a standard folinic acid, 5- fluorouracil, irinotecan (FOLFIRI) regimen for the first time were eligible. All patients received a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone 8 mg on day 1 prior to irinotecan. No routine prophylaxis for delayed emesis was given. Antiemetic outcome was recorded in patient-completed diaries for the 120-h study period after irinotecan administration. Primary endpoint was frequency of delayed (24-120 h) emesis. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were enrolled, and all are evaluable. The median age was 61 (39-79) years; the male-female ratio was 37:7. Four patients (9%) experienced vomiting or retching during the delayed period. Three patients (7%) vomited during the first 24 h after irinotecan. The overall no emesis rate was 89% (39/44). Fifteen patients (34%) experienced delayed nausea (mildin 11 patients, moderate in four patients). Six patients (14%) took rescue antiemetics during the delayed period. Delayed and overall complete response (no emesis or use of rescue antiemetics) rates were 82% and 77% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a 5-HT3 antagonist and dexamethasone prior to irinotecan results in excellent control of nausea and vomiting (CR 86%) during the 24 h after chemotherapy. Without further antiemetic treatment, most patients (82%) will not experience delayed emesis or require rescue antiemetics. Routine prophylaxis for delayed emesis following irinotecan does not appear to be warranted.
