 BACKGROUND: This paper tries to evaluate prognostic value of various pre and post-operative colorectal cancer markers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the study conducted in our clinic over a period of five years we tried to emphasize the biological factors of prognostic value in colorectal cancer, and to demonstrate the important role of these factors in predicting survival, but also of early relapse or, in some cases, resistance to chemotherapy. Most important component of these factors remains molecular tumor markers. RESULTS: Of the markers of tumor load increased preoperative serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) means increased risk of neoplastic recurrence and reducing survival expectancy. Aneuploidy tumor cells would have the same importance. CONCLUSIONS: Although for their study modern and expensive techniques are necessary, molecular tumor markers have an increasingly role appreciated by researchers both in estimating the risk of relapse and neoplastic dissemination and the response rate to adjuvant treatment. It is estimated that the study of molecular/genetic profile of colorectal tumors in the future will dictate therapeutic decisions ahead.
