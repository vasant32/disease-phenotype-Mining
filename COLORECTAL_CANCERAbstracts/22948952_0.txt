We previously established safety and immunogenicity of a p53 synthetic long peptides (p53-SLP®) vaccine. In the current trial, we investigated whether combination of interferon-alpha (IFN-α) with p53-SLP® is both safe and able to improve the induced p53-specific IFN-γ response. Eleven colorectal cancer patients successfully treated for metastatic disease were enrolled in this study. Of these, nine patients completed follow-up after two injections with p53-SLP® together with IFN-α. Safety and p53-specific immune responses were determined before and after vaccination. Furthermore, cryopreserved PBMCs were compared head-to-head to cryopreserved PBMCs obtained in our previous trial with p53-SLP® only. Toxicity of p53-SLP® vaccination in combination with IFN-α was limited to Grade 1 or 2, with predominantly small ongoing swellings at the vaccination site. All patients harbored p53-specific T cells after vaccination and most patients showed p53-specific antibodies. Compared to the previous trial, addition of IFN-α significantly improved the frequency of p53-specific T cells in IFN-γ ELISPOT. Moreover, in this trial, p53-specific T cells were detectable in blood samples of all patients in a direct ex vivo multiparameter flowcytometric assay, opposed to only 2 of 10 patients vaccinated with p53-SLP® only. Finally, patients in this trial displayed a broader p53-specific immunoglobulin-G response, indicating an overall better p53-specific T-helper response. Our study shows that p53-SLP® vaccination combined with IFN-α injection is safe and capable of inducing p53-specific immunity. When compared to a similar trial with p53-SLP® vaccination alone the combination was found to induce significantly more IFN-γ producing p53-specific T cells.
