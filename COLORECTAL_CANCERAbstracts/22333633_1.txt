We analyzed the relationship between Onodera's prognostic nutritional index(PNI), classified by serum albumin level, lymphocyte level, and clinicopathological features, in 46 patients with unresectable or recurrent colorectal cancer being treated with chemotherapy.Onodera 's PNI was distributed between 29.7 and 56.1(average 45.4±6.8 ).Onodera 's PNI showed a significant correlation with performance status and surgery before chemotherapy(p=0.002 and 0.002, respectively).Next, all patients were divided into two groups according to their Onodera's PNI values, based on the receiver operator characteristic curve.We found that Onodera's PNI showed a significant correlation with overall survival times(median survival time, 548 days(Onodera's PNI<47.8 ), 902 days(Onodera's PNI≥47.8 ), p=0.00065 ).This PNI could be a prognostic factor and a very useful objective screening tool for assessing the nutritional condition of those with unresectable or recurrent colorectal cancer being treated with chemotherapy.
