Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered to be the origin of cancer relapse             and metastasis. The better understanding of CSCs, including CSCs in human colorectal             cancer (CRC), may facilitate prevention and treatment. This study aimed to establish             a CSC enrichment model via the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition             (EMT) in CRC cells. We established an EMT model using the SW480 CRC cell line             by CDH1 knockdown using shRNA interference. CD24+CD44+ cells were enriched in             the CDH1 knockdown cells. The cells exhibited mesenchymal morphology and expressed             high levels of EMT-related proteins, which confirmed that these cells had undergone             EMT. Our results further showed that the proliferation rate of the transfected             cells was reduced, whereas their colony-forming capacity and tumorigenesis in vivo             was significantly enhanced compared to the control cells. In conclusion, these             cells were highly enriched CSCs (compared to normal CSCs) and may be used as a             stable model for cancer research and anticancer drug screening.
