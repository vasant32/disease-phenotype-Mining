 OBJECTIVE: Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is the best treatment of several peritoneal surface malignancies. Isolated peritoneal recurrence may be treated by iterative procedures. The aim of this study was to evaluate immediate postoperative and long-term results after iterative CRS-HIPEC. METHODS: From 1990 to 2010, 30 patients with isolated peritoneal recurrence underwent iterative procedures combining CRS-HIPEC. RESULTS: Origins of peritoneal carcinomatosis were ovarian, colorectal, pseudomyxoma peritonei, peritoneal mesothelioma, gastric cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, and primary peritoneal serous carcinoma. Median recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 16.2 months from the first procedure. After the second procedure, one (3.3%) postoperative death occurred. Severe morbidity following the second procedure was 40% versus 30% after the first procedure (P = 0.37). At most recent follow up, 11 patients were disease-free, 10 were alive with recurrence, and 9 were dead with recurrence. Five-year overall survival after initial CRS with HIPEC was 65%, and overall median survival from diagnosis was 140 months. CONCLUSION: Iterative procedures combining CRS-HIPEC are feasible and allow long-term survival but may result in significant morbidity and mortality. Patients must be carefully selected, based on the following criteria: Origin of carcinomatosis, magnitude of first procedure, length of RFS, physiological age, co-morbidity, and possibility of complete cytoreduction.
