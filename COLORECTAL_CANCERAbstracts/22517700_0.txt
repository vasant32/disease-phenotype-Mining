 PURPOSE: To investigate the influence of the angiogenesis parameter CD34 microvascular density (MVD) on overall survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. METHODS: Thirty-one CRC patients were followed-up for 72 months after curative colorectal operation. Blood vessels measurement was done using the CD34-MVD immunochemistry method, and light microscopy. RESULTS: MVD was inversely correlated with patients' survival. MVD value < 35 proved as independent good prognostic factor, and patients with this value lived during the 72-month follow up after surgery, while a MVD value > 65 was an independent poor prognostic factor and such patients died within 11 months after radical surgery for CRC (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: According to these results, the CD34-MVD seems to be a significant prognosticator of overall survival in CRC patients.
