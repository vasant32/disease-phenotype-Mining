Thirty-six metastatic colorectal cancer patients received every 2 weeks, as first- (17) or second-line (19) treatment a combined chronotherapy with CPT-11 (infused at day 1 from 2 to 8 a.m.; peak at 5 a.m.), given with 5FU (700 mg/m(2) per day; days 2-5) and folinic acid (300mg/m(2) per day; days 2-5) both infused from 10 p.m. to 10 a.m. with a peak at 4 a.m., and carboplatin (40mg/m(2) per day; days 2-5; infused from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.; peak at 4 p.m.). The doses of CPT11 could be easily pushed from 120 to 180mg/m(2) in successive cohorts in the phase I part of the study (11 cases). Twenty-five patients were then treated in the phase II of the trial. The overall toxicity was mild leading to dose-reductions in only 11-13% courses. The tumoral activity was interesting with 81% responses and 94% tumour control. Also prolonged survivals were recorded with 8.8months of progression free and 15.6months overall survivals. More prolonged survivals were observed in chemotherapy naive patients. Seven patients (19%) could be reoperated from their residual disease.
