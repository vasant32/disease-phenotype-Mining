Flow cytometry is well-known cell analysis method and useful to gain quantitative information from cells in blood, however, it is not widely used for solid tissues in clinical settings. This is partly because it takes a long time to prepare samples and the operation can be complicated. To resolve these problems, we developed a new automatic cell isolation system which consists of cell isolation unit and staining reagent kit specialized for flow cytometry. With this new system, cell isolation can be done more rapidly and easily. By using this method, we could determine optimum condition to disintegrate porcine colon tissue and stain cells stably in 6 minutes. This result indicates that our method can provide analysis data within 10 minutes. We also evaluated our method in colorectal cancer patients, and the result was promising. All the data suggests that this method can support and facilitate rapid diagnosis.
