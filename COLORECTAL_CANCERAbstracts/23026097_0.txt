 OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and correlates of meeting the public health strength exercise guidelines (â‰¥2 days/week) in colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors. METHODS: A random sample of 600 CRC survivors in Alberta, Canada, completed a mailed questionnaire assessing  medical, demographic, and behavioral variables and participation in strength exercise. RESULTS: About a quarter (25.5%) of CRC survivors were meeting strength exercise guidelines. In multivariate analysis, meeting guidelines was associated with being male (p = .052), married (p = .079),  a drinker (p = .006), in better health (p < .001), nonsmoking (p = .023), and nonobese (p = .010). CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to increase strength exercise participation in CRC survivors are needed.
