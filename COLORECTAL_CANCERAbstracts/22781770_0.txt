 OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of fast-track surgery on postoperative humoral immune function in patients undergoing elective colorectal resection. METHODS: Seventy patients with colorectal carcinoma requiring colorectal resection were randomized into fast-track group (n = 35) and conventional care group (n = 35). The clinical parameters and markers of humeral immune function were evaluated in both groups postoperatively. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients finally completed the study, including 32 in the fast-track group and 30 in the conventional care group. There was a significantly faster recovery of postoperative humoral immunity: blood levels of globulin (24.1 ± 2.4 vs 22.1 ± 3.3 g/L, P = 0.025), immunoglobulin G (10.79 ± 2.39 vs 8.66 ± 2.09 g/L, P = 0.007) and complement 4 (0.24 ± 0.09 vs 0.17 ± 0.05 g/L, P = 0.035) at Day 3 postoperation were higher in the fast-track group than in the conventional care group. And there was also a significantly shorter length of postoperative stay (6.0 ± 1.0 vs 11.7 ± 3.8 d, P < 0.001) in patients undergoing fast-track rehabilitation. CONCLUSION: Fast-track surgery accelerates the recovery of postoperative humoral immune function in elective surgery for colorectal carcinoma with a shorter length of postoperative hospital stay.
