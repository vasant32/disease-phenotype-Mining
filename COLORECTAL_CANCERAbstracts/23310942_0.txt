Purpose: Activation of the KRAS oncogene is implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis and mutations have been reported in 30-50% of cases. BRAF mutation, though less common, is also reported and importantly associated with shorter progression-free interval. This study aims to determine the KRAS and BRAF mutation statuses of Nigerian colorectal cancers (CRC). Methods: Mutation analysis was carried out on archival paraffin-embedded blocks of CRC tissues. KRAS codons 12, 13 and 61 and BRAF V600E were assessed by pyrosequencing after DNA extraction from 200 cases at the Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine, St. James's University Hospital, UK. Mutation rates and the spectra were determined. Results: Pyrosequencing was successful in 112 of 200 cases. KRAS mutation in codons 12 and 13 was demonstrated in 23 of 112 cases (21%); none in codon 61. BRAF mutation in codon 600 was demonstrated in 4.5%.  Conclusion: This study shows that 21% of Nigerian CRC patients carry a KRAS mutation; half the rate in Caucasians; and that BRAF mutation also occurs in Nigerian CRC cancers.
