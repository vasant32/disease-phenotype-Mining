 BACKGROUND: Colon carcinogenesis is associated with increased expression levels of Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4. AIM: To determine in a Caucasian population the role of Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4 polymorphisms in colorectal cancer development. METHODS: Hospital based multicentre case control study involving 193 colorectal cancer patients and 278 healthy individuals. DNA samples were extracted from blood cells and genotyping of TLR2+597T>C, TLR2-4760T>C, TLR4-3745A>G, TLR2Arg753Gln, TLR4Asp299Gly was performed. Functionality of risk polymorphisms was evaluated through production of TNF-α in cell culture and Toll-like receptors levels quantified by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: TLR2+597CC homozygous had 5-fold decreased risk (odds ratio (OR)=0.21, 95% CI: 0.09-0.50, p<0.001) and TLR4 299Gly homozygous 3-fold increased risk of colorectal cancer (OR=3.30, 95% CI: 1.18-9.28, p=0.015). In stratified analysis, TLR2+597CC genotype protective effect was even higher in overweight individuals (OR=0.17, 95% CI: 0.06-0.53, p<0.001) and in never smokers (OR=0.11, 95% CI: 0.02-0.51, p=0.001). Also, the increased risk effect for TLR4 299Gly homozygous genotype was higher in overweight individuals (OR=8.67, 95% CI: 1.11-87.85, p=0.011). TLR2+597T>C polymorphism conferred 41% less (p=0.03) and TLR4Asp299Gly 65% more TNF-α production (p=0.02) with no differences in Toll-like receptors levels. CONCLUSION: Functional Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4 polymorphisms significantly alter the risk to have colorectal cancer. Obesity and smoking may influence the risk for colorectal cancer in individuals presenting these genetic profiles.
