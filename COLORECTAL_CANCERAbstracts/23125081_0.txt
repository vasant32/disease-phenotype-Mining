 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: ST13, is the gene encoding the HSP70 interacting protein (HIP). Previous research has shown that ST13 mRNA and protein levels are down-regulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. This study aims at the role of ST13 in the proliferation and migration of CRC cells. METHODS: The transcript level of ST13 in different CRC cell lines was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). ST13-overexpressed and ST13-knockdown CRC cells were constructed respectively by lentiviral transduction, followed by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, plate colony formation, cell-cycle analysis, and migration assays to evaluate the influence of ST13 on proliferation and migration in vitro. Moreover, a mouse xenograft study was performed to test in vivo tumorigenicity of ST13-knockdown CRC cells. RESULTS: Lentivirus-mediated overexpression of ST13 in CRC cells inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, and cell migration in vitro. In contrast, down-regulation of ST13 by lentiviral-based short hairpin RNA (shRNA) interference in CRC cells significantly increased cell proliferation and cloning efficiency in vitro. In addition, down-regulation of ST13 expression significantly increased the tumorigenicity of CRC cells in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: ST13 gene is a proliferation regulator that inhibits tumor growth in CRC and may affect cell migration.
