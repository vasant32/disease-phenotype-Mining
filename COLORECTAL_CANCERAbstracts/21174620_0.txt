 AIMS: Survival and response rates in metastatic colorectal cancer remain poor, despite advances in drug development. There is increasing evidence to suggest that gender-specific differences may contribute to poor clinical outcome. We tested the hypothesis that genomic profiling of metastatic colorectal cancer is dependent on gender. MATERIALS & METHODS: A total of 152 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who were treated with oxaliplatin and continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil were genotyped for 21 polymorphisms in 13 cancer-related genes by PCR. Classification and regression tree analysis tested for gender-related association of polymorphisms with overall survival, progression-free survival and tumor response. RESULTS: Classification and regression tree analysis of all polymorphisms, age and race resulted in gender-specific predictors of overall survival, progression-free survival and tumor response. Polymorphisms in the following genes were associated with gender-specific clinical outcome: estrogen receptor Î², EGF receptor, xeroderma pigmentosum group D, voltage-gated sodium channel and phospholipase A2. CONCLUSION: Genetic profiling to predict the clinical outcome of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer may depend on gender.
