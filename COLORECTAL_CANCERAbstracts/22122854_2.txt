 AIM: Single port laparoscopic colorectal surgery (SPLC), performed through a single incision of â‰¤ 3 cm, has been shown to be feasible. This study aimed to assess its safety and efficacy when used as the method of choice for right hemicolectomy. METHOD: A prospective study was carried out of patients undergoing right hemicolectomy using a single port laparoscopic technique. They were compared with a historical series of patients undergoing right hemicolectomy using a multiport laparoscopic technique. Between December 2009 and September 2010, single port surgery replaced conventional laparoscopic colorectal surgery (LCS) for radical medial to lateral right hemicolectomy performed by a single surgeon. Histology, length of hospital stay, complications, conversions and readmissions were recorded. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were treated using single port laparoscopic surgery (SPLC): 10 for carcinoma (Dukes A1, B6, C3) and four for Crohn's disease. Twelve patients were treated using multiport laparoscopic colorectal surgery (LCS): eight for carcinoma (Dukes B4, C3, Carcinoid 1), three for Crohn's disease and one for adenoma. The median (interquartile range) operative time for the SPLC group was 120 (90-135) min and for the LCS group was 135 (116-150) min. The median (interquartile range) length of hospital stay was 3.5 (2.0-5.0) days for the SPLC group and for the LCS group was 4.0 (3.8-7.0) days. The median (interquartile range) number of lymph nodes removed for SPLC patients was 14.5 (9.8-19.5) and for the LCS patients was 14.5 (13.0-19.5). There were no conversions, no complications and no readmissions in either group. CONCLUSION: These data confirm the feasibility of the technique. Furthermore they suggest that it is safe and efficacious.
