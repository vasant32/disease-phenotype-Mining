In the pursuit to advance diagnostic procedures with colon carcinoma patients, we included the 15 MHz mini radial endoscopic ultrasound (MREUS) in our work up algorithm, following PH verification. When compared to surgical and final pathohistological (PH) findings, MREUS shows that it can differentiate colon layers in great detail and therefore we can determine the degree of carcinoma dissemination (T1, T2, T3, T4) as well as to make a correct therapeutic choice. MREUS (12-15-20 MHz) is a highly reliable colon layer structural analysis method. As we have shown in our study, the accuracy of T stage colon carcinoma visualization in correlation to equivalent PH studies varies from 90-100% which makes MREUS the best as well as the most reliable method in determining preoperative T stage colon carcinoma.
