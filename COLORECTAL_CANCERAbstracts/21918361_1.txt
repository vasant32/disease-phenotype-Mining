An 82-year-old female was diagnosed with rectal cancer. Hartmann's procedure was performed and a curative resection was successfully achieved. Postoperative staging according to the classification of the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum(The 7th Edition)was stage III. She received adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery with tegafur(UFT 300 mg/body/day)orally for 6 months. One year after the surgery, paraaortic lymph node metastasis and a local recurrence were diagnosed. She was treated with modified FOLFOX6 chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab. After 13 courses of treatment with FOLFOX6 and bevacizumab, multiple lung metastases were found. Therefore, we changed the chemotherapy regimens to FOLFIRI plus cetuximab. After 18 weeks of this new treatment she had two skin ulcerations around her stoma, a known side effect associated with cetuximab. We stopped cetuximab and continued chemotherapy with FOLFIRI alone. Seven weeks after cetuximab withdrawal, her skin ulcer healed with the support of a dermatologist and a wound ostomy continence nurse. We reintroduced cetuximab in a chemotherapy regimen with a reduced dose. After two infusions of cetuximab, skin ulceration recurred. We stopped cetuximab again and continued chemotherapy with FOLFIRI. Nine weeks later we resumed cetuximab, but this time the skin ulcer did not occur, and we were able to continue the chemotherapy regimen with FOLFIRI and cetuximab.
