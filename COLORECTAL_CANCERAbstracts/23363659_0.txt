Background/Aims: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the Western countries. Novel approaches of treatment are needed for CRC. The purpose of the present study was to investigate cytotoxic effect of external Qi of Yan Xin Qigong (YXQ-EQ) on human colorectal cancer cells. Methods: The effect of YXQ-EQ on viability, cell cycle progression and apoptosis in colorectal cancer HT-29 cells was investigated. Phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2, activation of NF-ĸB and the expression of proteins involved in regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis were examined by Western blot analysis. Results: YXQ-EQ markedly decreased viability and blocked colony formation of HT-29 cells. YXQ-EQ downregulated cyclin D1 expression and increased accumulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27, resulting in G1 cell cycle arrest. YXQ-EQ induced apoptosis in HT-29 cells in association with decreased expression of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-xL, XIAP, survivin and Mcl-1 and elevated expression of proapoptotic protein Bax. YXQ-EQ significantly repressed phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2 and NF-ĸB activation in HT-29 cells, suggesting that YXQ-EQ may exert cytotoxic effect through regulating signaling pathways critical for cell proliferation and survival. Furthermore, YXQ-EQ treated PBS and an YXQ-EQ treated plant extract induced apoptosis in HT-29 cells. Conclusion: These findings show that YXQ-EQ has potent cytotoxic effect on HT-29 cells and suggest that YXQ-EQ could be potentially used for colorectal cancer treatment either directly or indirectly via carriers.
