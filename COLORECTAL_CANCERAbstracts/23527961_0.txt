The critical step in colorectal cancer progression and associated mortality is cancer invasion, which depends on two key gelatinase enzymes, matrix metalloproteinases -2 and -9. Dried longan (Euphoria longana Lam.) seed is a rich natural source of antioxidant polyphenols. We studied the effect of dried longan seeds on colon cancer cell invasion via gelatinases function and expression. Three dried longan seed fractions were collected by Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography. They showed a potent inhibitor on colorectal cancer cell invasion and gelatinases activity. The anti-gelatinases activities of fraction 1 and fraction 2 were direct effect via Zn2+ chelation, whereas fraction 3 modulated indirectly through suppression of zymogen activators. Among the fractions, only fraction 3 reduced the gelatinases expression which was correlated with the levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 as well as may involve with the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases and the c-Jun N-terminal kinases signaling pathways. This primary research has manifested and encouraged the anti-cancer properties of dried longan seed extracts with the potential inhibitory effects on cancer cell invasion as well as anti-gelatinases activity and expression in colon cancer cells.
