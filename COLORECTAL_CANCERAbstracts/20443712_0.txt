MC3 and MC5 are both colorectal cancer-specific MAbs previously prepared in our laboratory that can detect colorectal cancer with high sensitivity and specificity. Thus far the distribution of MC3-Ag and MC5-Ag in colorectal cancer remains largely unknown. In the present study, we have firstly found that the expression of MC3-Ag and MC5-Ag was higher in moderate-differentiated and poor-differentiated colorectal cancer tissue than that in well-differentiated colorectal cancer tissue by immunohistochemistry. The expression of MC5-Ag in colorectal cancer tissue without metastasis was found to be significantly less than that in tissue accompanied with metastasis. However, the expression of MC3-Ag in colorectal cancer tissue without metastasis was found similar to that in tissue accompanied with metastasis. The results showed that MC3-Ag and MC5-Ag might play important roles in colorectal carcinogenesis and that MC3 and MC5 could be used as a tool for screening colorectal cancer.
