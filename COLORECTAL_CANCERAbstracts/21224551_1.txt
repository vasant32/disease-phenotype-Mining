 PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for liver metastases of colorectal cancer. METHODS: RFA was used to treat 31 tumors (median diameter 1.5 cm, range 0.5-3.9 cm) in 13 patients of liver metastases of colorectal cancer. The median number of tumors treated per patient was 2. 9 (range, 1-10). RESULTS: Two patients had complications; bleeding and liver dysfunction. Four (12.9%) of 31 lesions developed a local recurrence after the treatment. We achieved a local control in 2 (92.6%) of 27 lesions <3.0 cm in diameter. In 4 (30.8%) of 13 patients, new metastases were observed at follow-up. One year survival rate from the initial ablation was 92.3% and 2-year was 46.2%. One year total local recurrence rate from the initial ablation was 55.6%. CONCLUSION: In the case of tumor greater than 3 cm, RF ablation is an effective method to treat hepatic metastases from colorectal carcinoma.
