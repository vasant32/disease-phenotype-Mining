 OBJECTIVE: To study the expression of JAG1 and DLL1 in colorectal cancer and its clinical significance. METHODS: Patients with colorectal cancer were treated in the Center of Colorectal Surgery of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of TCM were collected prospectively and followed up. A tissue microarray was made and expressions of JAG1 and DLL1 were detected by immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: A total of 146 cases with colorectal cancer were included. The differences in JAG1 expression were significant among different tumor differentiation types and the differences in DLL1 expression were significant among different tumor locations(all P<0.05). There were no significant differences in the expression of the two genes and microsatellite instability(MSI)(P>0.05). One hundred and thirty-four (91.8%) cases were followed up and the mean follow-up time was (42.3Â±13.3) months. Tumor-free survival was noticed in 86 patients. The overall survival was 93% at 1 year, 74% in 3 years, and 67% in 5 years. Multivariate analysis showed that long-term survival rate was related to TMN stage, pathology types, MSI status and expression of JAG1. The prognosis of patients with high expression of JAG1 was better than those with low and negative expression(P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The expressions of JAG1 and DLL1 are related to tumor differentiation and tumor location. The expression of JAG1 gene is associated with long-term survival.
