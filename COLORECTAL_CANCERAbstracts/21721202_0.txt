Targeted therapies are relatively new molecules available for the oncologist. These drugs target a specific step of the cellular development and interfere with the intracellular signalization pathways. Amongst all others, EGF- and VEGF-pathways are currently targeted by these selective therapies. Modulating EGF and VEGF significantly improves overall survival and progression-free survival for many advanced or metastatic tumors as colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumors or hepatocellular carcinoma. Targeted therapies have a specific action site, a simple administration mode and are relatively well tolerated. In the future these molecules will probably be used "Ã  la carte" for tumors that appear to be refractory to other drugs.
