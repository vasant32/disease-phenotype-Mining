 PURPOSE: Secreted frizzled related proteins (SFRPs) play important roles in tumor progress through antagonizing Wnt signaling. However, SFRPs has not been systematically studied in colorectal tumors. The primary purpose of the study was to discuss the relationship between the expression of SFRPs and the clinicopathologic features of colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: The mRNA expressions of SFRPs were analyzed in 20 paired CRC and adjacent non-cancerous tissues by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The protein expression of SFRP1 and SFRP4 were verified by Western blot in those 20 paired samples and were further detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in other 206 colorectal tissues. RESULTS: The mRNA levels of SFRP1 and SFRP5 were significantly downregulated in 85 and 80% of CRC, respectively; but SFRP4 was overexpressed in 16 of 20 CRC samples. These findings were concordant with those obtained from the Western blotting in SFRP1 and SFRP4. Moreover, IHC analysis demonstrated increasing SFRP4 expression and decreasing SRFP1 levels in CRC compared with HIN and adenoma. CONCLUSIONS: SFRP1 and SFRP4 appear to be candidate markers for colorectal lesions. Unlike SFRP1 as a negative regulator for CRC carcinogenesis, SFRP4 may play quite different biological role in CRC.
