The occurrence of adenocarcinoma after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis (UC) is an infrequent but potentially lethal complication. Neither histomorphologic nor molecular features of pouch adenocarcinoma after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis have been fully investigated. We report the largest series of 12 pouch and peripouch adenocarcinomas and compared them with 58 randomly selected UC-associated adenocarcinomas. The mean age of patients with pouch/peripouch adenocarcinoma was 55.2 years (SD 14.8), which was not significantly different from that of controls (P=0.52). Pouch/peripouch adenocarcinoma and UC-associated adenocarcinoma had a comparable frequency of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, lack of dirty necrosis, mucin differentiation, signet ring cell differentiation, heterogeneity, and well differentiation (P>0.05 for all). Pouch/peripouch adenocarcinoma was more likely to show Crohn-like reaction compared with UC-associated adenocarcinoma (P=0.047). Loss of at least 1 mismatch repair protein was noted in 9% of pouch/peripouch adenocarcinomas and 9.6% of UC-related adenocarcinomas (P=1.0). There was no significant difference in the frequency of p53 overexpression (36.4% vs. 61.1%, P=0.184) or nuclear immunoreactivity for Î²-catenin (9% vs. 7.4%, P=0.99) in pouch/peripouch versus UC-associated adenocarcinomas, respectively. Pouch/peripouch and UC-associated adenocarcinoma had a comparable positive rate for CK7 (54.5% vs. 55.5%, P=0.99), CK20 (100% vs. 98.1%, P=0.99), and CDX2 (72.8% vs. 72.2%, P=0.99) by immunohistochemistry. In summary, pouch and peripouch adenocarcinoma can occur in patients without colorectal neoplasia and in those with idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease, can be potentially lethal, and has histomorphologic and molecular features similar to those of UC-associated adenocarcinoma.
