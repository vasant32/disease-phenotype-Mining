 OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in DNA repair gene XPD751 is associated with sensitivity and time to progression (TTP) for platinum-containing combination chemotherapy in advanced colorectal carcinoma. METHODS: A total of 98 patients pathologically diagnosed as advanced colorectal cancer were treated with FOLFOX chemotherapy. TheDNA of peripheral blood-leukocytes was obtained before treatment, and XPD genetype was detected by PCR-RFLP analysis. RESULTS: The frequency of XPD751 Lys/lys was 76 cases (77.6%), lys/Gln 17 cases (17.4%), and Gln/Gln genetype 5 cases (5.1%). The effective rate of FOLFOX chemotherapy among patients with XPD751 Lys/lys was 50.0%, lys/Gln 29.4%, and Gln/Gln genetypes 20.0%. The difference between Lys/lys and lys/Gln was statistically significant, Ï‡(2) = 4.04, P < 0.05. The results indicated that the failure of chemotherapy in patients with Lys/Lys genetype was 3.8-fold to those with Lys/Gln, by adjusting of gender, age, and tumor metastasis (OR = 3.800). The MTTP of the 98 patients was 10.1 months. The MTTP was 11.3 months for patients with Lys/Lys genotypes of XPD751 gene and 2.9 months for patients with Lys/Gln and Gln/Gln genotypes of XPD751 gene, the difference between Lys/Lys and at least one Gln was significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Single nucleotide polymorphism of XPD751 correlates with the clinical response to FOLFOX chemotherapy. XPD751 genetic polymorphisms may be associated with TTP of advanced colorectal carcinoma patients treated with oxaliplatin as the first line chemotherapy. XPD751 genotype detected by the PCR-RFLP method may be a predictor of prognosis for FOLFOX chemotherapy.
