Liver metastasis in colorectal cancer is the major cause of cancer related death. To identify and characterize proteins associated with colon cancer metastasis, we have compared the conditioned serum-free medium of highly metastatic KM12SM colorectal cancer cells with the parental, poorly metastatic, KM12C cells using quantitative SILAC analyses on a linear ion trap-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer. In total, 1337 proteins were simultaneously identified in SILAC forward and reverse experiments. For quantification, 1098 proteins were selected in both experiments, with 155 proteins showing >1.5 fold-change. About 52% of these proteins were secreted directly or using alternative secretion pathways. GDF15, S100A8/A9 and SERPINI1 showed capacity to discriminate cancer serum samples from healthy controls using ELISA assays. In silico analyses of deregulated proteins in the secretome of metastatic cells showed a major abundance of proteins involved in cell adhesion, migration and invasion. To characterize the tumorigenic and metastatic properties of some top up- and down-regulated proteins we used siRNA silencing and antibody blocking. Knocking-down expression of NEO1, SERPINI1 and PODXL showed a significant effect on cellular adhesion. Silencing or blocking experiments with SOSTDC1, CTSS, EFNA3, CD137L/TNFSF9, ZG16B and MDK caused a significant decrease in migration and invasion of highly metastatic cells. In addition, silencing of SOSTDC1, EFNA3 and CD137L/TNFSF9 reduced liver colonization capacity of KM12SM cells. Finally, the panel of six proteins involved in invasion showed association to poor prognosis and overall survival after dataset analysis of gene alterations. In summary, we have defined a collection of proteins that are relevant to understand the mechanisms underlying adhesion, migration, invasion and metastasis in colorectal cancer.
