The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of baicalein and             wogonin, which are compounds derived from the Chinese herb Scutellaria baicalensis,             in suppressing the viability of HT-29 human colon cancer cells. Following treatment             with baicalein or wogonin, several apoptotic events were observed, including DNA             fragmentation, chromatin condensation and increased cell cycle arrest in the G1             phase. Baicalein and wogonin decreased Bcl-2 expression, whereas the expression             of Bax was increased in a dose-dependent manner compared with the control. Furthermore,             the induction of apoptosis was accompanied by an inactivation of phosphatidylinositol             3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt in a dose-dependent manner. The administration of baicalein             to mice resulted in the inhibition of the growth of HT-29 xenografts without any             toxicity following 5 weeks of treatment. The results indicated that baicalein             induced apoptosis via Akt activation in a p53-dependent manner in the HT-29 colon             cancer cells and that it may serve as a chemopreventive or therapeutic agent for             HT-29 colon cancer.
