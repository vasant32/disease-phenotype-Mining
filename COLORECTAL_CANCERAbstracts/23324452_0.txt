Background: Insulin, 25-hydroxy vitaminD3 (25(OH)D3) and folate have been differently associated with a risk of colonic neoplasms in the general population. Acromegalic patients have an increased risk of colorectal tumors and an association between fasting insulin concentrations and colonic lesions has been reported. However, it is unknown whether insulin, 25(OH)D3, folate and homocysteine interact to determine the risk of colonic tumors in acromegaly. Aim: To investigate whether serum insulin, 25(OH)D3, folate and homocysteine concentrations were associated with precancerous colonic lesions in acromegalic patients. Material and methods: A cohort of 146 consecutive acromegalic patients was evaluated for colonoscopy findings and fasting insulin, 25(OH)D3, folate and homocysteine levels. A preliminary study was conducted in 9 na√Øve acromegalic patients to evaluate the effect of somatostatin analogues (SSA) on serum levels of those factors. Results: Insulin reduced during SSA whereas the other factors did not change. In the cohort study, colonic lesions[14 adenomas; 32 hyperplastic polyps] were detected in 46 patients. Fasting insulin, 25(OH)D3, folate and homocysteine levels did not differ in patients with or without colonic adenomas. High folate levels were associated with a lower risk of developing precancerous colonic lesions at the multivariate analysis, when corrected by age, gender, disease activity and SSA therapy. Conclusions: Serum insulin, 25(OH)D3 and homocysteine serum concetrantions do not seem to influence the development of precancerous colonic lesions in acromegalic patients, while higher folate levels may be associated with a lower risk of colonic lesions.
