 OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify risk factors of postoperative 30-day mortality (POM) after colorectal cancer resection. SUMMARY: Meta-analyses have failed to demonstrate any significant benefit of laparoscopy in terms of postoperative mortality. This could be explained by the lack of a large sample size. METHODS: All patients who underwent colorectal resection for cancer between 2006 and 2008 in France were included. Data were extracted from the French National Health Service Database. A multivariate analysis evaluating risk factors for POM was performed including the following factors: age, gender, tumor location, associated comorbidities, emergency surgery, synchronous liver metastasis, malnutrition, and surgical approach. RESULTS: During the 3-year period, a total of 84,524 colorectal resections for colorectal cancer were performed: 22,359 through laparoscopy (26%) and 62,165 through laparotomy (74%). From 2006 to 2008, laparoscopic approach rate increased from 23% to 29% (P < 0.001). POM was 5.0%: 2% after laparoscopy and 6% after laparotomy (P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, 7 independent factors were significantly associated with a higher POM: age 70 years or more [P < 0.001, odds ratio (OR): 3.28; (3.00-3.59)], respiratory comorbidity [P < 0.001, OR: 3.16; (2.91-3.37)], vascular comorbidity [P < 0.001, OR: 2.66; (2.48-2.85)], neurologic comorbidity [P < 0.001, OR: 1.78; (1.51-2.09)], emergency surgery [P < 0.001, OR: 2.68; (2.48-2.90)], synchronous liver metastasis [P < 0.001, OR: 2.63; (2.41-2.86)], and preoperative malnutrition [OR: 1.33; (1.19-1.50)]. Laparoscopic surgery [P < 0.001, OR: 0.59; (0.54-0.65)] was independently associated with a significant decreased POM. CONCLUSIONS: This all-inclusive national study showed that POM after colorectal cancer surgery is significantly reduced in case of age less than 70 years, elective surgery, and absence of synchronous liver metastasis, malnutrition, respiratory, neurologic, or vascular comorbidity. Furthermore, it is suggested that a laparoscopic surgery is independently associated with a decreased POM. This result, observed at a national level, must be considered when choosing the best surgical approach for colorectal cancer treatment.
