 BACKGROUND: Lymph node (LN) evaluation is an important factor for the prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). The purpose of our study was to investigate the effectiveness of E74-like factor 3 (ELF3) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as useful markers to detect LN metastases in CRC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the mRNA expression of ELF3 and CEA in LNs and tissues from 22 patients with CRC and in controls with ulcerative colitis (UC) by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, as well as by hematoxylin-eosin staining. RESULTS: ELF3 and CEA expression showed statistically significant differences among four LN groups: LNs from patients with CRC categorized into three Dukes' stages and LNs from patients with UC (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). We found a statistical correlation between the expression levels of both markers in patients with CRC compared with each Dukes' stage. CONCLUSION: ELF3, as a gene marker, may be sufficiently practical to detect LN metastases of CRC, rather than CEA.
