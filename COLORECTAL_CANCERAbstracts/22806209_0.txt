 BACKGROUND: Our aim was to investigate the presence of free cancer cells found in lavage cytology specimens taken from the proximity of tumors during the course of curative open and laparoscopic colorectal resections and then examine and compare the long-term disease outcomes in cases of negative and positive cytology. Based on the results, we were hoping to identify the place of peritumoral lavage cytology among prognostic factors for disease recurrence. METHODS: Between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2007 intraoperative peritoneal lavage cytology was performed in 145 patients who underwent curative colorectal procedures. In all, 37 of the procedures were laparoscopic resections. RESULTS: Malignant cells were detected in the intraoperative peritoneal lavage cytology samples from 25 patients. Median follow-up was 47 months (3-81 months). Among the 25 patients with positive cytology; locoregional recurrence or distant metastasis was found in 14 during this period (56 %), whereas among the 120 patients with negative cytology the incidence was 28 (23 %). CONCLUSIONS: The impact of tumor stage, lymph node status, and peritoneal lavage cytology on recurrence rates is significant. Tumor, nodal, and lavage cytology status can be organized hierarchically in relation to time of recurrence. Cytology is most important, with positivity rendering long-term prognosis unfavorable. When comparing surgical techniques (open versus laparoscopic), we found no significant difference in recurrence rates. Our study has shown that conventional peritoneal lavage cytology is a prognostic factor in the case of patients undergoing curative colorectal operations.
