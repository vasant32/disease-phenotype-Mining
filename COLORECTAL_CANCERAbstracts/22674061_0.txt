Paclitaxel (PTX) is a potent chemotherapy for many cancers but it suffers from very poor solubility. Consequently, the TAXOL formulation uses copious amounts of the surfactant Cremophor EL to solubilize the drug for injection, resulting in severe hypersensitivity and neutropenia. In contrast to Cremophor EL, presented is a way to solubilize PTX by conjugation of a dicarboxylic fatty acid for specific binding to the ubiquitous protein, serum albumin. The conjugation chemistry was simplified to a single step using the activated anhydride form of 3-pentadecylglutaric (PDG) acid, which is reactive to a variety of nucleophiles. The PDG derivative is less cytotoxic than the parent compound and was found to slowly hydrolyze to PTX (â‰ˆ 5% over 72 h) in serum, tumor cytosol, and tumor tissue homogenate. When injected intravenously to tumor-bearing mice, [(3) H]-PTX in the TAXOL formulation was cleared rapidly with a half-life of 7 h. In the case of the PDG derivative of PTX, the drug is quickly distributed and approximately 20% of the injected dose remained in the vasculature experiencing a 23 h half-life. These improvements from modifying PTX with the PDG fatty acid present the opportunity for PDG to become a generic modification for the improvement of many therapeutics.
