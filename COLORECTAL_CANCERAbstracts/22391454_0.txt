Minimal invasive surgery is one of the most challenging advances in the craft of surgery in last 2 decades. In our country the advanced craft has been in practice for more than one and a half decade and some of our committed surgeons have mastered this craft and made an impact not only on national level but also on international level. Many times we may get impressed by watching the masters in the craft but forgetting the efforts the master has put in to reach the Zenith and in a bid to imitate the master we may ignore the awaiting disaster. In this article I will be discussing the overall impact of this surgical craft globally and its various evidence based pros and cons with a particular reference to colorectal surgery to ascertain whether the craft of minimal access with maximal success is a myth or a reality.
