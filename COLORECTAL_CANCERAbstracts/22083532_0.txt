 INTRODUCTION: LFA-1 is an adhesion molecule which belongs to the β2-integrin family. Overexpression of LFA-1 in hepatic natural killer cells has been associated with increased apoptosis of neoplastic cells in colorectal cancer (CRC); moreover, studies in CRC have linked LFA-1 overexpression in neoplastic cells with vascular intrusion through adhesion to endothelial cells, thus implying a possible role in creation of metastases. AIMS AND METHODS: We studied the expression of LFA-1 in a series of 82 patients with CRC. A standard three-step immunohistochemical analysis was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. An IgG2a anti-CD11a monoclonal antibody was used. Cases were characterized according to clinicopathological variables including sex, age, tumor localization, size, grade, Dukes stage, wall invasion, and presence of metastatic lymph nodes (mLNs) or distal metastases. RESULTS: LFA-1 was expressed at the primary tumor site in 51 cases and 6/33 cases with metastatic lymphnodes. In Dukes D cases (n = 4), only one case was LFA-1(+). LFA-1 expression at the primary tumor site was associated with the absence of metastatic disease and with Dukes B stage. However, in those cases with LFA-1 expression in cancer cells in mLNs, this was associated with its expression at the primary tumor site. CONCLUSION: The positive association of LFA-1 expression in mLNs when the primary tumor site is also LFA-1(+) could imply an adaptation advantage of this specific cellular clone to its micro-environment, predisposing it to creation of mLNs, pointing to a role for LFA-1 in creation of mLNs in CRC.
