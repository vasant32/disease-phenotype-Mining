MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs exhibiting critical functions as post-transcriptional regulators. Due to the importance and extensive influence of miRNAs on genes, dysregulation of miRNAs has been associated with various types of cancer, with more prominent being colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Increasing evidence suggests that miRNAs mediate the initiation and development of CRC and also act as potential biomarkers for both diagnosis and prognosis. In this review, we summarize the recent advancement of miRNA research in CRC, in particular, the miRNAs which interact with critical pathways such as p53, NF-kappa B, beta-catenin pathways and also play a significant role in the regulation of EMT and maintenance of cancer stem cell.
