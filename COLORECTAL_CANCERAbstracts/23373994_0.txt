The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of expression level of α5β1-integrin and MMP-14 with clinicopathologic features and prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC). The expressions of α5β1-integrin and MMP-14 in normal colorectal mucosa and CRC tissue were detected with immunohistochemistry. We estimated the five-year survival rate by the Kaplan-Meier method. The positive expressions rates of α5β1-integrin and MMP-14 in CRC tissue were 60.6% and 63.3% respectively, and there were significant differences on their positive expression rates between in CRC tissue and in normal colorectal mucosa(P<0.05). The expression rates of α5β1-integrin and MMP-14 in patients with poor histological differentiation, lymph node metastasis and high clinical staging were heightened. There was a significant difference (P<0.05) on the five-year survival rate for α5β1-integrin expression, which was 44.6% in positive groups and 75.5% in negative groups. And there was a significant difference (P<0.05) on the five-year survival rate for MMP-14 expression, which was 48.2% in positive group and 73.1% in negative group. The expression of α5β1-integrin and MMP-14 is correlated with the progression and metastasis of CRC, and α5β1-integrin and MMP-14 may be used as prognostic markers in CRC.
