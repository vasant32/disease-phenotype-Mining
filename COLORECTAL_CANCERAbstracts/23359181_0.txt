PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of the combination of panitumumab and irinotecan every 3 weeks in a phase II trial as second-line treatment in patients with advanced wild-type (WT) K-RAS colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: Fifty-three patients received 9 mg/kg of panitumumab followed by 350 mg/m(2) of irinotecan every 21 days until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or consent withdrawal. RESULTS: Median age of patients included was 67 years. All patients had previously received 5-fluorouracil, 84 % oxaliplatin and 8 % irinotecan as first-line treatment. Patients received a median of five infusions of panitumumab and irinotecan. On an intention-to-treat analysis, 12 patients (23 %) achieved partial responses and 22 patients (41 %) achieved disease stabilization. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 4.5 and 15.1 months, respectively. The most frequent treatment-related severe toxicities per patient were diarrhoea (35.8 %), followed by skin rash (32.1 %), asthenia (18.9 %) and neutropenia (13.2 %). A significant association between clinical response and incidence and grade of skin toxicity was observed (p = 0.0032). CONCLUSION: This study shows that the administration of panitumumab plus irinotecan every 3 weeks is safe, active and feasible as second-line treatment in patients with advanced WT K-RAS CRC.
