Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most frequent cancer in men and the             third most common cancer in women in Korea. In spite of the significant advances             in conventional therapeutic approaches to CRC, most patients ultimately die of             their disease. There is a need to develop novel preventive approaches for this             malignancy. This study was carried out to investigate the anticancer effect of             the diastereoisomeric compounds, MHY-449 and MHY-450, novel dihydrobenzofuro[4,5-b][1,8]naphthyridin-6-one             derivatives, on HCT116 human colon cancer cells. MHY-449 exhibited more potent             cytotoxicity than MHY-450, against HCT116 cells. Treatment of cells with MHY-449             resulted in growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in a concentration-dependent             manner, and inhibition of proliferation in a time-dependent manner. The induction             of apoptosis was observed by decreased cell viability, DNA fragmentation, activation             of protein levels involved in death receptors. Moreover, activation of caspase-3,             -8 and -9 and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and alteration in the ratio             of Bax/Bcl-2 protein expression was observed. MHY-449 induced G2/M phase arrest             in the cell cycle progression which was observed by flow cytometry analysis, and             a decrease in the protein expression of cyclinÂ B1 and its activating partners             Cdc25c and Cdc2. MHY-449 also caused increase in the expression levels of p53,             a tumor suppressor gene, and p21WAF1/CIP and p27KIP, G2/M phase inhibitors. These             results suggest that MHY-449 may be a useful candidate for chemo-prevention and/or             treatment of colon cancer.
