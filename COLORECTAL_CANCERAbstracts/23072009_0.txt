As the evidence-based medicine of gastrointestinal laparoscopy (GIL) for gastrointestinal cancer accumulated, the procedures have become a "should be done" treatment, not a "can be done" ones, for early or median gastric or colorectal cancer. So, we propose that GIL for cancer should be indicationization, rather than doctorization. The former is that the procedures should be performed according to indication of the gastrointestinal tumors, and the latter is that the different procedures applied depend on the doctor's experience. For indicationization of GIL, special training program is suggested and format or standardization of GIL for cancer should be abstracted.
