Tumor immune tolerance plays a critical role in tumor cell survival; the establishment of tumor immune tolerance is incompletely understood yet. Integrin alphavbeta6 (avb6) is involved in tumor growth and metastasis. This study aimed to observe the effect of avb6 on the development of tumor tolerance in colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, 28 CRC patients were recruited. The frequencies of tolerogenic dendritic cells (TolDC), regulatory T cells (Treg), and CD8+ T cells in surgically removed CRC tissue were assessed by flow cytometry. The levels of avb6 in CRC tissue were measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). The effect of avb6 on inducing TolDCs and Tregs was evaluated with the cell culture model. The results showed that in surgically removed CRC tissue, we detected higher frequencies of TolDC and Tregs, lower frequency CD8+ T cells and high levels of avb6 as compared with non-CRC tissue. CRC protein extracts could induce TolDC development that could be blocked by anti-avb6 antibody. CRC-derived DCs could convert na√Øve CD4+ T cells to Tregs. Peripheral CD8+ T cells from CRC patients still retained the ability to produce granzyme B and to proliferate in response to CRC tumor antigen in culture that was abolished by the presence of CRC-derived Tregs. We conclude that CRC-derived avb6 is involved in the establishment of tumor immune tolerance in local tissues.
