FOLFOX or FOLFIRI are commonly used as first- or second-line chemotherapy for unresectable colorectal cancer or its metastases.Recently, it had become a trend to add bevacizumab or cetuximab(Cmab)limited to the K-ras wild-type or panitumumab(Pmab)limited to the K-ras wild-type.At the present time, a common third-line chemotherapy is CPT-11 plus Cmab limited to the K-ras wild-type, or Cmab/Pmab.However, the results are unsatisfactory.With Cmab plus S-1 we treated a case of remnant liver metastases from rectal cancer which was a K-ras wild-type, after treating 5-FU, L-OHP and CPT-11. The tumor marker dropped and 7 focuses of liver metastases disappeared after 6 courses of treatment(complete response: CR in)and CR was achieved after 9 courses treatment.After 10 courses of treatment, a new lesion appeared on S5 of the liver and we performed percutaneous radiofrequency ablation.
