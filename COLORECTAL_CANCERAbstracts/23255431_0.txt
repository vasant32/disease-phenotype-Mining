Colorectal cancer (CRC) arises from the normal colon epithelium through the accumulation of genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations that are associated with progression along the histological adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence. Elucidating the molecular alterations underlying disease progression will not only provide insight into the behavior of the tumors, but also could lead to the discovery of useful biomarkers for diagnosis, monitoring treatment responsiveness, or predicting disease outcomes. In the past a few years, there have been several evaluating differentially expressed protein biomarkers by employing proteomics technologies coupled with mass spectrometry. In the current review, we will briefly summarize the results from selected recent studies using tissue or serum samples from CRC patients in the past 5 years and discuss the opportunities and challenges in translating these findings from the research setting to clinical practice.
