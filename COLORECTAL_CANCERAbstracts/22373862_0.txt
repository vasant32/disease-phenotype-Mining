 BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with an increased risk of colon cancer. High-fat diets that lead to obesity may be a contributing factor, but the mechanisms are unknown. AIMS: This study examines susceptibility to azoxymethane (AOM)-induced precancerous lesions in mice in response to consumption of either a low or a high-fat diet and associated molecular changes in the liver and colon. METHODS: Gene markers of xenobiotic metabolism, leptin-regulated inflammatory cytokines and proliferation were assessed in liver and colon in response to high-fat feeding to determine links with increased sensitivity to AOM. RESULTS: High-fat feeding increased development of AOM-induced precancerous lesions and was associated with increased CYP2E1 gene expression in the liver, but not the colon. Leptin receptors and the colon stem cell marker (Lgr5) were down-regulated in the proximal colon, with a corresponding up-regulation of the inflammatory cytokine (IL6) in response to high-fat feeding. Notably in the distal colon, where aberrant crypt foci develop in response to AOM, the proliferative stem cell marker, Lgr5, was significantly up-regulated with high-fat feeding. CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides evidence that high-fat diets can alter regulation of molecular markers of xenobiotic metabolism that may expose the colon to carcinogens, in parallel with activation of Î²-catenin-regulated targets regulating colon epithelial cells. High-fat diets associated with obesity may alter multiple molecular factors that act synergistically to increase the risk of colon cancer associated with obesity.
