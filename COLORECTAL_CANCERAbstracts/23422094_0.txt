PURPOSE: O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA repair protein removing mutagenic and cytotoxic adducts from O6-guanine in DNA. Approximately 40% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) display MGMT deficiency due to promoter hypermethylation leading to silencing of the gene. Alkylating agents, such as dacarbazine, exert their antitumor activity by DNA methylation at the O6-guanine site, inducing base pair mismatch, therefore activity of dacarbazine could be enhanced in CRCs lacking MGMT. We conducted a phase II study with dacarbazine in CRCs who had failed standard therapies (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, fluoropyrimidines, and cetuximab or panitumumab if KRAS wild type). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: All patients had tumor tissue assessed for MGMT as promoter hypermethylation in double-blind for treatment outcome. Patients received dacarbazine 250 mg/m2 i.v. qd for 4 consecutive days q21 until PD or intolerable toxicity. We employed a Simon two-stage design to determinate if the ORR would be â‰¥ 10%. Secondary endpoints included association of response, PFS and disease control rate with MGMT status. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were enrolled from May 2011 to March 2012. Patients received a median of 3 cycles of dacarbazine [range 1-12]. Grade 3-4 toxicities included: fatigue (41%), nausea/vomiting (29%), constipation (25%), platelet count decrease (19%), anemia (18%). Overall, 2 patients (3%) achieved partial response (PR) and 8 patients (12%) had stable disease (SD). Disease control rate (PR+SD) was significantly associated with MGMT promoter hypermethylation in the corresponding tumors. CONCLUSION: Objective clinical responses to dacarbazine in metastatic CRC patients are confined to those tumors harbouring epigenetic inactivation of the DNA repair enzyme MGMT.
