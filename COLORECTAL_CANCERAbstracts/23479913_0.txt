 BACKGROUND: After introducing "BOKUTOH enhanced recvery after surgery (ERAS)" protocol for colorectal surgery in our hospital, the hospital stay after surgery was reduced from 10 days to 7. However, the patients' quality of life (QOL) throughout the perioperative period was not quantified. We assessed the QOL of these patients by using QoR-40J and SF-36v2J (Japanese versions of QoR-40 and SF-36v2) questionnaires. METHODS: Twenty-seven colorectal cancer patients undergoing surgery and "BOKUTOH ERAS" protocol management were asked to answer both QoR-40 J and SF-36v2J questionnaires pre- and post-operatively. The scores were evaluated by using Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: From preoperative score (183.5), the scores of QoR-40 J differed significantly on post-operating day (POD) 1 and POD3 (150.9 [15.7] and 168.1 [17.5] points, respectively). Before leaving the hospital (POD6) and after one month from surgery, both QoR40 J and SF-36v2J scores were similar to preoperative ones. CONCLUSIONS: Under "BOKUTOH ERAS" protocol management, patients who had had colorectal surgery were able to recover their QOL within 6 days. Thus, leaving hospital by 7 days after surgery was appropriate to our patients.
