A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) is a key factor involved in the             tumor development and progression in some tumor tissues and cells. Its overexpression             and as gene target in SW480 colon carcinoma cells was confirmed in our previous             study. To seek a more potent way to treat colon carcinoma using a gene therapy             method, herein, we constructed a multiple short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression             vector containing four shRNAs against the APRIL gene in SW480 cells. APRIL expression             levels and cell biological behavior were detected after transfection with different             kinds of vectors. As expected, we found that our multiple shRNA vector produced             a more significant knockdown effect of APRIL than the vectors containing only             one APRIL shRNA. Furthermore, our findings indicate that silencing APRIL expression             in SW480 cells decreased their malignancy by reducing proliferation, invasion             and adhesion, as well as inducing apoptosis. Based on our findings, vectors containing             multiple shRNAs to silence the expression of APRIL may be exploited as a novel             therapeutic strategy for tumors.
