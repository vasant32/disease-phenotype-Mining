 BACKGROUND: Statins and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with reduced risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in some studies. The objective of this study was to quantify the relative risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as a risk factor for CRC and to estimate whether this risk may be modified by long-term use of NSAIDs or statins. METHODS: The Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer study is a population-based, case-control study of incident colorectal cancer in northern Israel and controls matched by age, sex, clinic, and ethnicity. Personal histories of IBD and medication use were measured by structured, in-person interview. The relative risk of IBD and effect modification by statins and NSAIDs were quantified by conditional and unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 1921 matched pairs of CRC cases and controls, a self-reported history of IBD was associated with a 1.9-fold increased risk of CRC (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-3.26). Long-term statin use was associated with a reduced risk of both IBD-associated CRC (odds ratio [OR] = 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01-0.78) and non-IBD CRC (OR = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.39-0.62). Stratified analysis suggested that statins may be more protective among those with IBD (ratio of OR = 0.14; 95% CI, 0.01-1.31; P = .51), although not statistically significant. NSAID use in patients with a history of IBD was suggestive of reduced risk of CRC but did not reach statistical significance (OR = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.12-1.86). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of CRC was elevated 1.9-fold in patients with IBD. Long-term statin use was associated with reduced risk of CRC in patients with IBD.
