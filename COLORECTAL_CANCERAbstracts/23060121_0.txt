Colorectal micropapillary carcinoma has recently been reported as an aggressive variant of adenocarcinoma with a high incidence of lymph node metastasis, but has not been well investigated in terms of survival analysis. This study analyzed the clinicopathological characteristics, including survival data, of the patients with micropapillary carcinoma. We hypothesized that the aggressive features of micropapillary carcinoma might be related to the presence of more tumor cells with stem cell phenotype in colorectal cancer. Fifty-five (10%) micropapillary carcinoma cases were identified among 561 cases of colorectal cancer. We compared the clinicopathological characteristics, including survival data and immunohistochemical profiles of stem cell markers (SOX2, NOTCH3, CD44v6, CD166, ALDH1) of micropapillary carcinomas with those of randomly selected 112 conventional adenocarcinomas lacking micropapillary carcinoma components (non-micropapillary carcinoma) in the colorectum. To exclude the possibility of dilution of control group by patients with microsatellite instability-high carcinomas, we divided non-micropapillary carcinomas into microsatellite instability-high carcinoma and microsatellite stable tumors. Micropapillary carcinomas were characterized by more frequent lymphovascular invasion (P<0.0001) and lymph node metastasis (P<0.0001), higher pathological T and tumor node metastasis stages (P=0.047 and P=0.001), and more frequent SOX2 (P=0.038) and NOTCH3 expressions (P=0.005). Overall 5-year survival rate for patients with micropapillary carcinoma (37%) was significantly lower than for microsatellite instability-high carcinoma and microsatellite stable carcinoma patients (92 and 72%, P<0.0001). The presence of the micropapillary carcinoma component was shown to be associated with a significantly worse survival rate in univariate (P<0.0001) and multivariate (P=0.003, Cox hazard ratio 2.402) analyses. In conclusion, recognition of the micropapillary carcinoma component in colonic adenocarcinoma is very important, because the micropapillary carcinoma has been associated with a significantly worse prognosis. We also found a higher expression rate of cancer stem cell markers in micropapillary carcinomas, suggesting their potential contribution to the survival disadvantage of micropapillary carcinoma.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 12 October 2012; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2012.163.
