Hypermethylation of the promoter region of the p16INK4a (p16) gene plays             a significant role in the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC).             The aim of the present study was to establish the role of the methylation status             of the p16 gene in 114 CRC cases and to correlate it with the various clinicopathological             parameters. Analysis of p16 promoter methylation was performed by methylation-specific             PCR. Forty-eight (42.1%) of the CRC cases were found to be methylated for the             p16 gene in our population. The methylation status was found to be associated             with the gender, lymph node status, tumour stage, smoking status and tumour grade             of the CRC patients. p16 plays a pivotal role in tumour development and progression             to advanced stages.
