BACKGROUND: The addition of bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy has significant clinical benefits in metastatic colorectal cancer. However, its use is often avoided due to patient condition or disease status. METHODS: Of 228 consecutive patients receiving first-line FOLFOX-based regimens from June 2007 to June 2009, 96 patients (42 %) received FOLFOX alone without bevacizumab. We retrospectively examined the reasons why bevacizumab was not combined with FOLFOX. RESULTS: Among 96 patients for whom the addition of bevacizumab was avoided, 73 patients (76 %) had bevacizumab-related contraindications including hypertension, proteinuria, bleeding, thromboembolic events, wound-healing complications and gastrointestinal perforation. Other avoidance reasons were conditions precluding the use of bevacizumab in 15 patients (16 %), economic problems and anxiety about adverse events in 8 patients (8 %), and unknown reasons in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Bevacizumab-related contraindications were the main reason for drug avoidance, though economic problems and anxiety about rare but serious adverse events were also factors for avoidance of bevacizumab.
