 INTRODUCTION: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has an emerging role in patients affected with pulmonary metastases. Purpose of this study was to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of SBRT in a cohort of patients treated between 2003 and 2009 at our institution. METHODS: A total of 61 patients with oligometastatic lung tumors (single pulmonary nodules in 73.7%) were included in the study. SBRT was performed with a stereotactic body frame and a 3D-conformal technique. Fifty-one patients received 26 Gy in 1 fraction, 22 a dose of 45 Gy in 3 fractions and 3 a dose of 36 Gy in 4 fractions. Primary tumor was lung cancer in 45.7% of patients, colorectal cancer in 21.3% and a variety of other origins in 33%. The primary endpoint was local control, secondary endpoints were survival and toxicity. RESULTS: After a median follow-up interval of 20.4 months, local control rates at 2 and 3 years were 89% and 83.5%, overall survival 66.5% and 52.5%, cancer-specific survival 75.4% and 67%, progression-free survival 32.4% and 22.3%. Tumor volume was significantly associated to survival, with highest rates in patients with single small tumors. Median survival time was 42.8 months, while median progression-free survival time was 11.9 months. Toxicity profiles were good, with just one case of grade III toxicity (pneumonitis). CONCLUSION: This study shows that SBRT is an effective and safe local treatment option for patients with lung metastases. Definitive results are strictly correlated to clinical selection of patients.
