Epidemiological studies found inconsistent results on the association of two variants on TGFBR1 (TGFBR1*6A and Int7G24A) with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. The present study was aimed to evaluate the association of these two variants with CRC susceptibility via the meta-analysis methods. For variant TGFBR1*6A, nine reports including 6,765 CRC patients and 8,496 unrelated controls were identified. The heterozygotes *6A/*9A showed a significant increased risk of CRC with the pooled OR was 1.12 (95% CI = 1.02-1.23), and the pooled OR for the homozygotes *6A/*6A was 1.13 (95% CI = 0.80-1.58) compared to the homozygotes *9A/*9A. However, under the dominant effect model, the TGFBR1*6A carriers showed a significantly increased CRC risk (pooled OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.03-1.23, *6A/*6A and *6A/*9A vs. *9A/*9A). For variant Int7G24A, three case-control studies with 1,074 cases and 1,945 controls were found. Although no significant association was found for heterozygosity Int7G24A carriers with CRC risk (pooled OR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.67-1.42), the homozygosity A/A carriers showed a significant elevated risk of CRC (pooled OR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.14-2.47) compared to G/G homozygotes. Under the recessive effect model, homozygotes A/A showed a 71% increase of CRC risk compared to the A/G and G/G genotype carriers (pooled OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.17-2.51). These data strongly suggested that the two polymorphisms of TGFBR1 may confer low-penetrance susceptibility of CRC risk.
