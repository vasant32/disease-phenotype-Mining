 OBJECTIVE: To observe the affect of Small interfering RNA Rac1b (Si-Rac1b) on the malignant biological behaviors of colorectal cancer cell including the proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis of the cells. METHODS: Mediated by lipofectamine 2000, Si-Rac1b was transfected into colorectal cancer cell line SW1116 (with overexpression of Rac1b). The expression of Rac1b was detected by Western blotting and RT-PCR. The CCK-8 assay was used to analyze the cell proliferation, the Wound-healing assay and invasion assay were respectively applied to analyze the cell migration and invasion, and the Hoechst 33258 was used to evaluate the apoptotic index. RESULTS: Si-Rac1b can knock down the Rac1b but not Rac1 both in the level of mRNA and protein. In addition, Si-Rac1b could singnificantly facilitate the cell proliferation, migration, invasion and control the cell apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Si-Rac1b could partically reverse the malignant phenotypes of colorectal cancer cell.
