CD44 standard isoform (CD44s) is a cancer stem cell marker in many tumors,             and is one of the CD44 isoforms.CD44v6 has been reported to correlate with tumor             progression and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer. However, the relevance of             CD44s and CD44v6 to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) remains unclear. Immunohistochemistry             was performed to investigate the clinical importance of CD44s and CD44v6 and their             relevance to EMT in 113 patients with stage II/III colorectal cancer treated by             curative resection. The relevance of CD44v6 knockdown to the phenotype of colon             cancer cells was examined using small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for CD44v6             in vitro. CD44v6 expression showed a significant inverse correlation with E-cadherin             expression (P=0.0007) and a positive correlation with vimentin expression (P=0.0096).             A multivariate analysis showed that high CD44v6 expression was an independent             poor prognostic factor for disease-free survival (P=0.01, HR=3.05) and overall             survival (P=0.025, HR=3.16). The clinical significance and the relevance of CD44s             expression to EMT markers was noted to a lesser extent compared to CD44v6 expression.             The knockdown of CD44v6 decreased vimentin expression, cell invasion and HGF-induced             cell migration, but conferred only a slight effect on E-cadherin expression in             colon cancer cells (HCT116 and LoVo). CD44v6 is related to poor outcome of patients             with colorectal cancer via upregulation of the mesenchymal phenotype.
