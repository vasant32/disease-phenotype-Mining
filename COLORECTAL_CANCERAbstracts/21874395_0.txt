 BACKGROUND: Negative cancer-related intrusive thoughts reduce the benefit of relationship quality on the psychological adjustment of cancer patients. Little is known about the role of perceived control over cancer-related problems in the association between relationship quality and adjustment. PURPOSE: This study examined whether perceived personal control (i.e., on one's own) and collective control (i.e., collaboration with family/friends) mediate the associations between relationship quality and psychological outcomes. METHODS: Chinese colorectal cancer patients (n = 234) were assessed at diagnosis (T1) and at 3- (T2) and 12-month (T3) follow-ups. RESULTS: T2 collective control mediated the association between T1 family relationship quality and T3 satisfaction with life. The negative association between T1 family relationship quality and T3 depression was independent of T2 personal/collective control. CONCLUSIONS: Collective control mediates the relationship between family relationship quality and satisfaction with life, suggesting the need for interventions to enhance relationship quality and perceived control among newly diagnosed cancer patients.
