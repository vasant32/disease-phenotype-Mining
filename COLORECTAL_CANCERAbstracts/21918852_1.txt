 BACKGROUND: Compared with whites, Hispanics have lower incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine whether asymptomatic Hispanics undergoing colonoscopy screening also have lower age-adjusted incidence of polyps ≥ 10 mm. Such data could be used to formulate future screening guidelines. AIMS: The objectives of this study were to measure and analyze the prevalence and location of polyps sized ≥ 10 mm in asymptomatic white and Hispanic patients who received colonoscopy screening. METHODS: Colonoscopy data were prospectively collected from the Clinical Outcomes Research Initiative database, which includes data from a consortium of 66 adult gastrointestinal practice sites in the United States. Asymptomatic white (n = 146,798) and Hispanic (n = 7,654) patients who received colonoscopy screening from 2004 to 2007 were identified. The prevalence of any polyps ≥ 10 mm and of proximal polyps ≥ 10 mm was adjusted for age, sex, practice site type, and family history of colorectal cancer in a multivariate analysis. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between prevalence of polyps ≥ 10 mm in Hispanic and white patients (5.8% vs. 6.2%; P = 0.11; adjusted OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.85-1.03). There was also no significant difference between prevalence of proximal polyps ≥ 10 mm in Hispanics and whites (adjusted OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.87-1.27). CONCLUSION: Despite lower incidence of colorectal cancer, the risk of polyps ≥ 10 mm for Hispanic patients undergoing colonoscopy screening is similar to that for whites. These data emphasize the importance of encouraging timely colorectal cancer screening in Hispanics. Our findings support the application of similar recommendations for colorectal cancer screening of Hispanics and whites.
