 PURPOSE: Metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC) remains a significant public health concern. The objectives of present study are to investigate the efficacy and safety profile of capecitabine-based chemotherapy in the treatment of MCRC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a computerized search using combinations of the following keywords: "metastatic colorectal cancer," "Xeloda," "chemotherapy," "capecitabine," or "5-fluorouracil." RESULTS: Treatment with capecitabine chemotherapy was associated with a significantly prolonged progression-free survival (WMD = 1.24; 95% CI, 0.04-2.44; P = 0.04), whereas overall survival was not statistically significant (WMD [random] = 0.29; P = 0.75). Patients in both capecitabine and 5-fluorouracil groups had equal 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival (OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.59-1.12, P = 0.21; OR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.61-1.15, P = 0.27; OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 0.78-2.05, P = 0.34; respectively). The analysis also demonstrates that the response rate of capecitabine-based chemotherapy was comparable to 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (OR = 1.02, 95% CI, 0.90-1.14; P = 0.80). When comparing single-agent capecitabine against 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, our results showed an overall OR of 1.56 (95% CI, 1.16-2.09) in favor of the capecitabine arm. When toxicity was evaluated, a statistically significant benefit with capecitabine-based therapy was seen, especially for grade 3/4 neutropenia (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.71-0.91; P = 0.00005). CONCLUSIONS: Capecitabine-based chemotherapy demonstrated a significantly superior progression-free survival, equivalent overall survival, and comparable response rate with 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. These observations support the use of capecitabine-based chemotherapy in the treatment of MCRC as a first-line or as a neoadjuvant modality.
