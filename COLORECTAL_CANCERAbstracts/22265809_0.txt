 BACKGROUND: The Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enUmeration of Mortality and morbidity model, and its Portsmouth and colorectal modifications are used to predict postoperative mortality and morbidity after colorectal surgery. AIMS: To compare stent placement as a bridge to surgery vs. emergency surgical resection in patients with acute left-sided colorectal cancer obstruction using P-POSSUM and CR-POSSUM. METHODS: From January 2008 to December 2009, the physiological and operative scores, morbidity and mortality predicted by the P-POSSUM and CR-POSSUM scores were collected in all consecutive patients with LCCO who underwent surgical resection directly (Group A) or after stent placement (Group B). RESULTS: Eighty-six patients were enrolled (Group A-41 and Group B-45). The observed 30-day mortality rate was 9.8% (4/41) in Group A and 2.4% (1/45) in Group B. The 30-day morbidity rate was 61% (25/41) in Group A and 29% (13/45) in Group B. The mean values of P-POSSUM morbidity (A=70.5% vs. B=34.3%; p=0.001), P-POSSUM mortality (A=13.6% vs. B=2.4%; p=0.001) and CR-POSSUM mortality (A=15.1% vs. B=4.9%; p=0.001) were significantly lower in the Group B patients than in the Group A patients. CONCLUSIONS: Bridge to surgery strategy reduces the surgical risks in LCCO, and P-POSSUM and CR-POSSUM scores represent a good tool for comparing the two strategies.
