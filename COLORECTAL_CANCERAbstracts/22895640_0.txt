Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of cancer-related mortality in             the world. Recently, a number of studies have demonstrated that cancer stem cells             (CSCs) present in colorectal cancer tissues, are responsible for resistance to             conventional therapies. Therefore, effective recognition of CSCs is of great importance.             In the present study, to explore the potential characterizations of CSCs by the             expression of specific cell surface markers such as CD133 and CD44, we screened             six CRC cell lines using western blotting, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry.             SW620, one of the six cell lines analyzed, was sorted into four subpopulations             by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). The capability of colony formation,             proliferation rate, apoptosis, drug resistance, as well as their migratory and             invasion potential were detected. The results revealed that the combination of             CD44 and CD133 correlates with the features of CSCs in SW620 cells. CD44 positive             cells showed more robust colony formation, higher proliferation, less spontaneous             apoptosis, a higher resistance to drug-induced cell death, and were enriched after             drug treatment. Among CD44 positive SW620 cells, the CD133 negative subpopulation             was more migratory and invasive, which means that CD44+CD133- correlates with             most of features proposed for CSCs. Overall, the data presented herein showed             that CRCs have a wide range of expression for CD44 and CD133; it is unlikely the             CSCs can be characterized by any single marker or the same set of markers for             all colon cancer cells. For SW620 cells, the CSCs are likely represented by the             CD44+CD133- surface marker. This finding of CSC markers represented by one positive             and one negative is in line with CSCs in other tumors, such as CD34+CD38- for             acute myeloid leukemia; CD44+CD24- for breast and pancreatic tumors. The absence             of surface molecule(s) on CSCs will make it even more difficult to track and target             this group of minority cells.
