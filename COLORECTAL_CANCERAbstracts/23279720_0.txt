AIM: The objective of this economic evaluation, which was based on patients from two randomized controlled clinical trials (NO16966 and NO16967), was to compare direct medical costs to the Australian health-care system of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) and bolus and/or infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) plus folinic acid combined with oxaliplatin (modified [m] FOLFOX-6) in first-line and second-line treatment of advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). METHODS: Direct medical costs were estimated for five treatment settings from a public and private hospital. The costs included in evaluation were for drug acquisition, preparation (oxaliplatin, bolus and infusional 5-FU), administration and wastage. The cost of drug acquisition was calculated based on dosage data and the mean number of treatment cycles from the pivotal studies NO16966 and NO16967. There were no costs associated with preparing capecitabine and leucovorin. An oncology grouping and costing study was performed to determine the relevant administration costs associated with central venous access devices, their placement, maintenance and removal (for oxaliplatin administration) and the continuous infusion of 5-FU via a continuous ambulatory delivery device pump or infuser. RESULTS: This economic evaluation has shown that treating mCRC patients with XELOX in the first and second-line settings results in average cost savings of $9110 and $7113, respectively, compared with mFOLFOX-6. A multi-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the use of XELOX remained cost-saving from an Australian government health budget perspective. CONCLUSION: The use of XELOX, compared with mFOLFOX-6, for the treatment of mCRC is cost-saving in the Australian government health budget.
