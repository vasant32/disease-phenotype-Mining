This study examined (a) differences in rates of initiating colorectal cancer screening across age groups, and (b) factors associated with initiation of colorectal cancer screening among persons age 50-75. Data from 1,699 adults age 50-75 were analyzed from a random sample of households in an eight-county region surrounding the Brazos Valley in Texas. Bivariate descriptive analyses were performed. Logistic regression was employed to assess relationships between demographic, health status, and healthcare utilization variables and having initiated colorectal cancer examination. Having more than a high school education (OR = 1.48, p = 0.002), having insurance (OR = 1.76, p = 0.007), being obese (OR = 1.58, p = 0.015), and having a routine health check-up within the past 2 years (OR = 3.39, p < 0.001) were associated with an increased likelihood of having a colorectal cancer examination. The findings suggest that routine interactions with health care providers may encourage persons to initiate colorectal cancer screening according to guidelines.
