In the past 3 years colorectal cancer became the second cause death (after the broncho-pulmonary cancer) exceeding gastric cancer by 4150 deaths in 2002 (19,05 per hundred thousand inhabitants) and 4860 deaths in 2006. Material and methods: 644 of the 18,978 patients coloscopically investigated at the lasi Gastroenterology and Hepatology Institute in the interval 2000-2007 in which pathology results revealed colorectal cancer, and 279 patients operated at the First Clinic Surgery of the Iasi "Sf. Spiridon" Hospital during 2008-2010 were selected for this study. Results: Colorectal carcinoma has a high incidence in the patients over 60 years. Sex distribution of the tumors showed that this disease most commonly affects males. The male/female ratio was 1.3. In less than 3% of the cases the disease occurred at ages under 40 years. The most frequent clinical manifestations were intestinal transit disorder (97%), pain syndrome on the left side of the abdomen (82.82%), and progressive severe constipation (67.89%). 24.07% of the colorectal cancer cases were located at the level of the proximal colon (cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon and splenic flexure), while 75.9% were located at the distal level. The most frequent macroscopic form was the vegetative one (89.91%).
