Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In this study, recombinant analgesic-antitumor peptide (rAGAP), a protein consisting of small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) linked with a hexa-histidine tag, was used as an antitumor analgesic peptide. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the antitumor activity of rAGAP in human colon adenocarcinoma SW480 cells and its potential molecular mechanisms of action. In this study, cell viability and apoptosis of rAGAP-treated SW480 cells was evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, flow cytometry and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. Western blotting was used to investigate the effects of rAGAP on p27, Bcl-2/Bax and PTEN/PI3K/Akt cellular signal transduction. Our results showed that rAGAP not only enhanced apoptosis, but also inhibited the proliferation of SW480 cells. rAGAP upregulates the expression of p27 in SW480 cells and leads to cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. Furthermore, rAGAP significantly increases the production of Bax and PTEN and suppresses the activation of Bcl-2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and phospho-Akt (p-Akt) in SW480 cells. These results suggest that rAGAP may be a potential new anti-colorectal cancer drug.
