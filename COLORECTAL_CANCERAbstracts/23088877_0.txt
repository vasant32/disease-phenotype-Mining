Owing to encouraging results achieved in the clinical practice, CT colonography (CTC) is being increasingly employed for the examination of the whole colon and rectum and is quickly becoming a widely accepted diagnostic technique that is replacing double contrast barium enema and appears a promising tool for colorectal cancer screening as well. The increasing number of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients undergoing CTC for both evaluation of symptoms and colorectal cancer screening, along with the growing availability of CTC facilities in most healthcare departments and imaging centres, requires that a sufficient number of radiologists be adequately trained in performing and interpreting CTC studies. Indeed, optimal performance of CTC depends on a number of factors, including the quality of colonic preparation (e.g. laxative bowel cleansing and optimised colonic distension), the CTC image acquisition protocol used, and reading approach and specific skills of radiologists for correct detection and interpretation of colonic findings. Consequently, dedicated training and expertise is key to obtain high sensitivity in lesion detection and reduce the number of false positives, thus ensuring an optimal clinical management of patients. To this purpose, dedicated training programmes are essential to teach and standardise not only the approach to CTC reading, but also reporting of colonic findings.
