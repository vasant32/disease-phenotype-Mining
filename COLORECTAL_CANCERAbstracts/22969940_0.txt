Osteopontin (OPN), a secreted phosphorylated glycoprotein, has been found to be involved in carcinogenesis, progression and metastasis of several types of cancers. The aim of the present study was to investigate the immunohistochemical expression of OPN in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and its relationship with clinicopathological parameters and P53. Expression of OPN, Ki-67 and TP53 was detected in 77 cases of CRC by immunohistochemistry and the correlation of the expression of OPN with clinicopathological features, Ki-67 and P53 staining was investigated. Thirty-eight cases (49.4%) of CRC demonstrated OPN overexpression. Overexpression of OPN was associated with lymph node metastasis (P=0.025) and Dukes' stages (P=0.031), but not with gender, histological differentiation, depth of tumor invasion, TNM stages or Ki-67 index. The correlation between expression of OPN and TP53 was statistically significant (P=0.030). In conclusion, OPN is overexpressed in CRC, and plays a role in tumor progression and metastasis, which is possibly regulated by P53.
