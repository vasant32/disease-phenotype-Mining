XELOX for unresectable advanced colorectal cancer has been approved in Japan. We report here an experience of the treatment with XELOX±bevacizumab in our department. We thought that the regimen has some merits in the patient's quality of life. Forty-five patients were treated with XELOX±bevacizumab. In evaluable 23 cases, partial response (PR) was obtained in 13 cases and stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) were in 5 and 5 cases, so that the response rate and disease control rate were 56.5% and 78.2%, respectively. In the first-line administration of 19 cases, the response rate and disease control rate were respectively 80.0% and 90.0%. Hand-foot syndrome was observed in 13.2% (grade 2) and 6 .6% (grade 3). We think that it is important to control hand-foot syndrome for a continuation of XELOX±bevacizumab.
