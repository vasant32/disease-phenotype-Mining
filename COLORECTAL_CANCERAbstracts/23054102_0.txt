 BACKGROUND: Hepatic metastasis from colorectal cancer (CRC) is best managed with a multimodal approach; however, the optimal timing of liver resection in relation to administration of perioperative chemotherapy remains unclear. Our strategy has been to offer up-front liver resection for patients with resectable hepatic metastases, followed by post-liver resection chemotherapy. We report the outcomes of patients based on this surgical approach. METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients undergoing liver resection for CRC metastases over a 5-year period (2002-2007) was performed. Associations between clinicopathologic factors and survival were evaluated by the Cox proportional hazard method. RESULTS: A total of 320 patients underwent 336 liver resections. Median follow-up was 40 (range 8-80) months. The majority (n=195, 60.9%) had metachronous disease, and most patients (n=286, 85%) had a major hepatectomy (>3 segments). Thirty-six patients (11%) received preoperative chemotherapy, predominantly for downstaging unresectable disease. Ninety-day mortality was 2.1%, and perioperative morbidity occurred in 68 patients (20.2%). Actual disease-free survival at 3 and 5 years was 46.2% and 42%, respectively. Actual overall survival (OS) at 3 and 5 years was 63.7% and 55%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified four factors that were independently associated with differences in OS (hazard ratio; 95% confidence interval): size of metastasis>6 cm (2.2; 1.3-3.5), positive lymph node status of the primary CRC (N1 (2.0; 1.0-3.8), N2 (2.4; 1.2-4.9)), synchronous disease (2.1; 1.3-3.5), and treatment with chemotherapy after liver resection (0.42; 0.23-0.75). CONCLUSIONS: Up-front surgery for patients with resectable CRC liver metastases, followed by chemotherapy, can lead to favorable OS.
