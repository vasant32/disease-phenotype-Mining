To verify the effectiveness of oral 1-hexylcarbamoyl-5-fluorouracil (HCFU) in improving the surgical cure rate in advanced colorectal cancer, a multicenter randomized comparative study was conducted. A total of 429 patients who had had curative resection for stage II and III colorectal cancer were randomly assigned to a study group receiving a 14-day course of 5-FU continuous infusion (320 mg/m2/day) followed by oral HCFU for a year (300 mg/day), or to the control group receiving a 14-day course of 5-FU continuous infusion alone. In terms of background factors, no significant differences were found between the 214 patients in the study group and the 215 in the control group. Adverse reactions during the treatment were more frequently seen in the study group. But with few exceptions, the toxicities were mild and the compliance was acceptable. The 5-year overall survival rate of the study group was similar to that of the control group. The 5-year disease-free survival rate of the study group was better than that of the control group in the patients with colon cancer (hazard ratio=1.87; 95% confidence interval 1.03-3.38; p=0.037). However, this benefit was not seen in the patients with rectal cancer. A significant improvement in the disease-free survival rate was demonstrated through the addition of HCFU to 5-FU continuous infusion for the patients with colon cancer. The usefulness of oral fluoropyrimidine as an adjuvant for curative surgery for colon cancer was further warranted.
