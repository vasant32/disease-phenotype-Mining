 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a 20-mm diameter dual-design expandable colorectal stent for malignant colorectal obstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study series included 34 patients with malignant colorectal obstruction who underwent implantation of a 20-mm dual-design expandable colorectal stent in our department between March 2009 and June 2010. The 20-mm dual-design expandable colorectal stent was placed by using a 3.8-mm delivery system that had 28-mm diameter proximal and distal ends. Among the 34 patients, stent placement for palliation was performed in 20 patients, while stent placement for bridge to surgery was performed in 14 patients. RESULTS: A 97% (33 of 34) success rate was achieved for the stent placement. The perforation rate in the bridge to surgery group was 7% (1 of 14), compared to 0% (0 of 19) in palliative group. Migration occurred in one of 33 patients (3%) at 30 days after stent placement. CONCLUSION: The placement of a 20-mm diameter dual-design stent appears to be clinically safe and effective for the management of colorectal obstruction, with low perforation and migration rates.
