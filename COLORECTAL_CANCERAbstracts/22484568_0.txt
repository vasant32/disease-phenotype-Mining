 BACKGROUND: Tumor downsizing by effective chemotherapy while increasing remnant liver volume by two-stage hepatectomy can expand eligibility for resection of otherwise unresectable liver metastases. However, optimal timing of two-stage hepatectomy with respect to chemotherapy is undetermined. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the effect of timing of two-stage hepatectomy and chemotherapy using data from 95 patients whose colorectal liver metastases initially were considered unresectable. RESULTS: In 21 of 22 (95 %) patients whose first liver resection preceded chemotherapy (Hx-CTx group) and in 39 of 73 (53 %) patients whose chemotherapy preceded surgery (CTx-Hx group), macroscopic complete resection ultimately was achieved (P < 0.01). Overall and disease-free survivals were comparable between groups. However, overall survival of patients not achieving complete resection in the CTx-Hx group was significantly poorer than that for patients achieving complete resection (P < 0.01). When the 21 patients with complete resection in the Hx-CTx group were compared to the 39 patients with complete resection in the CTx-Hx group, no difference in overall or disease-free survival was observed (P = 0.12 and P = 0.24, respectively), although poor response to chemotherapy was more frequent in the Hx-CTx group. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal timing of hepatectomy and chemotherapy is difficult to specify, but performing the initial resection in a two-stage hepatectomy before chemotherapy may increase likelihood of macroscopic complete resection, even in patients with a poor response to chemotherapy or with limited courses of chemotherapy.
