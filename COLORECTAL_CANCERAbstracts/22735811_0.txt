In our previous study, we reported that endothelial cell specific molecule-1 (ESM-1) was increased in tissue and serum from colorectal cancer patients and suggested that ESM-1 can be used as a potential serum marker for early detection of colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of ESM-1 as an intracellular molecule in colorectal cancer. ESM-1 expression was knocked down by small interfering RNA (siRNA) in colorectal cancer cells. Expression of ESM-1 siRNA decreased cell survival through the Akt-dependent inhibition of NF-κB/IκB pathway and an interconnected reduction in phospho-Akt, -p38, -ERK1, -RSK1, -GSK-3α/β and -HSP27, as determined by a phospho-MAPK array. ESM-1 silencing induced G(1) phase cell cycle arrest by induction of PTEN, resulting in the inhibition of cyclin D1 and inhibited cell migration and invasion of COLO205 cells. Consistently, ESM-1 overexpression in HCT-116 cells enhanced cell proliferation through the Akt-dependent activation of NF-κB pathway. In addition, ESM-1 interacted with NF-κB and activated NF-κB promoter. This study demonstrates that ESM-1 is involved in cell survival, cell cycle progression, migration, invasion and EMT during tumor invasion in colorectal cancer. Based on our results, ESM-1 may be a useful therapeutic target for colorectal cancer.
