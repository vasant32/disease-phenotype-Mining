 BACKGROUND: Colonoscopy and polypectomy procedures have effectively reduced the incidence of colorectal cancer. Currently, competence in colonoscopy is an essential part of the education program for gastrointestinal (GI) trainees. However, considerable training is required for the optimal performance of a colonoscopy. METHODS: This study involved six colonoscopy trainees, three of whom used the cap whereas the others did not. Each trainee managed 100 cases of screening colonoscopy from beginning to end. The cecal intubation success rate, cecal intubation time, polyp detection rate, adenoma detection rate, advanced adenoma detection rate, and adenocarcinoma detection rate were checked. The rate of successful cecal intubation and the cecal intubation time were reviewed every 10 cases. RESULTS: The cecal intubation rate was 80.7 % (242/300) in the cap group and 63.3 % (190/300) in the non-cap group. The average cecal intubation time was 13.7 min in the cap group and 18.7 min in the non-cap group. The statistical analysis of these results suggested that the cap group had a significantly higher success rate (p < 0.001) and a shorter cecal intubation time (p < 0.001) than the non-cap group. However, the two groups did not differ significantly in the detection rate for polyps (45.3 vs 43 %; p = 0.565), adenomas (26.3 vs 25 %; p = 0.709), advanced adenomas (2.6 vs 0.6 %; p = 0.056), or adenocarcinomas (5.3 vs 3 %; p = 0.153). CONCLUSION: Cap-assisted colonoscopies might help to increase the rate of cecal intubation success and shorten the cecal intubation time for GI trainees.
