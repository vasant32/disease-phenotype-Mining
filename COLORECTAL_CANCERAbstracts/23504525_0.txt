The association between ABCB1/MDR1 C3435T polymorphism and colorectal cancer has been evaluated. However, the results of these studies on the association remain inconsistent. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis was performed. A comprehensive search was conducted to identify the eligible studies of ABCB1/MDR1 C3435T polymorphism and colorectal cancer risk. Summary odds ratios (OR) and 95Â % confidence interval (CI) for ABCB1/MDR1 C3435T polymorphism and colorectal cancer were calculated. Statistical analysis was performed with the Stata (Version 12.0). Thirteen case-control studies, a total of 11,339 persons including 5,485 cases and 5,854 controls, met the included criteria and thus were selected. Collectively, the results of the present study suggest that there were no significant associations of ABCB1/MDR1 C3435T polymorphism with colorectal cancer observed for all comparison models. In the subgroup analysis, the same results were detected for both Caucasian and Asian populations. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that ABCB1/MDR1 C3435T polymorphism might be not related to colorectal cancer susceptibility.
