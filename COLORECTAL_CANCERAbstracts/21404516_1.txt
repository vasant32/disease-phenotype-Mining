Colorectal cancer, in patients with ulcerative colitis, is detected in the resected tissue of approximately 5% of patients, according to the literature. In our set of 82 patients operated on between the years 2000-2009, malignancy was confirmed in 9/82 patients (11%). In two young patients, the peroperative findings showed inoperable generalized carcinoma. The greater incidence of malignity is surely associated with inconsistent dispensarization of these patients.
