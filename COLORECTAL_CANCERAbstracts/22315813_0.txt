Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) can induce carcinogenesis via DMA injury. Both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants participate in cell protection against harmful influence of oxidative stress. The aim of the present study was to assess the level of end product of lipid peroxidation such as malondialdehyde (MDA) as an oxidant in colorectal cancer. Moreover, we analyzed the activity of main non-enzymatic antioxidants, vitamin E and vitamin C in colorectal cancer patients. In the present study, total 48 samples were analyzed which includes 24 age matched healthy controls irrespective of sex (Group I) and 24 cases of colorectal cancer (Group II). The serum level of lipid peroxide, vitamin E and vitamin C were estimated in both healthy control Group I (n=24) and colorectal cancer Group II (n=24). A significant increase in the level of serum lipid peroxide (P<0.001), with concomitant decrease in the levels of serum vitamin E and vitamin C, (P<0.001) in Group II patients were noticed as compared to the healthy control Group I. Our findings suggest that increased oxidative stress and reduced antioxidants defense mechanism may play an important role in progression and pathogenesis of colorectal cancer.
