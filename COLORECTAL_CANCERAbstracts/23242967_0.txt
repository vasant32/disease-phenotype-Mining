 BACKGROUND: A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) gene at position 801 (G>A) is associated with susceptibility to certain tumors. This study aimed to investigate an association between this SNP and colorectal and gastric cancers in an Iranian population. METHOD: Genotype and allele frequencies of SDF-1 801 G>A were assessed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 109 patients with colorectal cancer, 124 with gastric cancer, and 262 normal control volunteers. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was observed in the frequencies of genotypes and alleles between patients and controls (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: SDF-1 gene polymorphism at position 801 (G>A) was not associated with colorectal and gastric cancers in Southern Iranian patients.
