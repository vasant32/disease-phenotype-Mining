KRAS p.G13D mutant metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has been identified as representing a cetuximab-sensitive subtype of KRAS mutant mCRC. This analysis aims to answer the question of whether first-line treatment of p.G13D mCRCs should include cetuximab or bevacizumab. Fifty-four patients with p.G13D mutant mCRC were pooled in this analysis. All patients underwent systemic first-line treatment with a fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin/irinotecan that was combined with either cetuximab or bevacizumab. The analysis of cetuximab-based and bevacizumab-based regimens in mCRC patients with p.G13D-mutated tumours indicated comparable data for the overall response rate (58 vs. 57%) and progression-free survival (8.0 vs. 8.7 months; hazard ratio: 0.96, P=0.9). Overall survival (OS) was 20.1 months in patients treated with cetuximab-based first-line therapy compared with 14.9 months in patients receiving bevacizumab-containing regimens (hazard ratio: 0.70, P=0.29). Logistic regressions modelling OS revealed oxaliplatin-based first-line treatment to correlate with a poor outcome (P=0.03). Moreover, a strong trend in favour of capecitabine compared with infusional 5-FU (P=0.06) was observed. Response to treatment correlated with OS in patients receiving cetuximab-based, but not bevacizumab-based regimens. This retrospective pooled analysis suggests comparable efficacy of cetuximab-based and bevacizumab-based first-line therapy in patients with p.G13D mutant mCRC. The combination with capecitabine and irinotecan was associated with a more favourable outcome compared with infusional 5-FU and oxaliplatin.
