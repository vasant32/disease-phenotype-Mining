Colorectal cancer is an important disease because of its severity and also since it affects much of the population. Nothing helps patients and doctors to determine the risk of suffering from colorectal cancer during their lives, except for medical tests such as the colonoscopy. There have been several studies and research to try to estimate the relative risks of colorectal cancer based on various factors and the applications to calculate the risk of this cancer, but these are not within everyone's research. This project offers a multilingual Web tool, called ColoRectal Cancer Alert (CRCA), to calculate the risk of colorectal cancer for life in men and women of white race. With this application, doctors can carry out research in a few minutes to explore this risk when they are seeing a patient. The platform is designed in such a way that anyone can use it. It is easy to use and intuitive. We should keep in mind that this tool does not replace diagnostic tests such as the colonoscopy or the sigmoidoscopy. It is designed so that users with the assistance of their doctor know the risk and act accordingly (for example, having more checkups on the disease in case of high risk). To access the tool a computer with Internet connection will be required. Currently, 250 users of white race under the supervision of a specialist have completed the questionnaire.
