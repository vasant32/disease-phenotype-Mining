Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that miRNAs play important roles in the occurrence and development of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, whether miRNAs are associated with the metastasis of CRC remains largely unexplored. The aim of the current study is to profile miRNAs in different CRC metastatic cell lines to identify the biomarkers in CRC metastasis. Gene and miRNA expression profiling was performed to analyze the global expression of mRNAs and miRNAs in the four human CRC cell lines (LoVo, SW480, HT29 and Caco-2) with different potential of metastasis. Expression patterns of mRNAs and miRNAs were altered in different CRC cell lines. By developing an integrated bioinformatics analysis of gene and miRNA expression patterns, hsa-let-7i was identified to show the highest degree in the microRNA-GO-network and microRNA-Gene-network. The expression level of hsa-let-7i was further validated by qRT-PCR in CRC cells. In addition, the targets of hsa-let-7i were predicted by two programs TargetScan and PicTar, and target genes were validated by expression profiling in the most epresentative LoVo and Caco-2 cell lines. Eight genes including TRIM41, SOX13, SLC25A4, SEMA4F, RPUSD2, PLEKHG6, CCND2, and BTBD3 were identified as hsa-let-7i targets. Our data showed the power of comprehensive gene and miRNA expression profiling and the application of bioinformatics tools in the identification of novel biomarkers in CRC metastasis.
