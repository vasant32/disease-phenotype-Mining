 BACKGROUND & AIMS: To assess the medico-economic impact of malnutrition in patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer. METHODS: We performed post-hoc analyses of data from the Alves et al. prospective study. Using standard criteria of malnutrition, 2 groups were created a posteriori: Well-nourished (WN) and Mal-nourished (MN) patients. The 2 groups were statistically adjusted for age, cancer status, and scheduled surgery. Individual costs were valued using the French National Cost Study. Postoperative morbidity, mortality, hospital length-of-stay (LOS), and discharge setting were compared. We defined 3 scenarios, the most accurate estimate and its upper and lower limits, to assess the economic impact of malnutrition. RESULTS: 453 patients were included in the analyses. Complication and mortality rates were not significantly different between the 2 groups. MN patients had a mean LOS 3.41 days significantly longer than WN patients (p = 0.017). In MN patients, the cost of hospital stay was increased by around 3360 €, creating an annual impact of 10,159,436 € for French non-profit hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Malnutrition in colorectal cancer surgical patients is associated with an increased LOS resulting in significant budget impact. Further studies are needed to investigate this impact and the related cost-benefit of perioperative specialized nutritional support and implementation of the ERAS protocol in this homogeneous category of patients.
