 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of NOB1 in colorectal cancer and its relationship with the clinicopathological characteristics. METHODS: The expression of NOB1 was detected immunohistochemically in 60 primary colorectal cancer tissues and the corresponding normal epithelia (3.0 cm away from the cancer margin) and graded according to the staining intensity and the percentage of positively stained tumor cells. RESULTS: NOB1 overexpression was found in 32 of the 60 cases (53.3%). NOB1 overexpression in the adjacent non-neoplastic tissues was found in 10 of the cases (16.7%), a rate significantly lower than that in the cancer tissues (P<0.05). NOB1 expression was not correlated to such tumor characteristics as gender, age, histological differentiation grade, depth of invasion and lymph node metastasis (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: NOB1 expression is higher in colorectal cancer than in normal colorectal tissues, suggesting its involvement in the tumorigenesis and progression of colorectal cancer.
