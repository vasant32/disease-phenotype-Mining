AIM: The colorectal two-week wait fast track (FT) referral system was nationally implemented in the UK in 2000 to ensure patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) received prompt access to specialized services. The aim of this study was to determine the association between the mechanism of referral to colorectal services and the 5-year outcomes for patients with CRC. METHODS: Consecutive patients with newly diagnosed CRC presenting between October 2002 and September 2004 were identified retrospectively. Analysis for survival and recurrence of disease at 5 years from presentation was undertaken. Outcomes for patients were compared between fast track (FT), non-fast track (NFT) and emergency referral (ER) routes, using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. RESULTS: Out of 189 patients, 96 (51%) presented via the FT, 41 (22.5%) via the NFT and 52 (27.5%) via the ER referral route. The 5-year overall survival was 52.6% ± 5.1, 41.5% ± 7.7 and 38.5% ± 6.7 for the FT-, NFT- and ER groups respectively (p = 0.075). The 5-year cancer specific survival was 60.3% ± 5.2, 58.8% ± 5.3 and 43.5% ± 7.2 for the FT-, NFT- and ER groups respectively (p = 0.056). Patients referred as emergencies had worse 5-year overall survival; 49.3% ± 4.3 (FT&NFT) vs. 38.5% ± 6.7 (ER) (p = 0.042) and 5-year cancer specific survival 59.8% ± 4.4 (FT&NFT) vs. 43.5% ± 7.2 (ER) (p = 0.016). A total of 136 patients (FT n = 71, NFT n = 34, ER n = 31) underwent potentially curative surgery. Differences in 5-year survival did not reach statistical significance in these patients. CONCLUSION: Referral route to specialist services for patients with CRC via the fast track pathway compared to non-fast track pathway was not associated with improved survival.
