Abnormalities in the JAK2/STAT3 pathway are involved in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC), including apoptosis. However, the exact mechanism by which dysregulated JAK2/STAT3 signalling contributes to the apoptosis has not been clarified. To investigate the role of both JAK2 and STAT3 in the mechanism underlying CRC apoptosis, we inhibited JAK2 with AG490 and depleted STAT3 with a small interfering RNA. Our data showed that inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signalling induced CRC cellular apoptosis via modulating the Bcl-2 gene family, promoting the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm) and the increase of reactive oxygen species. In addition, our results demonstrated that the translocation of cytochrome c (Cyt c), caspase activation and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were present in apoptotic CRC cells after down-regulation of JAK2/STAT3 signalling. Moreover, inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signalling suppressed CRC xenograft tumour growth. We found that JAK2/STAT3 target genes were decreased; meanwhile caspase cascade was activated in xenograft tumours. Our findings illustrated the biological significance of JAK2/STAT3 signalling in CRC apoptosis, and provided novel evidence that inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Therefore, JAK2/STAT3 signalling may be a potential target for therapy of CRC.
