The aim of the present study was to reduce 5-FU side effects by targeted nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) to LDL receptors that are over expressed in colorectal carcinoma and also use of a new synthesized conjugate of retinoic acid as a cytotoxic agent. Fatty acyl amide derivative of retinoic acid was synthesized by its conjugation to octadecylamine with the expectation to improve its loading capacity in NLCs of 5-FU. The NLCs were prepared by an emulsification-solvent evaporation method using cholesterol and cholesteryl stearate. Physical properties and drug release were studied in NLCs. The cytotoxicity of NLCs loaded with 5-FU and retinoic acid conjugate was studied on colon cancer cells (HT29) using MTT assay. To confirm that drug targeting has been done through LDL receptors, APO-E was omitted from the cell culture and the MTT assay was repeated. FTIR and (1)H NMR spectra confirmed successful production of the conjugate. Results showed the IC(50) of free 5-FU was about 7.6 Î¼M while in comparable concentration, the cytotoxicity of 5-FU loaded in NLCs containing the retinoic acid conjugate was nearly 2 fold of NLCs just loaded with 5-FU and more than 5 fold of free 5-FU. The retinoic acid conjugate loaded NLCs prepared by cholesterol can target LDL receptors of HT29 cells and seems promising in reducing 5-FU dose in colorectal cancer.
