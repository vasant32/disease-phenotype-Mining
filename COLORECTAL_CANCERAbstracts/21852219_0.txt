 INTRODUCTION: Cancer population studies require reliable and complete baseline data, which should theoretically be available by collecting histopathology records. The completeness of such a collection was evaluated using capture-recapture analysis based on three data sources concerning breast and colorectal cancers over an identical period and within the same geographical area. METHOD: The total number of breast and colon cancer cases was estimated using capture-recapture analysis based on the number of cases which were common or not between sources recording screened, diagnosed and treated cancers in the French Alpes Maritimes district. RESULT: The estimated total number of new cases of breast cancer diagnosed among Alpes Maritimes residents women aged 50-75 was 791 (95% CI: 784-797) in 2008. Of these 791 cases, 729 were identified through histopathology records, thus amounting to 92.2% completeness (95% CI: 91.5-93.0%). The total estimated number of new cases of colorectal cancer diagnosed among Alpes Maritimes residents aged 50-75 was 527 (95% CI: 517-536). Of these 527 cases, 481 were identified through histopathology records, thus amounting to 91.3% completeness (95% CI: 89.7-93.0%). CONCLUSION: The estimated completeness of cancer records collected from histopathology laboratories was higher than 90% for new cases of breast and colorectal cancer within the age range concerned by the screening programme. A verified and validated histopathology data collection may be useful for cancer population studies.
