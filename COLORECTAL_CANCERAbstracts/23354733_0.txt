Vascular growth factor (VEGF) is an important mediator of angiogenesis. PI3K plays essential roles in angiogenesis; however, the mechanisms and specific functions of individual isoforms of PI3K members in tumor angiogenesis regulation are still not fully understood. In this study, we evaluate the role of p55PIK, a PI3K regulatory subunit encoded by PIK3R3 gene, in tumor angiogenesis. We reported that overexpression of p55PIK in cancer cells up-regulated HIF-1α expression and increased VEGF expression. Furthermore, overexpression of p55PIK increased tumor angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, data indicated enhanced HIF-1α expression by p55PIK-PI3K depended on its ability to activate NF-кB signaling pathways, especially to increase the phosphorylation of p65 subunits of NF-κB. Our study suggested that p55PIK-PI3K was essential in regulating cancer cell-mediated angiogenesis and contributed to tumor growth and that the p55PIK provides a potential and specific target for new anti-angiogenesis drug development.
