 AIMS: Mucinous adenocarcinoma (MUC) is a histological variant of colorectal adenocarcinoma. The aim of the present study was to characterize clinicopathological features and identify prognostic factors of MUCs. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 181 patients with MUC who underwent surgery between 1975 and 2003 were reviewed. The clinicopathological features of these patients were compared with those of 4125 non-MUC patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify significant prognostic factors in 102 patients with pT3 or pT4 tumour who underwent curative surgery. Patients with MUCs tended to present with more advanced clinical stages. The overall 5-year survival rate of MUC patients was lower than that of non-MUC patients; however, no prognostic difference was found when patients with the same clinical stages were compared. Multivariate analysis revealed male sex, bowel obstruction and infiltrating growth type as independent prognostic factors. Five-year cancer-specific survival rates for MUC patients with â‰¤1, 2 and 3 risk factors identified by multivariate analysis were 95.5%, 52.1% and 0.0%, respectively (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Mucinous adenocarcinoma represents a distinct clinicopathological entity. Sex, bowel obstruction and growth patterns might be useful prognostic factors to identify patients with a high risk of recurrence after curative resection of advanced MUCs.
