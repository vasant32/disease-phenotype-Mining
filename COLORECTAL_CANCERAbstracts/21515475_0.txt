 OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) mRNA levels in the peripheral blood and the metastasis of colorectal cancer. METHODS: HIF-1α mRNA in the peripheral blood was detected by RT-PCR in 40 patients with colorectal cancer and 20 healthy subjects. RESULTS: Seventeen patients with colorectal cancer showed positivity for HIF-1α mRNA, showing a significantly higher positivity rate (42.5%) than the healthy subjects (P<0.05). The expression of HIF-1α mRNA is closely related to the staging of colorectal cancer (CRC). CONCLUSION: HIF-1α mRNA may serve as a potential marker in the detection of metastasis of colorectal cancer.
