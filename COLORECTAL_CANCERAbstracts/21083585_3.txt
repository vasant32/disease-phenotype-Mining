 BACKGROUND: Infection following abdominal operation remains a major factor affecting the morbidity of patients after surgery. AIM: To determine the effects of perioperative administration of probiotics on the gut barrier function and the surgical outcome in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. METHODS: One hundred patients with colorectal carcinoma were randomly divided into the control group (n = 50) and the probiotics group (n = 50). The probiotics were given orally for 6 days preoperatively and 10 days post-operatively. Outcomes were measured by bacterial translocation, gut permeability, the effect on the faecal microbiota, and the clinical outcomes such as infectious-related complications and gut defecation function. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, probiotics group had increased transepithelial resistance (P < 0.05), reduced transmucosal permeation of horseradish peroxidase and lactulose/mannitol ratio, reduced bacterial translocation (P < 0.05), decreased ileal-bile acid binding protein (P < 0.05) and positive rate of blood bacterial DNA (P < 0.05) and an enhanced mucosal tight junction protein expression. They had decreased blood enteropathogenic bacteria and increased faecal bacterial variety. The post-operative recovery of peristalsis, incidence of diarrhoea, and infectious-related complications were also improved. CONCLUSION: Probiotics can improve the integrity of gut mucosal barrier by benefiting the faecal microbiota, and decreasing infectious complications in patients with colorectal cancer undergoing colorectomy.
