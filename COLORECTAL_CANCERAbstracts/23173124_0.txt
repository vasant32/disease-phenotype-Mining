microRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by targeting specific mRNAs. microRNAs play a role in several physiological processes in the cell, including migration, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Apart from their role in regular metabolism, abnormal profiles of miRNA expression accompany cancer transformation, including colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis. microRNAs may play a role in each phase of CRC metastasis including angiogenesis, invasion, intravasation, circulation, extravasation and metastatic colonization. microRNA levels may serve as a predictive CRC marker, which was confirmed by the serum level of miR-29a targeting KLF4, a marker of cell stemness, and the plasma level of miR-221 down-regulating c-Kit, Stat5A and ETS1, which are signal transducers and transcription factor, respectively. In turn, the level of miR-143 in CRC cells decreasing the amount of MACC1 (metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1) and oncogenic KRAS protein, may be utilized as a prognostic marker. Also, single nucleotide polymorphisms of genes encoding miRNAs, including miR-423 and miR-608, which correlate with tumor recurrence, may be useful as diagnostic, prognostic and predictive indicators in CRC metastasis. Pre-miR-34a and pre-miR-199a decreased the level of Axl, a tyrosine-protein kinase receptor, so they can be considered as drugs in antimetastatic therapy. On the other hand, miR-222 targeting ADAM-17, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase, and miR-328 interacting with ABCG2, an ABC transporter, may overcome drug resistance of cancer cells. microRNAs may be considered in wide-range application to facilitate CRC metastasis diagnosis, prognosis, prediction and therapy, however, further clinical, epidemiological and in vitro studies should be conducted to verify their utility.
