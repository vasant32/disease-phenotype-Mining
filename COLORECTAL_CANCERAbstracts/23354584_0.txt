The present study aimed to analyse the role of cyclin D1 A870G polymorphism             in modulating the susceptibility to colorectal cancer (CRC) in the Kashmiri population.             The genotype distribution of the cyclin D1 gene in 130 CRC cases in comparison             with 160 healthy controls was investigated. No direct significant association             between cyclin D1 genotypes and CRC was observed; however, the AG and AA genotypes             were found to be associated with an increased risk of CRC compared to the GG genotype,             with an almost 2-fold increase in OR. This study suggests that the cyclin D1 polymorphism             is associated with an increased risk of CRC in the Kashmiri population.
