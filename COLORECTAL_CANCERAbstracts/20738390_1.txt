While colorectal cancer is the most common cancer affecting both men and women in Australia, disease-specific peer support services are lacking. This study examined the acceptability and preferred models of peer support among people with colorectal cancer. First, a mixed-method study examined enablers and barriers to peer support participation and model preferences. Participants were recruited from metropolitan and regional areas of Victoria. Fifty-three participants completed a questionnaire and four focus groups and 10 telephone interviews were conducted (n = 34). Participants demonstrated enthusiasm for peer support. Feeling unwell and worry about accessing toilet facilities were main barriers, while accessing information about treatment side effects and making treatment decisions were main positive features. Second, a pilot study determined the response to a face-to-face group and one-on-one telephone programme, the preferred models from study 1. In total, 34 support recipients recruited through clinicians, participated. Half elected to participate in the telephone programme and half in the group programme. Support recipients completed surveys before and after the programmes. Both models were acceptable to participants with high satisfaction rates reported (94-100%) and findings suggested that the two models catered to different peer support needs. Timing of referral and clinician promotion contributed to participation.
