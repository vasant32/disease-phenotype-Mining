 BACKGROUND: CD164 (Endolyn) is a sialomucin, which has been found to play roles in regulating proliferation, adhesion, and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. Possible association of CD164 with solid cancer development remains unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We first studied CD164 expression in biopsies from colorectal cancer, breast, and ovary cancer patients by semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry, and found that CD164 was strongly expressed in all the colorectal cancer samples compared to the matching normal colon tissues. The possible roles of CD164 in colon cancer development were further investigated using a well-established human colon cancer cell line HCT116. We found that knockdown of CD164 expression in HCT116 cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation, mobility, and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. The knockdown of CD164 expression was associated with decreased chemokine receptor CXCR4 expression HCT116 cell surface and immunoprecipitation studies showed that CD164 formed complexes with CXCR4. CONCLUSIONS: CD164 is highly expressed in the colon cancer sites, and it promotes HCT116 colon cancer cell proliferation and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo, and the effects may act through regulating CXCR4 signaling pathway. Therefore, CD164 may be a new target for diagnosis and treatment for colon cancer.
