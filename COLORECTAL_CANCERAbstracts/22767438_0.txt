 BACKGROUND: In the last decade, studies in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) demonstrate dysregulation of miRNAs expression. For instance, miR-650 has been implicated in gastric and colorectal cancer tumorigenicity; however, the role of miR-650 remains unknown in HCC. METHODS: In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis to examine the miR-650 expression level in 248 HCC and 120 paracarcinomatous liver (PCL) tissues. The correlations between miR-650 expression level and the clinicopathological characteristics (HCC tumorigenicity) were evaluated. The role of miR-650 played in HCC was investigated by Q-PCR, western blot, and MTT. RESULTS: We found that miR-650 expression was significantly increased in HCC patients and significantly associated with the patients' age (P = 0.0019), differentiation capability (P = 0.0108), and also tumor stage (P = 0.0069). Moreover, we compared the expression level of both ING4 and miR-650 in 122 HCC patients by western blot and real-time PCR. Statistical result showed a significant negative correlation between them (r(s)  = -0.2011, P = 0.0264). Transfection and MTT test suggested that miR-650 decreased the expression of ING4 and stimulate liver cells proliferation significantly. CONCLUSION: These data suggested that miR-650 is correlated with the pathogenesis of HCC and is involved in the HCC tumorigenesis process by inhibiting the expression of ING4.
