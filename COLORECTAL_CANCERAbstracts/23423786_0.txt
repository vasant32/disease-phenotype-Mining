GATA-binding protein 2 (GATA2) is a nuclear transcription factor that plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. High levels of GATA2 expression are correlated with poor survival outcomes in many types of cancer. However, the expression and prognostic significance of GATA2 in colorectal cancer remain unknown. In this study, GATA2 protein expression was examined using immunohistochemistry in 307 colorectal cancer tissues, and its association with clinicopathological features and prognosis was analyzed. The expression of GATA2 was found to be significantly higher in colorectal cancer tissues than in matched adjacent noncancerous tissues (60.3 vs. 9.0 %, P < 0.0001). The expression of GATA2 was significantly correlated with tumor location (P = 0.005), histological type (P = 0.019), and recurrence (P = 0.009). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that patients with high levels of GATA2 expression had worse disease-free survival outcomes than those with low levels of GATA2 expression (P = 0.016). Univariate analysis showed high levels of GATA2 expression to be significantly associated with shorter periods of disease-free survival (HR 2.196; 95 % CI 1.142-4.226; P = 0.018). Multivariate analysis showed GATA2 expression to be an independent prognostic factor for patients with colorectal cancer (HR 1.952; 95 % CI 1.010-3.775; P = 0.047). These findings suggest that high levels of GATA2 expression may be a useful indicator of disease recurrence after curative colorectal cancer treatment.
