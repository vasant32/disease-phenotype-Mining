 PURPOSE: To determine whether a hypercaloric and hyperlipidic diet enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids influences the formation of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in colonic mucosa of Wistar rats treated with azoxymethane (AOM). METHODS: At eight weeks of life, the rats were assigned to four groups: Group I-standard diet (STD) not treated with AOM; Group II-hypercaloric and hyperlipidic diet (FED), not treated with AOM; Group III-STD, treated with AOM; Group IV-FED, treated with AOM. At 16 weeks, the animals were injected intraperitoneal with 0.9% saline solution (Group I and II) or AOM at 15 mg/Kg (Groups III and IV) once a week for two weeks. Fifteen weeks later, the animals were euthanized. RESULTS: FED promoted weight gain in Groups II and IV compared to Groups I and III, respectively. The groups did not differ with regard to the total number of ACF. The Chi-square test revealed no predominance of the presence of foci with <4 crypts. However, foci with â‰¥5 crypts were proportionally more prevalent in Group III than in Group IV (p=0.043). CONCLUSION: The administration of polyunsaturated fatty acids did not interfere with the formation of aberrant crypt foci, but reduced ACF multiplicity, exercising an attenuating effect on carcinogenesis.
