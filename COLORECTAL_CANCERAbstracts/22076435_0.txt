The study of tumor biomarkers was gradually facilitated by the adoption             of proteomic strategies due to less invasiveness and higher sensitivity. Colorectal             cancer is one of the most commonly occurring cancers worldwide and its incidence             has markedly increased in Korea. While the adoption of proteomic strategies facilitated             the study of tumor biomarkers, to date, no common agreement has been derived from             proteomic investigations regarding tumor markers of colorectal cancer. This study             was designed to find molecules differentially expressed in colorectal cancer compared             to non-tumor mucosa. Four colorectal adenocarcinoma and corresponding non-tumor             tissue samples were analyzed to find previously unknown proteins via two-dimensional             electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/MS spectrometry. Western blot assays and tissue             microarray (TMA) immunohistochemistry were performed to validate the identified             proteins. Among the twelve up-regulated and one down-regulated proteins identified,             moesin, cytokeratin (KRT) 17 and carbonic anhydraseÂ I were validated by western             blot analysis and/or immunohistochemistry. On immunohistochemistry, both moesin             and KRT17 demonstrated a tendency of increased expression as pT stage advanced.             Both moesin and KRT17 were not expressed in normal colorectal epithelium. These             two proteins may play a role in cancer invasion and/or metastasis in colorectal             carcinoma, and could be candidate biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of             colorectal cancer.
