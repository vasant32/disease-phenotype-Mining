Abstract Colorectal cancer is an aggressive malignancy with a high mortality rate; however, effective therapies are currently lacking. Cancer-targeting gene-virotherapy (CTGVT) has been proposed to be a promising strategy for cancer therapy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the antitumor activity of the oncolytic adenovirus harboring Lipocalin-2 (ZD55-Lipocalin-2, an example of CTGVT) in colorectal cancer. ZD55-Lipocalin-2 was generated by deleting E1B55-KD and inserting the Lipocalin-2 gene. Its cytopathic effects and cell growth inhibition were detected in vitro, and antitumor effects were examined in a nude mouse model of human colorectal cancer xenografts. Results showed that ZD55-Lipocalin-2 significantly inhibited the colorectal cancer growth by selective cytolysis, inducing apoptosis and decreasing the microvessel density in tumors. The anticancer potential of ZD55-Lipocalin-2 showed stronger than that of the isolated Lipocalin-2 gene therapy or isolated ZD55 oncolytic adenovirus therapy. ZD55-Lipocalin-2 may serve as a potential anticancer agent for colorectal cancer treatment.
