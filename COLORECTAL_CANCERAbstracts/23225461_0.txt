 BACKGROUND: Discontinuation of oxaliplatin-containing regimens is sometimes necessary due to hypersensitivity reactions for which effective countermeasures have not yet been identified. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed cases in which hypersensitivity reactions developed in 623 patients treated with oxaliplatin for colorectal cancer. Clinical outcomes of patients who underwent oxaliplatin rechallenge with rechallenge protocol (STEP 1: hydrocortisone, chlorpheniramine, and/or ranitidine; STEP 2: hydrocortisone with an escalating dose to 500 mg, and/or prolonged administration time of oxaliplatin; and STEP 3: STEP 2 plus a subcutaneous injection of epinephrine) were examined. RESULTS: Out of 623 patients, 126 (20.2%) patients developed hypersensitivity reactions. Out of these 126 patients, 99 (78.6%) underwent oxaliplatin rechallenge. As the initial oxaliplatin rechallenge, 19 patients received subsequent treatment without the rechallenge protocol and 80 patients received oxaliplatin with the rechallenge protocol of STEP 1 (n=64), STEP 2 (n=15), and STEP 3 (n=1). The median number of oxaliplatin rechallenges was 3 (range=1 to 29). The reason for treatment discontinuation was disease progression in 55 patients (56%) and hypersensitivity reactions in 21 patients (21%). Overall hypersensitivity reactions after rechallenge were observed in 59%, with grade 3/4 in 6%. CONCLUSION: The rechallenge protocol is an effective treatment option for patients with oxaliplatin hypersensitivity reactions.
