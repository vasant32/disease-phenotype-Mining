 INTRODUCTION: Adhesion molecules take part in the interaction between host cells and cancer cells. In the current study the relationship between the soluble adhesion molecules sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 and proangiogenic factor VEGF in colorectal cancer progression were measured. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 46 patients with colorectal carcinoma (classified due to TNM classification) and 40 controls. sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and VEGF plasma concentration were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: All measured parameters levels were increased significantly in patients with colorectal cancer in comparison to controls (p<0.001). sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and VEGF increased significantly due to colorectal cancer progression. There was a positive correlation between sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 in all study groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated in CRC patients significantly increased levels of soluble adhesion molecules (VCAM-1 and sICAM-1) and angiogenic factor (VEGF) as compared to control group. The dynamics of these molecules showed the growing tendency along with tumor size and metastasis formation.
