 AIM: Despite the incidence of colorectal cancer increasing with age the proportion of patients undergoing surgery for colorectal liver metastases decreases dramatically in the elderly. Is this referral or selection bias justified? METHOD: A prospective database of resection for colorectal liver metastases at a single centre was retrospectively analysed to compare the outcome in patients aged â‰¥75 years (group E) with those aged <75 years (group Y). Data were analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method with Cox regression modelling. RESULTS: Of 1443 resections, 151 (10.5%) in group E were compared with 1292 (89.5%) in group Y. The two groups were matched apart from higher American Society of Anesthesiology scores (P=0.001) and less use of chemotherapy (P=0.01) in the elderly. Perioperative morbidity and 90-day mortality were higher in the elderly compared with the younger group (32.5%vs 21.2%, P=0.02, and 7.3%vs 1.3%, P=0.001). In the last 5 years, mortality in the elderly improved and was no longer significantly different from that of the younger patients [n=2/76 (2.6%) vs n=9/559 (1.6%); P=0.063]. The 5-year survival was similar in groups E and Y for cancer-specific (41.4%vs 41.6%, P=0.917), overall (37.0%vs 38.2%) and median (44.1 months vs 43.6 months, P=0.697) survival respectively. CONCLUSION: In the elderly liver resection for metastatic disease can be performed with acceptable mortality and morbidity with as good a prospect of survival as for younger patients.
