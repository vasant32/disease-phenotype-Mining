 BACKGROUND AND AIM: Appropriate antibiotic selection and timing of administration for prophylaxis are crucial to reduce the likelihood of surgical site infection (SSI) after a clean contaminated cancer surgery. Our aim is to compare the use of two prophylactic antibiotic (PA) regimens as regards efficacy, timing, and cost. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred patients with gastric, bladder, or colorectal cancer were randomized to receive preoperative PA, group A received penicillin G sodium and gentamicin and group B received clindamycin and amikacin intravenously. The demographic data of patients were collected, and they were observed for wound infections. RESULTS: Infected wounds occurred in 19 patients with a rate of 9.5%. Highest incidence of SSI was among bladder cancer patients (14.2%); p=0.044. The rate of SSI was 11% in group A, and 8% in group B, p=0.469. The cost of PA administered in group A was significantly less than that of group B (21.96±3.22LE versus 117.05±12.74LE, respectively; p<0.001). SSI tended to be higher among those who had longer time for antibiotic and incision (⩾30min) than those who had shorter time interval (<30min), (13% vs. 6.5%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Both penicillin+gentamicin and clindamycin+amikacin are safe and effective for the prevention of SSI in clean contaminated operative procedures. In a resource limited hospital, a regimen including penicillin+gentamicin is a cost-effective alternative for the more expensive and broader coverage of clindamycin+amikacin. Timing of PA is effective in preventing SSIs when administered 30min before the start of surgery.
