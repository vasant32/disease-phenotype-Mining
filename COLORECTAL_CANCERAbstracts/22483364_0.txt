A fatty diet is regarded as one of the most important risk factors related to the etiology of colorectal cancer, and this effect is linked to the quantity and principal types of fatty acids consumed. In this study, the chemopreventive effects of different oils on rats were investigated. Forty Wistar rats received 1,2-dimetilhidrazine (DMH) and were divided into 4 groups fed normal lipid diets to which 4% olive, fish, flaxseed, or soybean oils (control) were added. The group fed with fish oil presented higher levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid in hepatic tissue and greater levels of linolenic acid and EPA in adipose tissue compared to the other treatments. In the proximal portion of the colon, lower levels of aberrant crypt foci were found in the fish and flaxseed oil groups; however, this behavior was not observed in the middle and distal regions. Via a benchmarking method, the fish oil group showed a greater transforming growth factor Î² expression and lower interleukin-8 expression in relation to the other treatments. Fish oil in a normal lipid diet demonstrated a limited protective effect on the colonic precancerous mucosa in carcinogen-treated rodents, whereas it had a beneficial effect on inflammatory modulation.
