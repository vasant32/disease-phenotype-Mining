Naringenin has been shown to display various biological effects such as             antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral activities. Taxifolin             inhibits the production of lipopolysaccharide-induced prostaglandinÂ E, and fustin             suppresses the activity of acetylcholinesterase. They all belong to flavanone             which is a class of flavonoids with a C6-C3-C6 skeleton. Since the anticancer             activities of flavanone derivatives have rarely been reported, we examined the             effects of 26 flavanone derivatives on HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. Our results             suggest that flavanone derivatives control the expression of cell cycle regulatory             proteins, which blocks G1 cell cycle progression and inhibits the clonogenicity             of HCT116 cells. In addition, in order to design flavanone derivatives that show             better anticancer activity, structure-activity relationships were examined.
