 AIM: The study aimed to investigate whether narrow-band imaging (NBI) can enhance adenoma detection in patients at high risk for adenomas compared with high-definition white-light endoscopy (WLE). High risk was defined as three or more adenomas at last colonoscopy, history of colorectal cancer and positive faecal occult blood test. METHOD: Two hundred and fourteen patients were randomized 1:1 to examination with NBI or WLE. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with at least one adenoma detected. Secondary outcomes included total adenomas and polyps, flat adenomas, nonadenomatous polyps, advanced adenomas and patients with three or five or more adenomas. A post hoc analysis to examine the effect of endoscopist and bowel preparation was performed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with at least one adenoma: NBI 73%vs WLE 66%, odds ratio 1.40 (95% CI 0.78-2.52), P = 0.26. There was no significant difference for any secondary outcome measure except for the number of flat adenomas which was significantly greater with NBI [comparison ratio 2.66 (95% CI 1.52-4.63), P = 0.001]. Post hoc analysis indicated that one of three endoscopists performed significantly better for adenoma detection with NBI than WLE [comparison ratio 1.92 (95% CI 1.07-3.44), P = 0.03]. Good bowel preparation was associated with significantly improved adenoma detection with NBI [comparison ratio 1.55 (95% CI 1.01-2.22), P = 0.04] but not with fair preparation. CONCLUSION: Overall NBI did not improve detection compared with WLE in a group of patients at high risk for colorectal adenomas, but specific subgroups might benefit.
