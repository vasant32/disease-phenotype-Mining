Background:Although family history is well established to be a risk factor for developing colorectal cancer (CRC), much less is known about its impact on patient survival. This study aimed to link CRC patient data from the National Study of Colorectal Cancer Genetics (NSCCG) to the National Cancer Data Repository (NCDR) to examine the relationship between family history and the characteristics and outcomes of CRC.Methods:All eligible NSCCG patients underwent a matching process to the NCDR using combinations of their personal identifiers. The characteristics and survival of CRC patients with and without a family history of CRC were compared.Results:Of the 10 937 NSCCG patients eligible to be matched into the NCDR, 10 782 (98.6%) could be fully linked. There were no significant differences between those with and without a family history of CRC (defined as having at least one affected first-degree relative) in terms of age, sex, tumour stage at diagnosis, presence of multiple cancers, mode of presentation to hospital and surgical management, although patients with familial CRC were more likely to have right-sided tumours (P<0.01). The survival of patients with familial CRC was significantly better than those with sporadic CRC (HR 0.89, 95%CI: 0.81-0.98, P=0.02).Conclusion:We have demonstrated that it is possible to robustly match patients recruited into the NSCCG into the NCDR and, by using this record linkage, enable genetic data to be related to CRC phenotype, clinical management and outcome. This study provides evidence that a family history of CRC is associated with better survival after a diagnosis of CRC.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 19 March 2013; doi:10.1038/bjc.2013.91 www.bjcancer.com.
