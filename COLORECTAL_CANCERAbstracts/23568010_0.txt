 BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in the world. Therefore, there is a high demand for cost-effective and non-invasive biomarkers that would enable an early detection of asymptomatic and curable disease with high sensitivity and specificity. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to investigate the potential of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers of CRC. METHODS: Total RNA enriched for small RNAs was isolated from 100~sera of patients with CRC and 30 sera of healthy donors. The expression levels of miR-17-3p, miR-29a, miR-92a and miR-135b were determined using quantitative real-time PCR. The average expression levels of particular miRNAs were normalized to miR-16 levels and statistically evaluated. RESULTS: Using Mann-Whitney U test, no significant differences were observed in miR-17-3p (P=0.18), miR-29a (P=0.14) and miR-92a (P=0.60) levels between sera of CRC patients and controls. The levels of miR-135b in serum were too low to be quantified accurately. Subsequently, we tried to correlate expression levels of analyzed miRNAs to clinical-pathological features of CRC patients. Only levels of mir-29a were correlated with the clinical stage (P=0.04). Expression levels of the other miRNAs were correlated neither with the clinical stage, nor with the grade. CONCLUSIONS: Interestingly, our results are contradictory to previous studies performed on the CRC patients from Chinese population, providing an evidence against usage of serum miR-17-3p, miR-29a, miR-92a and miR-135b as new biomarkers for early detection of CRC.
