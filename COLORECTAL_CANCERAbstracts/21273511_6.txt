 BACKGROUND: Cetuximab was demonstrated by clinical trials to improve response rate and survival of patients with metastatic and nonresectable colorectal cancer or carcinoma of the head and neck. Appropriate management of skin toxicity associated with epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor (EGFR-i) therapy is necessary to allow adequate drug administration and to improve quality of life and outcomes. METHODS: A group of Italian Experts produced recommendations for skin toxicity management using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method. Statements were generated on the basis of a systematic revision of the literature and voted twice by a panel of 40 expert physicians; the second vote was preceded by a meeting of the panelists. RESULTS: Skin toxicity included skin rash, skin dryness, pruritus, paronychia, hair abnormality, and mucositis. Recommendations for prophylaxis and therapeutic interventions for each type of toxicity were proposed. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that were considered appropriate to improve compliance and outcomes of cancer patients treated with EGFR-i were identified.
