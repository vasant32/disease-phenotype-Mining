The pathogenesis of colitis-associated colorectal cancer is strongly influenced by immune cells, cytokines and other immune mediators present in the inflamed colon. Current research has emerged that T helper cell associated cytokines play a prominent role in tumor growth. In our recent manuscript we have revealed that the Th17 associated cytokine IL-21 prominently influences tumor development and immunosurveillance of colitis-associated colorectal cancer.
