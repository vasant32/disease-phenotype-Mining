 HISTORY AND ADMISSION FINDINGS: We report on a 65-year-old female patient with a recent diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon and massive hematochezia in the context of a general bleeding disorder. INVESTIGATIONS: Disseminated malignant disease with hepatic metastases as well as bone marrow involvement was demonstrated. Moreover, circulating tumor cells were demonstrated by flow cytometry. The patient had right lower quadrant abdominal pain due to a spontaneous psoas intramuscular hematoma. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: At the time of admission to our hospital, the patient displayed microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and secondary hyperfibrinolysis with a pronounced bleeding tendency. Moreover, there was an acute renal failure which improved with fluid resuscitation. With immediate chemotherapy consisting of 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX regimen) and cetuximab initiated with the second course, plasmatic coagulation could be stabilized. Consequently, treatment with tranexamic acid, fibrinogen, fresh frozen plasma as well as red blood cell and platelet infusions could be stopped. Continuation of chemotherapy was possible on an outpatient basis and the further course was associated with a good quality of life until her near end. The patient died at home 7 months after initial diagnosis of her colon cancer due to progressive disease with CNS metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Disseminated intravascular coagulation with microangiopathic hemolysis and secondary hyperfibrinolysis is a rare albeit possible event in disseminated colorectal cancer, especially when the bone marrow is involved. Treatment of the underlying cause is the most important therapeutic measure.
