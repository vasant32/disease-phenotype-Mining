 AIM: To study the relation between CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism and colorectal cancer risk by meta-analysis. METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed to investigate the relation between CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism and colorectal cancer risk by reviewing the related studies until September 2010. Data were extracted and analyzed. Crude odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the strength of relation between CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism and colorectal cancer risk. RESULTS: Thirteen published case-control studies including 5336 cases and 6226 controls were acquired. The pooled OR with 95% CI indicated that CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism was significantly related with colorectal cancer risk (Val/Val vs Ile/Ile: OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.16-1.86, P = 0.002; dominant model: OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.01-1.75, P = 0.04; recessive model: OR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.18-1.88, P = 0.0009). Subgroup ethnicity analysis showed that CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism was also significantly related with colorectal cancer risk in Europeans (Ile/Val vs Ile/Ile: OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.05-1.42, P = 0.008; dominant model: OR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.07-1.43, P = 0.004) and Asians (Val/Val vs Ile/Ile: OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.07-1.82, P = 0.01; recessive model: OR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.12-1.89, P = 0.005). CONCLUSION: CYP1A1 Ile462Val may be an increased risk factor for colorectal cancer.
