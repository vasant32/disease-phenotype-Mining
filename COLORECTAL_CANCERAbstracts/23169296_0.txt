 BACKGROUND: We conducted an open-label, pilot phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FOLFOXIRI plus cetuximab as first-line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). METHODS: Thirty patients with KRAS wild-type mCRC, <70 years and with performance status 0-1 were included in the trial. RESULTS: Complete and partial responses were observed in 4 (13.3%) and 17 (56.7%) patients, respectively (overall response rate (ORR)=70%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 53.6%-86.4%); 8 patients (26.7%) had stable disease and 1 had progressive disease. The median time to tumour progression was 10.2 months (95% CI: 7.1-13.4) and the overall median survival time was 30.3 months (95% CI: 18.8-41.9). Secondary R0 resection was performed in 11 (37%) patients. Grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea and neutropenia were observed in 16 (53%) and 7 (23.3%) patients, respectively, and febrile neutropenia observed in 2 (6.6%) patients. Neurotoxicity grade 2 or 3 was reported in 7 (23.3%) and in 2 (6.7%) patients, respectively, and grade 3 rush was reported in 1 patient. CONCLUSION: The FOLFOXIRI/cetuximab combination presented increased activity in terms of response rate and R0 secondary liver metastases resection, and merits further investigation, especially in patients with initially unresectable disease confined to the liver.
