 PURPOSE: Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a unique cytokine that is thought to be a potent immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive factor. The aim of this study was to investigate IL-10 expression in colorectal cancer, and clarify its relationship to the clinicopathological findings and prognosis. METHODS: Tissue samples were collected from 92 patients with colorectal cancer and adjacent normal mucosa. The expression of IL-10 in colorectal cancer tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Tissue levels of IL-10 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The mean concentration of IL-10 did not significantly differ between the cancer tissue and adjacent normal mucosa. The IL-10 concentration in cancer tissue with positive staining immunohistochemically was significantly higher than that without IL-10 staining. The IL-10 level in cancer tissue decreased in accordance with advanced-stage serosal invasion and lymph node involvement, and thus predicted poor survival in patients undergoing surgery with curative intent. A Cox multivariate analysis demonstrated that a decreased IL-10 level in cancer tissue was an independent risk factor for poor survival. CONCLUSION: The tumor IL-10 level in colorectal cancer was inversely correlated with serosal invasion and lymph node metastasis, which thus reflected tumor progression. Evaluating the tumor expression of IL-10 may therefore provide valuable information for predicting the long-term survival in patients undergoing surgery with curative intent.
