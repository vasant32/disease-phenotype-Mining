Although the treatment for colorectal cancer has seen considerable progress during the past few years, the mortality associated with this type of tumor remains high. This article presents the existing methods of treatment, focusing on the new treatments made possible by the advances in the field of normal and tumor stem cells. Starting from the normal architecture of the colon and the properties of the cells identified in it, we sought to present a few notions concerning these cells which have a direct relevance for both pathology and treatment. The manner in which they divide (symmetrically or asymmetrically) as well as the molecules which control their circulation through the body are just a few examples which are likely to influence the treatment of colorectal cancer in the future.
