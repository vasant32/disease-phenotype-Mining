BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab, a humanized anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody, has showed clinical benefits in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Periodontitis has been observed infrequently in bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy in clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively investigate bevacizumab-related periodontitis in metastatic colorectal cancer patients. METHODS: From January 2008 to March 2010, 274 patients received bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy at the National Cancer Center Hospital in Tokyo. Patients who had consulted the dentist for periodontitis were included in the study. We examined the interval between the initiation of the first bevacizumab administration and the day of the consultation with the dentist. Periodontitis was evaluated before and after conservative therapy. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients (9.5 % of the 274 metastatic colorectal cancer patients) were included in this study. The median age was 60 years (range 30-79 years). Nineteen (73 %) patients had a good performance status of 0. The combination regimens used with bevacizumab were infusional 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX, 53 %); infusional 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI, 27 %); capecitabine + oxaliplatin (CapeOX, 8 %); S-1 + oxaliplatin (8 %); and S-1 + irinotecan (4 %). The median time from bevacizumab administration to the consultation with a dentist for periodontitis was 69 days (range 12-390 days), and the median number of bevacizumab administrations was 3.5 (range 1-25). After conservative therapy, 22 (85 %) patients with periodontitis showed an improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Periodontitis occurred frequently in patients receiving bevacizumab. The conservative therapy for periodontitis was very effective, and the prophylaxitic treatment was important.
