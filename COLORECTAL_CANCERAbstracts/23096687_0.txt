Epidemiological studies of the association of variants p53 Arg72Pro and MDM2 single-nucleotide polymorphism 309 (SNP309)  with glioma risk have produced inconsistent results. The aim of the current  study was to evaluate the association of these 2 variants with glioma  susceptibility using a meta-analysis approach. For p53 Arg72Pro, 10  case-control studies including 2587 glioma patients and 4061 unrelated controls  were identified. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) for Arg/Pro heterozygotes and  Pro/Pro homozygotes were 1.08 [95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 0.85-1.37] and  1.08 (95%CI = 0.85-1.36), respectively, when compared to Arg/Arg carriers.  Under the dominant effect model, Pro allele carriers also showed no  significantly elevated glioma risk (pooled OR = 1.11, 95%CI = 0.90-1.38), and  similar results were found under the recessive-effect model (pooled OR = 1.17,  95%CI = 0.85-1.61). For variant MDM2 SNP309, 3 case-control studies  including 606 cases and 309 controls were identified. A marginal association  with glioma risk was found for heterozygous G/T carriers (pooled OR = 1.95,  95%CI = 1.00- 3.81), whereas homozygous G/G carriers showed an increased but  not significantly elevated risk of glioma (pooled OR = 2.14, 95%CI = 0.71-6.45)  compared with that of T/T homozygotes. We also found no significant association  between the MDM2 SNP309 polymorphism and glioma risk (pooled OR = 1.86,  95%CI = 0.94-3.67 and pooled OR = 1.25, 95%CI = 0.62-2.56, respectively) under  the dominant and recessive models. Taken together, the current data suggested  that the 2 polymorphisms may not contribute to glioma susceptibility.
