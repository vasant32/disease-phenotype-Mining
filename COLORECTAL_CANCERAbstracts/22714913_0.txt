To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship between miR-149 C>T polymorphism and cancer risk, a meta-analysis was performed. A total of 8 studies including 4,677 cases and 4,830 controls were involved in this meta-analysis. Overall, no significantly elevated cancer risk was associated with miR-149 T allele when all studies were pooled into the meta-analysis (CT vs. CC: OR = 0.977, 95 % CI = 0.882-1.082; TT vs. CC: OR = 0.985, 95 % CI = 0.857-1.132; dominant model: OR = 0.984, 95 % CI = 0.893-1.084; recessive model: OR = 1.026, 95 % CI = 0.931-1.132). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity or study design, no significantly increased risks were found under all models. When stratified by cancer type, there were no significant cancer risk changes for lung cancer, breast cancer or colorectal cancer when miR-149 T allele was included. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that the miR-149 C>T polymorphism may not contribute to cancer susceptibility.
