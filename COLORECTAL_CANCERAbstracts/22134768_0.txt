Deregulated cell signaling pathways result in cancer development. More than             one signal transduction pathway is involved in colorectal cancer pathogenesis             and progression. Koetjapic acid (KA) is a naturally occurring seco-A-ring oleanene             triterpene isolated from the Sandoricum koetjape stem bark. We report the cellular             and molecular mechanisms of anticancer activity of KA towards human colorectal             cancer. The results showed that KA induces apoptosis in HCT 116 colorectal carcinoma             cells by inducing the activation of extrinsic and intrinsic caspases. We confirmed             that KA-induced apoptosis was mediated by DNA fragmentation, nuclear condensation             and disruption in the mitochondrial membrane potential. Further studies on the             effect of KA on cancer pathways show that the compound causes down-regulation             of Wnt, HIF-1α, MAP/ERK/JNK and Myc/Max signaling pathways and up-regulates the             NF-κB signaling pathway. The result of this study highlights the anticancer potential             of KA against colorectal cancer.
