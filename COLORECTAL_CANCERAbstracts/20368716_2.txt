Aurora kinases are conserved eukaryotic serine-threonine kinases, which serve as key regulators of mammalian mitosis. Several studies revealed a distinct correlation between inaccurate chromosome segregation, leading to chromosomal number instability, cancer progression and poor outcome. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of Aurora kinases A (AURKA) and B (AURKB) with overall survival (OS) by quantifying gene expression analysis and evaluation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human colorectal cancer samples and assessing the associations with clinicopathological features. We evaluated intratumoral gene expression levels and SNPs of AURKA and -B from 41 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Patients with a high expression level of AURKB (>1.28) lived significantly shorter (n=11, median OS=6.4 months, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.0-14.5 months) compared with patients with a low expression level (â‰¤ 1.28) (n=30, median OS=18.4 months, 95% CI: 14.7-27.8 months, P=0.026, Wald's test). Patients harboring any G-allele in AURKB 885A>G showed a significantly decreased OS (P=0.05, log-rank test). We did not find any associations with clinicopathological variables and AURKA gene expression levels. Our results suggest a potential role for AURKB inhibition in patients with mCRC; thereby supporting its potential role as a target in mCRC.
