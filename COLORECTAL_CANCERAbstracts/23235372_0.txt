The work is based on an analysis of 95 clinical observations of patients with primary and metastatic liver disease who were in the surgical department of tumors of the liver and pancreas of the State Research Institute named by N.N. Blokhin of RAMS from 1990 to 2011. All patients underwent two or more liver resections. Of all 95 patients included in this study, 64 underwent repeated interventions over a liver colorectal metastases. 10 patients had the operations, which were performed for primary hepatocellular carcinoma of the liver. In 21 patients re-resection were performed for metastatic lesions of other tumor nosology. Postoperative mortality in tumor lesions of the liver in patients who underwent repeat resection was 1.05%, postoperative complications occurred in 38.9% of patients. All patients with colorectal liver metastases who underwent repeat resection of various sizes, five-year survival rate was 53.3Â±8.8%. Median 35.9 months. The low level of mortality and acceptable level of postoperative complications in patients re-operated liver tumor, as well as high rates of long survival confirm the thesis about the need for such interventions as part of combined treatment of this difficult group of patients.
