The prognosis of patients with advanced colorectal cancer with icterus is dismally poor, and adequate chemotherapy for these patients has not been established yet. A 59-year-old male with fatigue, anorexia and icterus with serum total bilirubin 9.7 mg/dL was referred to our institution. He was diagnosed with advanced sigmoid colon cancer with multiple liver metastases. A biopsy specimen of the primary tumor showed well-differentiated adenocarcinoma without KRAS mutation. Since biliary drainage was impossible due to diffuse liver metastases, we initiated combination chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, Leucovorin, oxaliplatin (modified FOLFOX6) and cetuximab. The doses of 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin were reduced, but cetuximab was administered at the standard dosage. After 3 courses of chemotherapy, total bilirubin dropped to 0.8 mg/dL. No significant toxicity other than grade-2 skin toxicity and neuropathy was observed, and the patient has continued chemotherapy on an outpatient basis. Combination chemotherapy with mFOLFOX6 plus cetuximab was effective and feasible in this case of metastatic colon cancer with icterus due to diffuse liver metastasis.
