Current US FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies targeting the EGF receptor (EGFR) include cetuximab and panitumumab. In this article, we discuss the clinical evidence concerning the use of monoclonal antibodies targeting the EGFR in the setting of advanced colorectal cancer and the emergence of predictive molecular biomarkers. In addition, we also consider the evidence surrounding the evolution of anti-EGFR-resistance mechanisms evoked by targeted anti-EGFR therapy and potential therapeutic strategies that may counteract resistant tumor growth.
