 BACKGROUND: Phosphatase of regenerating liver-3 (PRL-3) is an oncogene known to promote tumour metastasis, especially in colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we demonstrate that the miR-21, miR-17 and miR-19a expressions induced by PRL-3 are involved in the proliferation and metastasis of colon cancer. METHODS: Microarray analysis and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR) were used to investigate the changes in miRNA expression due to the overexpression of PRL-3. Transwell chamber invasion assays, CCK-8 proliferation assays and RNA interference assays were used to explore the effects of PRL-3 on miR-21, miR-17 and miR-19a expression in colon cancer cells. Immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR were performed in colon cancer tissues to evaluate the expression of PRL-3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), miR-21, miR-17 and miR-19a. RESULTS: Our study demonstrated that the overexpression of PRL-3 in colon cancer cells induced the expression of miR-21, miR-17 and miR-19a by activating STAT3. Subsequently, these microRNAs contributed to the increased proliferation and invasiveness of the colon cancer cells. Positive correlations between PRL-3 and these microRNAs were also observed in matched primary colon cancer tissues and metastatic lesions. CONCLUSION: miR-21, miR-17 and miR-19a induced by PRL-3 contribute to the proliferation and invasion of colon cancer.
