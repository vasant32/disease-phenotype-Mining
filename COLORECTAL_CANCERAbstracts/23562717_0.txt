BACKGROUND: The matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) can degrade various components of the extracellular matrix and its functional genetic polymorphism may be associated with cancer development. The common MMP-7 (-181A>G) genetic polymorphism has been reported to be functional and may contribute to genetic susceptibility to cancers. However, the association between MMP-7 (-181A>G) and cancer risk remains inconclusive. METHODS: To better understand the role of MMP-7 (-181A>G) polymorphism in global cancer, we conducted this comprehensive meta-analysis encompassing 6392 cases and 7665 controls. RESULTS: Overall, the MMP-7 (-181A>G) polymorphism was associated with higher cancer risk. In the stratified analyses, significant associations were found between the MMP-7 (-181A>G) polymorphism and gastric cancer, ESCC and gynecologic cancer. We also observed that the GG genotype might modulate colorectal cancer risk comparing with the AA genotype (OR=1.31[1.02-1.69]). Moreover, a significantly increased cancer risk was found among Asian populations. When stratified by study design, significantly elevated susceptibility to cancer was found among population-based studies. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that the MMP-7 (-181A>G) genetic polymorphism may contribute to the susceptibility of cancers, especially among Asian population.
