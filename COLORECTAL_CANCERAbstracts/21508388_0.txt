 BACKGROUND: Integrins influence tumourigenesis, tumor progression and development of metastases. The impact of polymorphisms in integrin genes on relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) for 433 Caucasian patients with colorectal cancer was analysed in this retrospective study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Cox regression model including integrin genotype, age, grading, tumour size, number of lymph nodes examined, number of metastatic lymph nodes, stage and application of fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy was used to estimate their effect. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 41 months for RFS and 55 months for OS, no significant correlation between the ITGA2 1648A allele (RFS p=0.618, OS p=0.604), the ITGA2 807T allele (RFS p=0.603, OS p=0.807) and the ITGB3 176C allele (RFS p=0.719, OS p=0.261) and survival was detectable. CONCLUSION: The investigated integrin polymorphisms are not associated with RFS or OS in colorectal cancer patients.
