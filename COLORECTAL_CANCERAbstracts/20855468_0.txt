 BACKGROUND: asparagine-glycine-arginine-human tumour necrosis factor (NGR-hTNF), an agent selectively damaging the tumour vasculature, showed a biphasic dose-response curve in preclinical models. Previous phase I trials of NGR-hTNF indicated 0.8 and 45 μg/m(2) as optimal biological and maximum-tolerated dose, respectively. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two sequential cohorts of 12 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients who had failed standard therapies received NGR-hTNF 0.8 or 45 μg/m(2) in combination with capecitabine-oxaliplatin (XELOX). RESULTS: Median number of prior treatment lines was 3 in the low-dose and 2 in the high-dose cohort. Overall, 21 patients had been pretreated with oxaliplatin-based regimens. No grade 3-4 NGR-hTNF-related toxicities were observed. Grade 1-2 chills were reported in 43% and 40% of cycles in the low-dose and high-dose cohorts, respectively. In the low-dose cohort, one patient achieved a partial response and five had stable disease for a median of 4.6 months. In the high-dose cohort, six patients had stable disease for a median of 3.6 months. Three-month progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 50% and 33% in the low-dose and high-dose cohort, respectively. Three patients in low-dose cohort experienced PFS longer than PFS on last prior therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Both NGR-hTNF doses were safely combined with XELOX in pretreated CRC patients. Hint of activity was apparent only with low-dose NGR-hTNF.
