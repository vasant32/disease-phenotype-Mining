This paper evaluates a recent study whereby a four-drug combination regimen adding bevacizumab to triplet fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and irinotecan chemotherapy is described for the first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. It extends the use of intensive medical treatments combining chemotherapy and the VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab, opening new perspectives for the design of four-drug intensive regimen-associating chemotherapy and targeted agents. In the future, these four-drug intensive regimens should be further improved for efficacy:toxicity ratio and verification in randomized trials.
