As deregulation of miRNAs and chemokine CCL20 was shown to play a role in colorectal cancer (CRC) pathogenesis, we analyzed the functional interactions of candidate miRNAs with CCL20 mRNA. After target prediction software programs indicated a role for miR-21 in CCL20 regulation, we applied the luciferase reporter assay system to demonstrate that miR-21 functionally interacts with the 3'UTR of CCL20 mRNA and down-regulates CCL20 in miR-21 mimic transfected CRC cell lines (Caco-2, SW480 and SW620). Thus, regulation of CCL20 expression by miR-21 might be a regulatory mechanism involved in progression of CRC.
