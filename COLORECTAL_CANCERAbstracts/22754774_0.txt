Expression or release of immunosuppressive molecules may protect tumor cells from the recognition and destruction by the immune system. New findings indicate that colorectal tumors produce immunoregulatory glucocorticoids and thereby suppress immune cell activation. The nuclear receptor LRH-1 plays a critical role in the regulation of colorectal tumor proliferation and glucocorticoid synthesis.
