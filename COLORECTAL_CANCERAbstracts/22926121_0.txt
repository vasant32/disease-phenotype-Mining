 BACKGROUND/AIMS: The role of dietary risk factors in colorectal carcinogenesis remains unclear. We investigated the association between dietary intakes and colorectal adenomas who visited a health promotion center for a routine health check-up colonoscopy. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study using data from individuals who had colonoscopy at Seoul National University Hospital Healthcare System Gangnam Center from October 2003 to December 2007. The subjects were 242 patients (162 males and 80 females) with histopathologically confirmed colorectal adenoma, and 464 (272 males and 192 females) controls. Dietary data were obtained via 24 hour dietary recall, assisted by a registered dietitian. The student's t-test and the chi-square test were performed for the statistical comparison of means and proportions among groups. Multivariate analyses using logistic regression were performed to assess the relation between dietary intake and colorectal adenoma. RESULTS: The total average energy intake of the patients (male: 2,407.5±429.2 kcal, female: 1,901.3±316.9 kcal) was higher than the controls (male: 2,249.6±430.4 kcal, female: 1,752.4±275.0 kcal; p=0.001). High energy intake (male: OR=4.13, 95% CI=1.70-10.05, p=0.002; female: OR=4.00, 95% CI=1.51-10.61, p=0.005) and animal protein intake (male: OR=3.97, 95% CI=1.66-9.49, p=0.002; female: OR=5.76, 95% CI=1.99-16.169, p=0.001) were found to be associated with the risk of colorectal adenoma after adjusting for confounders such as age, BMI, waist circumference, metabolic syndrome and smoking. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, high energy intake and animal protein were associated with colorectal adenoma.
