Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was initially believed to be secreted exclusively by the embryo with its primary function being "rescue" of the corpus luteum. However, recently it has been found that the hormone (or its individual subunits) is also secreted by many cancers and that in many cases secretion is associated with poor patient prognosis. In this study, we assessed the presence of hCG in colorectal cancer cells (CCL-253) and evaluated the anti-tumour effects of anti-hCG antibodies in vitro and in vivo. Anti-hCG antibodies were reactive with CCL-253, as revealed by confocal immunoflourescence microscopy; both cell surface and intracellular expression were observed. Western blot analysis showed that antibodies appeared to interact with several moieties, indicating a level of cross-reactivity. Anti-hCG antiserum specifically reduced the viability of tumor cells and the addition of complement increased in vitro anti-tumor effects. In nude mice implanted with CCL-253 cells, administration of anti-hCG antiserum caused a significant reduction in tumor volume; all treated animals survived, while mortality was observed in control animals. Results suggest that anti-hCG antibodies can mediate significant anti-tumor activity both in vitro and in vivo and lend support to the rationale of anti-hCG immunization in the therapy of gonadotropin- sensitive cancers.
