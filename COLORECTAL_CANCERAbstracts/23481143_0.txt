OBJECTIVES:Constipation is common in the community, and may affect survival adversely. An association between constipation and development of colorectal cancer (CRC) could be one possible explanation. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis examining this issue.METHODS:We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EMBASE Classic (through July 2012). Eligible studies were cross-sectional surveys, cohort studies, or case-control studies reporting the association between constipation and CRC. For cross-sectional surveys and cohort studies, we recorded number of subjects with CRC according to the constipation status, and for case-control studies, number of subjects with constipation according to CRC status were recorded. Study quality was assessed according to published criteria. Data were pooled using a random effects model, and the association between CRC and constipation was summarized using an odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI).RESULTS:The search strategy identified 2,282 citations, of which 28 were eligible. In eight cross-sectional surveys, presence of constipation as the primary indication for colonoscopy was associated with a lower prevalence of CRC (OR=0.56; 95% CI 0.36-0.89). There was a trend toward a reduction in odds of CRC in constipation in three cohort studies (OR=0.80; 95% CI 0.61-1.04). The prevalence of constipation in CRC was significantly higher than in controls without CRC in 17 case-control studies (OR=1.68; 95% CI 1.29-2.18), but with significant heterogeneity, and possible publication bias.CONCLUSIONS:Prospective cross-sectional surveys and cohort studies demonstrate no increase in prevalence of CRC in patients or individuals with constipation. The significant association observed in case-control studies may relate to recall bias.Am J Gastroenterol advance online publication, 12 March 2013; doi:10.1038/ajg.2013.52.
