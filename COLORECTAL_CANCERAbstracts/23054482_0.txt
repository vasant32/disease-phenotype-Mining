The aim of the study was to examine utilization of chaplain services among Veterans Affairs patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2009, the Cancer Care Assessment and Responsive Evaluation Studies questionnaire was mailed to VA CRC patients diagnosed in 2008 (67 % response rate). Multivariable logistic regression examined factors associated with chaplain utilization. Of 918 male respondents, 36 % reported utilizing chaplains. Chaplain services were more likely to be utilized by patients with higher pain levels (OR = 1.017; 95 % CI = 0.999-1.035), younger age (age OR = 0.979; 95 % CI = 0.964-0.996), and later cancer stage (early stage OR = 0.743; 95 % CI = 0.559-0.985). Chaplain services are most utilized by younger, sicker patients.
