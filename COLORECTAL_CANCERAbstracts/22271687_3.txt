The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT signaling pathways interact at multiple nodes in cancer, including at mTOR complexes, suggesting an increased likelihood of redundancy and innate resistance to any therapeutic effects of single pathway inhibition. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of combining the MAPK extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK)1/2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244) with the dual mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibitor (AZD8055). Concurrent dosing in nude mouse xenograft models of human lung adenocarcinoma (non-small cell lung cancers) and colorectal carcinoma was well tolerated and produced increased antitumor efficacy relative to the respective monotherapies. Pharmacodynamic analysis documented reciprocal pathway inhibition associated with increased apoptosis and Bim expression in tumor tissue from the combination group, where key genes such as DUSP6 that are under MEK functional control were also modulated. Our work offers a strong rationale to combine selumetinib and AZD8055 in clinical trials as an attractive therapeutic strategy.
