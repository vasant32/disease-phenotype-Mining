 BACKGROUND: Inequalities in cancer screening are little studied in Asian societies. We determined whether area and individual measures of socio-economic status (SES) affected cancer screening participation in Singapore and prospectively evaluated an access-enhancing community-based intervention. METHODS: The study population involved all residents aged >40 years in two housing estates comprising of owner-occupied (high-SES area) and rental (low-SES area) flats. From 2009 to 2011, non-adherents to regular screening for colorectal/breast/cervical cancer were offered free convenient screening over six months. Pre- and post-intervention screening rates were compared with McNemar's test. Multi-level logistic regression identified factors of regular screening at baseline; Cox regression analysis identified predictors of screening post-intervention. RESULTS: Participation was 78.2% (1081/1383). In the low-SES area, 7.7% (33/427), 20.4% (44/216), and 14.3% (46/321) had regular colorectal, cervical and breast cancer screening respectively. Post-intervention, screening rates in the low-SES area rose significantly to 19.0% (81/427), 25.4% (55/216), and 34.3% (74/216) respectively (p<0.001). Area SES was more consistently associated with screening than individual SES at baseline. Post-intervention, for colorectal cancer screening, those with higher education were more likely to attend (p=0.004); for female cancer screening, the higher-income were less likely to attend (p=0.032). CONCLUSIONS: Access-enhancing community-based interventions improve participation among disadvantaged strata of Asian societies.
