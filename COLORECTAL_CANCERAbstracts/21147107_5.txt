 BACKGROUND & AIMS: Effective and selective treatment options are needed for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). The CD24 mucin-like glycoprotein is overexpressed in CRCs; monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against CD24 inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Based on the tumor-specific expression of CD24, we investigated the potential of anti-CD24 SWA11 mAb, to deliver a cytotoxic agent into CRC cells. METHODS: We conjugated SWA11 to a Pseudomonas exotoxin derivative (PE38) via an Fc-binding ZZ domain from Staphylococcal protein A (which binds the Fc domain of mouse IgG2a immunoglobulins) to generate the immunotoxin SWA11-ZZ-PE38; IgG-ZZ-PE38 was used as control. Human HT-29 and COLO320 (CD24-positive) and HCT116 (CD24-negative) CRC cell lines were assayed for immunotoxin binding, cytotoxicity, viability, and apoptosis. Toxicity and antitumor efficacy were tested in mice. RESULTS: The immunotoxin preserved the affinity and specificity of SWA11, bound and selectively killed CD24-expressing CRC cells via apoptosis. IC(50) values ranged from 20 to 50 ng/mL-several orders of magnitude lower than that of the mAb alone. The immunotoxins were not toxic to mice at the maximum dose of 0.75 mg/kg. Growth of HT-29 xenograft tumors was significantly reduced in mice given SWA11-ZZ-PE38 (by 78%) compared to untreated mice. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-CD24 SWA11 mAb can deliver a PE exotoxin derivative to CRC cells and cause them to undergo apoptosis, without toxicity to normal tissues. This immunotoxin might be developed as a therapeutic treatment for patients with CRC.
