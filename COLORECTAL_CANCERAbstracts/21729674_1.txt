 BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown that colorectal cancer runs a more severe course in blacks compared with whites. Black patients tend to have more advanced disease at diagnosis and are more likely to die of cancer than are white patients. The present study was carried out to compare the characteristics and outcomes of colon cancer in blacks and whites in a Veterans Affairs Medical Center, where patients are expected to receive similar treatment irrespective of race. METHODS: The database of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center was searched for all patients with a histologic diagnosis of colon cancer diagnosed since 1996. Detailed information on patient and tumor characteristics was obtained. In addition the type of treatment and outcome was analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 300 subjects were included in the study. They comprised 205 white and 95 black patients. There was no difference in age at presentation between the 2 groups. Blacks were more likely to have anemia (P = .005) and rectal bleeding (P < .001) than were whites. However there was no difference between the 2 groups with respect to the histologic grade of the tumor, the extent of disease at presentation, the proportion of patients receiving curative surgery, and the time to death after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: There was no racial difference in the treatment outcome of colon cancer in patients treated at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center. These findings indicate that if patients receive similar treatment, the racial background of an individual does not have any impact on the severity of disease at presentation and the outcome of treatment.
