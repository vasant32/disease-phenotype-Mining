 OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of gemcitabine based chemotherapy in heavily pre-treated patients with advanced colorectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients, who had been treated with gemcitabine 1250-2000 mg/m² biweekly in combination with capecitabine 1700-2000 mg/m²/day, d1-7 every two weeks were retrospectively reviewed. All the patients had previously received at least three chemotherapy regimens and 12 (55%) had also received a 4th line regimen. All the patients had been treated with a monoclonal antibody either against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) or endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) (only if wild-type KRAS). The patients had had blood tests weekly, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level measurement every 4 weeks and radiological assessment of their disease with CT scans every 8/9 weeks. RESULTS: Twenty two patients were included; male-female, 14:8; age ranged from 43-73 years. The majority of the patients (17/22) had performance status (PS) ECOG 0-1 and the remaining patients (5/22) had PS 2 at the time of initiation of the gemcitabine-based regimen. Thirteen patients demonstrated a clinical benefit (2 partial response, 2 minor response, 9 stable disease), 6 patients progressed and 2 were not evaluable. CONCLUSION: Gemcitabine has a modest activity in heavily pre-treated colorectal cancer patients and may be an option in good performance status patients.
