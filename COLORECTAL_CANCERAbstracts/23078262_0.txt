 PURPOSE: To review the literature on the interventions used in the promotion of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in the Hispanic population. ORGANIZING CONSTRUCT: CRC screening and Hispanic Americans. METHODS: Literature published between 1999 and 2010 was reviewed using PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus, and Cochrane Library using the key words colorectal cancer, colorectal cancer screening, and Hispanic Americans. FINDINGS: The studies reviewed highlighted various methods of culturally appropriate CRC screening promotion in Hispanic Americans. All studies showed an increase in fecal occult blood test (FOBT) completion and to some degree an improvement in overall CRC knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: The need for increased CRC screening and awareness studies in the Hispanic population is apparent. Future studies should use colonoscopy, a more sensitive test, to better evaluate CRC screening outcomes in Hispanics. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Participation in isolated studies involving FOBT does not necessarily lead to long-term understanding of CRC and the appropriate screening needed, hence the need for ongoing CRC education and promotion in primary care.
