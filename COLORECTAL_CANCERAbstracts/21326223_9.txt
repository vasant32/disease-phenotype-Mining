 OBJECTIVES: Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and a major cause of cancer-related deaths. Early detection of colonic lesions can reduce the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer. Colonoscopy is the screening test for colorectal cancer with the highest efficacy, but its acceptance in the general public is rather low. To identify suitable tumor-derived markers that could detect colorectal cancer in blood samples, we analyzed the methylation status of a panel of genes in sera of affected patients. METHODS: Using methylation-specific quantitative PCR, we analyzed the methylation of ten marker genes in sera of healthy individuals and patients with colorectal cancer. RESULTS: Only HLTF, HPP1/TPEF, and NEUROG1 DNA methylation was detectable in at least 50% of patients with colorectal cancers. Whereas HLTF and HPP1/TPEF preferentially detected advanced and metastasized colorectal cancers, NEUROG1 methylation was detectable in UICC stages I-IV at a similar rate. Compared with other methylation markers, such as ALX4, SEPT9, and vimentin, NEUROG1 shows a higher sensitivity for colorectal cancer at UICC stages I and II. At a specificity of 91%, NEUROG1 reached a sensitivity of 61% (confidence interval, 50.4-70.6%) for the detection of colorectal cancers. Furthermore, detection of NEUROG1 methylation was independent of age and gender. CONCLUSIONS: Methylation of the NEUROG1 gene is frequently found in sera of patients with colorectal cancers independent of tumor stage. The quantitative detection of NEUROG1 DNA methylation in serum is a suitable approach for the non-invasive screening for asymptomatic colorectal cancer.
