 AIM: Abdominoperineal resection for rectal cancer is associated with higher rates of local recurrence and poorer survival than anterior resection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of conventional abdominoperineal resection in a large national series. METHOD: The study was based on the Danish National Colorectal Cancer Database and included patients treated with abdominoperineal resection between 1 May 2001 and 31 December 2006. Follow up in the departments was supplemented with vital status in the Civil Registration System. The analysis included actuarial local and distant recurrence, and overall and cancer-specific survival. Risk factors for local recurrence, distant metastases, overall survival and cancer-specific survival were identified using multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A total of 1125 patients were followed up for a median of 57 (25-93) months. Intra-operative perforation was reported in 108 (10%) patients. The cumulative 5-year local recurrence rate was 11% [95% confidence interval (CI), 7-13)], overall survival was 56% (95% CI, 53-60) and cancer-specific survival was 68% (95% CI, 65-71). Multivariate analysis showed that perforation, tumour stage and nonradical surgery were independent risk factors for local recurrence; tumour fixation to other organs, perforation and tumour stage were independent risk factors for distant metastases; and risk factors for impaired overall survival and cancer-specific survival were age, tumour perforation, tumour stage, lymph node metastases and nonradical surgery. CONCLUSION: Intra-operative perforation is a major risk factor for local and distant recurrence and survival and therefore should be avoided.
