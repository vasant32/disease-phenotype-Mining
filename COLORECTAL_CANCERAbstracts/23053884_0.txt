 BACKGROUND: Colonoscopy is widely used to detect colorectal cancer and to remove precancerous lesions to reduce the risk of colonic cancer. AIMS: To examine the benefits and limitations of cap-fitted colonoscopy compared to conventional colonoscopy in terms of technical performance and colorectal adenoma detection rate. METHODS: Screening colonoscopies performed from 2009 to 2010 with or without a transparent cap were retrospectively examined to compare the rate of successful intubation, cecal intubation time, and number, size, shape, and location of adenomas detected. An inclusion criterion was visualization of >95 % of the right colon. RESULTS: Data from 2,301 colonoscopies (1,165 with cap-fitted colonoscopy, 1,136 without the transparent cap) were retrospectively analyzed. Procedures were performed by four experienced endoscopists. The subjects' demographic characteristics and technical performances were similar between the two methods. The only significant difference in the technical performance between the two techniques was a shorter cecal intubation time with cap-fitted colonoscopy (5.3 vs. 6.6 min; p = 0.045) by one endoscopist. The total number of adenomas detected was significantly higher with cap-fitted colonoscopy than without the cap (586 vs. 484, respectively; p < 0.0001). Adenoma detection with cap-fitted endoscopy was significantly higher in the right colon than in the left colon (19 vs. 12 %, respectively; p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Cap-fitted colonoscopy did not improve the technical aspects of colonoscopy but significantly increased adenoma detection, especially in the right colon. It did not increase the detection rate of flat or depressed adenomas.
