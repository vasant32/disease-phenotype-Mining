 OBJECTIVE: To identify novel multi-drug resistance-related genes, and to explore the mechanisms of multi-drug resistance. METHODS: Multi-drug resistant cell line Lovo/5-FU was established by incubation with increasing dose of 5-FU. The sensitivity to 5-FU and cis-diaminodichloroplatinum (CDDP) was measured by MTT assay. Two dimensional electrophoresis plus mass spectrum(2-DE/MS) was used to identify the differentially expressed protein between Lovo and Lovo/5-FU. The identified protein was then verified by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: The IC50 concentrations of Lovo/5-FU to 5-FU and CDDP were increased by 31 and 3 times, compared with Lovo (both P<0.01). 2DE-MS showed that CAP-G and RhoGDI2 were up-regulated, whereas 6-PGL, DCI, Prdx-6 and Maspin were down-regulated in Lovo/5-FU. Western blot analysis confirmed that the expression levels of RhoGDI2 and CAP-G in Lovo/5-FU were increased by 6.14 and 2.98 fold respectively (both P<0.01), whereas Maspin was decreased to 5.2% of Lovo(P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Multi-gene and multi-pathway are involved in the development of multi-drug resistance of colorectal cancer cells. CAP-G, RhoGDI2 and Maspin are potential multi-drug resistant genes.
