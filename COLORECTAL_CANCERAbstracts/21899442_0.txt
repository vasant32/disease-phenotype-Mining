8-Oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) is one of the important base excision repair enzymes that repair 8-oxoguanine lesion incorporated within the DNA of an individual by reactive oxygen species. The aim of this study was to detect the role of OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism in susceptibility to colorectal cancer (CRC) in a Kashmiri population. We investigated the genotype distribution of the OGG1 gene in 114 CRC cases in comparison with 200 healthy subjects. There was no significant association between OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism and CRC, but the homozygous Cys/Cys variant genotype was associated with an increased risk of colon cancer (p<0.05). This study suggests that the OGG1 polymorphism is not associated with the risk of development of CRC in the Kashmiri population in general but modulates the risk of cancer development in colon via interaction with many dietary factors.
