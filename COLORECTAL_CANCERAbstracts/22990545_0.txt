 UNLABELLED: This study aim was to identify the relations between tumor suppressor genes (p53, bcl-2, PTEN), nuclear proliferative antigen Ki-67 and epidemiologic, morphologic and histologic patient related factors, in colorectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two prospectively collected colorectal cancer resection specimens were histologically prepared, using standard paraffin-embedded and Hematoxylin-Eosin staining method; for immunohistochemical study, the Streptavidin-Biotin (sABC)/Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) method was used. RESULTS: P53 was positive in 86.36% of cases, more intense (>50%) in rectal cancer and in women 59.16 ± 9.49-year-old; the G1/2 adenocarcinoma was dominant. Bcl-2 was positive in 18.18% of the cases, in distal colorectal cancer, only in men, 63.5 ± 13.2-year-old. PTEN was positive in 95.45% of the cases; intense positivity was recorded in 12 men and six women, 61.47 ± 11.67-year-old, in rectal topography. Ki-67 was positive in 86.36% of the cases, more intense in four men and four women, 63.45 ± 12.22-year-old, in proximal and advanced colorectal cancers (pT3N1/2 - 62.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Tumor suppressor genes mutations are often present in colorectal cancer; the intensity of the expression of these mutations varies, which could explain the different prognosis for these patients.
