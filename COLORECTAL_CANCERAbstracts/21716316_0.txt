Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence increases with age, and early onset of the disease is an indication of genetic predisposition, estimated to cause up to 30% of all cases. To identify genes associated with early-onset CRC, we investigated gene expression levels within a series of young patients with CRCs who are not known to carry any hereditary syndromes (n=24; mean 43 years at diagnosis), and compared this with a series of CRCs from patients diagnosed at an older age (n=17; mean 79 years). Two individual genes were found to be differentially expressed between the two groups, with statistical significance; CLC was higher and IFNAR1 was less expressed in early-onset CRCs. Furthermore, genes located at chromosome band 19q13 were found to be enriched significantly among the genes with higher expression in the early-onset samples, including CLC. An elevated immune content within the early-onset group was observed from the differentially expressed genes. By application of outlier statistics, H3F3A was identified as a top candidate gene for a subset of the early-onset CRCs. In conclusion, CLC and IFNAR1 were identified to be overall differentially expressed between early- and late-onset CRC, and are important in the development of early-onset CRC.
