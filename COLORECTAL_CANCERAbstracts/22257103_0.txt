Increased oxidative stress and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity have been reported in cancer, but their relationship with chemotherapy remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to examine wether the chemotherapy treatments used in colorectal cancer had an additional effect on oxidative stress and on IDO activity. Plasma samples were collected from 27 colorectal cancer patients on cytostatic treatment, 27 with cytostatic drugs plus monoclonal antibodies (cytostatic-Mabs) and 15 non-treated patients. All patients with colorectal cancer had high plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), thioredoxin (Trx) levels, and elevated IDO activity in plasma (IDOp) and in dendritic cells (IDOc). This study shows that treatment with cytostatics have an effect on oxidative stress by increasing MDA levels and by decreasing Trx levels and IDO activity. However, treatment with cytostatic-Mabs showed no effect on MDA levels but decreased Trx levels, and the IDO activity showed values similar to the healthy group. Significant correlations between plasma IDO activity and the levels of Trx (r = 0.2062, p < 0.05) and MDA (r = 0.2873, p < 0.005) were observed. Furthermore, our study suggests that IDO activity measured as kynurenine levels could be used as a marker of the response to the chemotherapy treatments, although further studies are necessary.
