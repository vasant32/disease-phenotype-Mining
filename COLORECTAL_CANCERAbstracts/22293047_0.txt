 INTRODUCTION: Our study aim was to evaluate the perioperative events, postoperative events and survival after a second liver resection due to colorectal liver metastases (CLM), compared with a matched control group that had only undergone primary liver resection due to CLM. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective review of charts from patients having undergone a second liver resection due to CLM. A control group was identified by selecting the first liver resection due to CLM occurring after a second resection due to CLM. Twenty-four patients were hereby included in both the primary resection group (PRG) and the second resection group (SRG). The groups were compared statistically with regard to demographics, primary tumour and hepatic involvement. RESULTS: No significant differences between the groups were noted in terms of perioperative events, although there was a trend towards PRG resections involving more liver segments than SRG resections (p = 0.08). The rate of postoperative surgical complications was 17.4% in the PRG and 4% in the SRG (p = 0.18). The admission time was 10.6 days in the PRG and 8.4 days in the SRG (p = 0.71). 30-day mortality was 4% in the PRG and 0% in the SRG (p = 0.41). The five-year survival was 36% in the PRG and 42% in the SRG (p = 0.17) CONCLUSION: This study shows that a second hepatic resection due to recurrent CLM is safe and feasible. It also shows that patients undergoing a second liver resection due to CLM have five-year survival rates comparable to those of patients who have only undergone one hepatic resection due to CLM.
