 BACKGROUND: Zonulin is a newly discovered protein that has an important role in the regulation of intestinal permeability. Our previous study showed that probiotics can decrease the rate of infectious complications in patients undergoing colectomy for colorectal cancer. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the effects of the perioperative administration of probiotics on serum zonulin concentrations and the subsequent effect on postoperative infectious complications in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. DESIGN: A total of 150 patients with colorectal carcinoma were randomly assigned to the control group (n = 75), which received placebo, or the probiotics group (n = 75). Both the probiotics and placebo were given orally for 6 d preoperatively and 10 d postoperatively. Outcomes were measured by assessing bacterial translocation, postoperative intestinal permeability, serum zonulin concentrations, duration of postoperative pyrexia, and cumulative duration of antibiotic therapy. The postoperative infection rate, the positive rate of blood microbial DNA, and the incidence of postoperative infectious complications-including septicemia, central line infection, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and diarrhea-were also assessed. RESULTS: The infection rate was lower in the probiotics group than in the control group (P < 0.05). Probiotics decreased the serum zonulin concentration (P < 0.001), duration of postoperative pyrexia, duration of antibiotic therapy, and rate of postoperative infectious complications (all P < 0.05). The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway was inhibited by probiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative probiotic treatment can reduce the rate of postoperative septicemia and is associated with reduced serum zonulin concentrations in patients undergoing colectomy. We propose a clinical regulatory model that might explain this association. This trial was registered at http://www.chictr.org/en/ as ChiCTR-TRC-00000423.
