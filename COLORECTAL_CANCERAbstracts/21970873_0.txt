 BACKGROUND: PROX1 is a specific target of the Î²-catenin/TCF pathway in the intestinal epithelium. It acts as a regulator of progression from a benign to a highly dysplastic phenotype in colorectal tumours. However, the clinical significance of PROX1 expression is not known. METHODS: We studied the prognostic value of immunohistochemical expression of PROX1 in a series of 517 patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). RESULTS: The majority of the tumour samples expressed PROX1 (91%, 471 out of 517). High PROX1 expression was associated with a poor grade of tumour differentiation (P<0.0001). In the subgroup of patients with colon cancer, high PROX1 expression was associated with unfavourable colorectal cancer-specific survival (CCSS) as compared with low PROX1 expression (CCSS 47% vs 62%; P=0.045; RR 1.47). The association between high PROX1 and poor outcome was further strengthened in female colon cancer patients (CCSS 38% vs 63%; P=0.007; RR 2.02). Nonetheless, in multivariate survival analysis PROX1 expression was not retained as an independent prognostic factor. CONCLUSION: High PROX1 expression is associated with a poor grade of tumour differentiation, and, in colon cancer patients, also with less favourable patient outcome. Our results strengthen the previous preclinical observations that PROX1 has a role in tumour progression in CRC.
