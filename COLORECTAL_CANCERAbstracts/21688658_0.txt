The aim of our study was to examine the effect of individual schemes of multimodal analgesia on indicators of immunity and inflammation markers after operations on the colon. Patients of group 1 (n=15) received paracetamol, lornoxicam and epidural ropivacaine, 2nd group of patients (n=15)-paracetamol, epidural ropivacaine and tramadol. Comparison group (n=10) patients underwent patient controlled analgesia by promedol. Before surgery, 1st and 3rd days after surgery we examined the contents of cytokines in plasma: interleukin 12p70, interleukin 10, interleukin 6, and TNF. Before surgery and at 5-7 days after surgery indicators of cellular, fagocytal and humoral immunity were monitored. Before surgery patients with colorectal cancer revealed changes in the indices of different components of immunity, as well as an increase in pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines compared with healthy donors. Multimodal analgesia in patients after operations on the colon is not accompanied by changes in plasma concentrations of cytokines and parameters of immune status in comparison with monoanalgesia by promedol.
