 PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to investigate risk factors associated with prognosis in elderly patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and to determine treatment and follow-up strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CRC patients (age ≥70) who were treated with curative operation were studied. We compared 57 patients whose survival time was less than 2 years with 117 patients with survival time exceeding 5 years, based on the clinical, pathologic, and preoperative clinical laboratory analysis findings. A risk scoring system on basis of factors determined by multiple logistic regression analysis was explored and validated by both receiver operating characteristic and survival analysis. RESULTS: Neuroticism, rural residence, deep layer invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and high serum CEA levels were found to be associated with adverse prognosis in the multivariate logistic regression model. Risk scoring system based on these factors showed that the patients with total score exceeding 2.5 had a significantly poorer prognosis (P < 0.05), which was validated by survival analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with neuroticism, rural residence, deep layer invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and high serum CEA level should be regarded as a high-risk group; a simple scoring system based on these factors could be used to evaluate the risk and facilitate treatment of CRC for elderly patients.
