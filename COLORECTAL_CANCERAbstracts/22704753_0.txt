The Community Preventive Services Task Force (Task Force) recommends increasing screening for breast cancer through use of group education, one-on-one education, client reminders, reducing client out-of-pocket costs, and provider assessment and feedback; increasing screening for cervical cancer through use of one-on-one education, client reminders, and provider assessment and feedback; and increasing screening for colorectal cancer through use of one-on-one education, client reminders, reducing structural barriers to screening, and provider assessment and feedback. The Task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of increasing screening for breast cancer through use of client incentives, mass media, or provider incentives; for cervical cancer screening through use of group education, client incentives, mass media, reducing client out-of-pocket costs, reducing structural barriers, or provider incentives; and for colorectal cancer screening through use of group education, client incentives, mass media, reducing client out-of-pocket costs, or provider incentives. Details of these findings, and some considerations for use, are provided in this article.
