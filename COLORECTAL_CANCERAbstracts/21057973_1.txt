 BACKGROUND: The optimal chemotherapeutic regimen suitable for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients previously treated with 5-fluorouracil (5FU), oxaliplatin, irinotecan and biotherapies remains an unresolved issue. The aim of this study was to evaluate the activity of bevacizumab combined with FOLFIRI-3 in mCRC after failure of prior chemotherapy including fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan and oxaliplatin. METHODS: Patients were treated with bevacizumab in combination with FOLFIRI-3 every 14 days. The association between treatment efficacy and visceral fat area as measured by CT scan or Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) change after 2 months was also studied. RESULTS: Forty-nine consecutive patients were treated. Four hundred and twenty four cycles of chemotherapy were delivered. Median follow-up was 11 months. Eleven patients (22.4%) had an objective partial response and 26 (53.1%) were stabilized. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 7 and 13 months respectively. Four grade 4 adverse events occurred (1 digestive perforation, 1 rectal ulcer, 1 pulmonary embolism, and 1 febrile aplasia) but no toxic death was observed. Grade 3 adverse events occurred in 18 patients (38%) including asthenia in 15 patients (30%), nausea and vomiting in 4 patients (8%), diarrhea in 11 patients (22%), anemia in 4 patients (8%), neutropenia in 10 patients (20%) and thrombopenia in 4 patients (8%). Visceral Fat area was significantly lower in responder patients. CEA change at 2 months predicted improved overall survival. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that bevacizumab combined with FOLFIRI3 may be active in mCRC patients after failure of all classical lines of chemotherapy.
