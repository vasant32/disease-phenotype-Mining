 OBJECTIVES: We studied whether individual socioeconomic and neighborhood factors such as living in a poor community independently affected health screening participation. METHODS: We studied 3 blocks of public-rental flats (the poorer neighborhood) adjacent to 3 blocks of owner-occupied public housing (the better-off neighborhood) in a precinct in Taman Jurong, Singapore. Demographic details and reasons for not having regular hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and colorectal cancer screening were collected from 2009 to 2010. An access-enhancing intervention was implemented in both neighborhoods to raise health screening rates. RESULTS: Participation rates for rental flats and owner-occupied flats were 89.0% (356/400) and 70.2% (351/500) respectively. Living in a better-off neighborhood was independently associated with diabetes mellitus (66% vs. 35%, adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=2.12, p<0.01), hyperlipidemia (53% vs. 26%, AOR=4.34, p<0.01) and colorectal cancer screening (17% vs. 6%, AOR=15.43, p<0.01), as were individual socioeconomic factors such as employment, need for financial aid and household income. Uptake of all screening modalities significantly increased in the poorer neighborhood post-intervention (all p<0.05). Cost was cited more commonly as a barrier to health screening in the poorer neighborhood. CONCLUSION: Differing neighborhoods within one geographical location, as well as individual socioeconomic factors, were independently associated with differences in health screening.
