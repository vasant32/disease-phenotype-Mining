 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of casein kinase 2β in esophageal carcinoma tissues and analyze its clinical significance. METHODS: The expression of CK2β in a tissue chip containing 60 normal esophageal mucosa and 60 colorectal cancer specimens were detected immunohistochemically. Ten human esophageal carcinoma and adjacent normal tissues were examined for the expression of CK2β protein and mRNA using Western blotting and real-time quantitative PCR, respectively. RESULTS: A strong expression of CK2β was found in 85.71% of the esophageal cancer tissues; 1.79% of the cancer tissues were negative for CK2β expression, and 1.79% and 10.71% of the cancer tissues were weakly and moderately positive, respectively. In the normal mucosal tissues, 96.67% of the tissues were negative for CK2β and 3.33% showed weak CK2β expression, showing a significant difference in the distribution of CK2β between normal and esophageal carcinoma tissues (P<0.001). The expression level of CK2β in esophageal cancers was associated with the pathological stage (TNM) (P=0.010). Western blotting and real-time quantitative PCR also confirmed an increased CK2β expression in the esophageal cancer tissues. CONCLUSION: The high expression of protein kinase CK2β is closely related to the carcinogenesis and malignancy of esophageal cancer.
