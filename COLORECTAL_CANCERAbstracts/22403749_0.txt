 PURPOSE: Various studies searching for biomarkers to predict tumor metastasis or prognosis in both esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are currently underway. However, few data have been reported on its association with colorectal cancer (CRC). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common known form of human genetic variation and may contribute to an increased susceptibility to cancer including CRC. The present study aimed to investigate whether the polymorphisms in the CTTN gene are associated with susceptibility to CRC in the Korean population. METHODS: A case-control study was performed to examine the relationship between the CTTN g.-9101C>T, g.-8748C>T, and g.72C>T polymorphisms and the risk of CRC. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of g.-8748C>T, g.-9101C>T and Taqman analysis of g.72C>T were performed on blood samples from 218 patients with CRC and 533 control individuals. The g.-9101C>T, g.-8748C>T, and g.72C>T SNPs in CTTN and their haplotypes were analyzed. RESULTS: The genotype and allele frequencies of g.-9101C>T, g.-8748C>T, and g.72C>T did not differ between the patient group and the control group. Further, the haplotype of CTTN g.-9101C>T, g.-8748C>T, and g.72C>T did not differ between patient group and the control group. However, the genotype and allele frequencies of CTTN g.-9101C>T were significantly increased in the lymph node positive CRC group compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: The CTTN g.-9101C>T polymorphism may influence lymph node positive CRC.
