 INTRODUCTION: We sought to adapt and evaluate the FLU-FOBT Program for a primary care clinic serving a low-income Chinese American community. METHODS: We compared colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) rate changes for patients who received flu shots versus those who did not receive flu shots during the FLU-FOBT Program. Analysis of data from the year prior to the intervention was used to validate the results. RESULTS: Rates of CRCS increased by 18.0 percentage points for flu shot recipients during the FLU-FOBT Program vs. 1.7 percentage points for flu shot non-recipients (p<.001 for change difference). In the year prior to the FLU-FOBT Program, flu shot recipients had only a 3.3 percentage point increase in the CRCS rate vs. a 1.9 percentage point decline for flu shot non-recipients (p=.08 for change difference). CONCLUSIONS: The FLU-FOBT Program as adapted was effective at increasing CRCS rates for primary care patients in this low-income Chinese American community.
