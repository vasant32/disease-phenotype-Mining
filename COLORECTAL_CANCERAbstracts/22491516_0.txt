Since the recognition of Lynch syndrome, which confers a high risk of colorectal, uterine, and other cancers, approaches to its diagnosis have included a family history of associated cancers and web-based algorithms. Identification of causative genes now allows a precise diagnosis, thus focusing present efforts on who should have genetic testing. Testing for cancer tissue changes can determine who should have germline genetic testing. Indeed, such tumor testing is now generally recommended for all newly diagnosed colorectal cancer cases. As reported in this issue of the journal by Yurgelun and colleagues (beginning on page 574), large colorectal adenomatous polyps (â‰¥10 mm) from patients with Lynch syndrome exhibit findings similar to those in Lynch syndrome colorectal cancer tissues. This finding indicates that testing larger adenomas in persons at a significant risk for Lynch syndrome can now determine the need for germline genetic testing. Although further study is needed for general application, the present study justifies large polyp testing in high-risk families when cancer tissue is unavailable, albeit negative polyp tissue would not rule out Lynch syndrome, as would negative cancer tissue.
