PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH: This paper is a report of a study of the experiences of individuals with colorectal cancer in the period following their cancer treatment and the physical, psychological and social aspects associated with adjusting to everyday life. METHODS AND SAMPLE: Qualitative interviews using a phenomenological approach were conducted with a purposive sample of 13 individuals who had completed active curative treatment for colorectal cancer. RESULTS: Study findings suggest that colorectal cancer survivors employ a broad range of techniques and approaches to manage adjustment to everyday life such as goal-setting, managing informal networks and adopting strategies for physical and emotional recovery. Personal interests were used to create a sense of meaning and through the cultivation of altruistic and utilitarian outlooks on life, positive emotional gains were obtained. CONCLUSIONS: Colorectal cancer survivors employ personal strategies for managing life in the survivorship period following cancer treatment. The study findings demonstrate additional areas for exploration such as the effect of altruism on adjustment and the relationship to other groups of cancer survivors.
