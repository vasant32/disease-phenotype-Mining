Immune thrombocytopaenia (ITP) was referred to previously as idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura and is usually of autoimmune or viral aetiology. Colorectal cancer liver metastasis with concomitant ITP is rare and only three cases have been reported in the English literature. Adverse effects of adjuvant chemotherapy may aggravate ITP. The sequencing of chemotherapy, operation for the primary and liver metastasis, and a decision on splenectomy is important. We present our experience in the management of a 52-year-old man who, having undergone anterior resection one year earlier for carcinoma of the rectum, presented with liver metastasis and ITP. He underwent splenectomy with hepatectomy prior to chemotherapy.
