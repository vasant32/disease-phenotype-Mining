 PURPOSE: More people are living with and beyond a cancer diagnosis and new models of care are required which not only help cancer survivors meet their needs after cancer treatment but also offer guidance on how they might optimize their future quality of life. METHODS: 'Reach for recovery' is a programme of educational group support which was designed specifically for colorectal cancer patients on completion of treatment. This new initiative consisted of weekly sessions offering group support and information to promote recovery from treatment and transition into cancer survivorship. The first two programmes constituted a pilot study and were evaluated to inform future content and development. RESULTS: A total of seventeen patients participated in the first two programmes. Completed evaluations (n = 13) revealed that the content of the programme was perceived to be beneficial, the sessions were rated as informative and relevant to individual needs and participants had enjoyed meeting others in a similar situation. While nearly all eligible patients expressed interest in the programme, less than half of those invited attended more than one session. Establishing the resources for the programme and recruiting participants to the programme proved resource-intensive and this may limit its sustainability. CONCLUSION: This initiative was well received by both cancer survivors and clinicians and offered both support and education at a critical transition time in colorectal cancer patients entry into survivorship. Careful consideration must be given to the programme venue, frequency and timing for the successful delivery of such initiatives.
