PURPOSE: This study investigated the expression pattern of PTEN and its effect on carcinogenesis of ulcerative colitis-associated colorectal cancer, leading to insights into the underlying molecular mechanism. METHODS: We established a mouse model of ulcerative colitis-associated colorectal cancer by treating the animals with azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulphate sodium (DSS), and investigated the inflammation-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence. Expression patterns of PTEN, p-Akt and Ki-67 were shown by immunohistochemistry; western blotting techniques were used to detect protein expression of PTEN, p-Akt and caspase 3; TUNEL assay was used to measure apoptosis in colon epithelial cells; and colorimetric analysis was able to determine MPO activity in colon tissues. RESULTS: During the inflammation-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence, PTEN expression gradually decreased, while p-Akt expression increased; PTEN and p-Akt levels were negatively correlated. Compared to the AOM-DSS and Ad-0 groups, Ad-PTEN mice had longer colons, fewer tumours (P < 0.01) and smaller tumour sizes (P < 0.05). After injecting Ad-PTEN, expression of p-Akt, Ki-67 and MPO activity decreased dramatically, whereas PTEN increased. The TUNEL assay showed increased apoptotic cells and caspase 3 expression in the Ad-PTEN group. CONCLUSION: PTEN plays an important role in the inflammation-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence and may be a new molecular target in preventing and treating ulcerative colitis-associated colorectal cancer.
