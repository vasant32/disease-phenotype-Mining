 AIM: To explore the value of serum M2-pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) in colorectal cancer (CRC) mass screening. METHODS: We conducted a molecular epidemiology study in Hangzhou, China, from year 2006 to year 2008. Serum samples were collected from 93 CRC, 41 advanced adenomas, 137 adenomas, 47 non-adenomatous polyps, and 158 normal participants in a community setting. Serum M2-PK and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were measured using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. SPSS 16.0 software was used to perform data analysis. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificities were estimated for serum M2-PK in diagnosis of colorectal lesions and compared with CEA. RESULTS: Average serum M2-PK value among 158 normal people was 2.96 U/mL and not affected by gender (P = 0.47) or age (P = 0.59). Average serum M2-PK (U/mL) was 14.75 among stage III and 13.10 among stage I and II CRC patients, about 4 times higher than that among normal people. Average serum M2-PK was 8.58, 6.70, 5.13 and 2.51 U/mL among advanced adenoma, adenomas, non-adenomatous polyps, and inflammatory bowel disease patients, respectively. AUC for serum M2-PK was greater than that for CEA among all colorectal lesions. AUC for serum M2-PK was 0.89 (0.84, 0.94) (95% confidence interval), higher than that for CEA [0.70 (0.62-0.79)] in CRC stage I and II, 0.89 (0.84-0.94) vs 0.73 (0.63-0.83) in CRC stage III, 0.81 (0.74-0.86) vs 0.63 (0.53 - 0.73) in advanced adenomas, 0.69 (0.64-0.76) vs 0.54 (0.47-0.60) in adenomas, and 0.69 (0.62-0.78) vs 0.58 (0.48-0.68) in non-adenomatous polyps. The diagnostic sensitivity for all colorectal lesions increased with decrease in the cut-off value of serum M2-PK. The diagnostic sensitivity (%) of serum M2-PK was 100.00 for CRC, 95.12 advanced adenoma, 82.48 adenoma, and 82.98 non-adenomatous polyp. There were no CRC cases missed and 40.51% of unnecessary colonoscopies were avoided when the cut-off value was 2.00 U/mL. CONCLUSION: Serum M2-PK can be used as a primary screening test in CRC mass screening. It may be a promising non-invasive biomarker for CRC early detection.
