 AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of ADAMTS12 in colorectal cancer progression and to examine whether ADAMTS-12 can be considered as a prognostic indicator for colorectal cancer. METHODS: This study was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded resected specimens obtained from 112 patients with colorectal cancer. The expression level of ADAMTS12 was investigated by immunohistochemical staining to assess the relationship between ADAMTS12 expression and the clinicopathologic factors and to study the prognostic significance of ADAMTS12 in colorectal cancer patients. RESULTS: ADAMTS12 expression was mainly localized in the fibroblasts adjacent to the tumor cells or in macrophages in front of the invasive cancer margins. The ADAMTS12 expression was significantly correlated with the tumor histological grade, depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, and Dukes' stage. Patients with low or no ADAMTS12 expression in the tumor stroma had a significantly poor overall survival or disease-free survival. CONCLUSION: The expression of ADAMTS12 in colorectal cancer stroma plays an important role in inhibiting tumor development. Patients with ADAMTS12 expression showed better prognosis than those without ADAMTS12 expression. Thus, ADAMTS12 expression may be a good prognostic marker for colorectal cancer.
