Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is an enzyme that mediates post-translational             modification of proteins. Seventeen known members of the PARP superfamily can             be grouped into three classes based on catalytic activity: (i) classical poly(ADP-ribose)             polymerases, (ii) mono(ADP‑ribosyl) transferases and (iii) catalytically inactive             members. PARP6 belongs to the mono(ADP-ribosyl) transferase class, and here we             have found that PARP6 is a negative regulator of cell proliferation. Forced expression             of PARP6 in HeLa cells induced growth suppression, but a PARP6 mutant with a C-terminal             deletion lacking the catalytic domain had no effect. The PARP6-expressing cells             accumulated in the S-phase, and the magnitude of S-phase accumulation was observed             to be greater in cells expressing a PARP6 mutant with an N-terminal deletion,             lacking a putative regulatory domain. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that             PARP6 positivity was found at higher frequencies in colorectal cancer tissues             with well-differentiated histology compared to those with poorly differentiated             histology. Furthermore, PARP6 positivity negatively correlated with the Ki-67             proliferation index. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that PARP6-positive colorectal             cancer had a good prognosis. Based on these results, we propose that PARP6 acts             as a tumor suppressor through its role in cell cycle control.
