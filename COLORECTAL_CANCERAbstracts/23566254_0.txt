The prognostic value of mucin expression has been reported in several studies. We examined the association between mucin expression and other previously reported prognostic factors, including infiltration of CD10(+) myeloid cells (iCD10), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) expression, and tumor budding at invasion fronts. Immunohistochemical analysis of 206 colorectal samples was performed to determine whether MUC1, MUC2, MUC4, and MUC5AC expression could predict the survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Serial sections were stained for CD10, TGF-β1, and pan-cytokeratin in order to detect tumor budding. As per multivariate analyses, MUC1 expression appeared to be the most significant predictor of both recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival. On the other hand, MUC4 was only significant to predict RFS and MUC5AC could be a good marker in stage IV CRCs which required additional chemotherapy. MUC1 (CD227) expression was associated with iCD10, TGF-β1 expression, and tumor budding grade. These findings suggest that MUC1 is indicative of poor prognoses that may be associated with immunosuppression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, MUC1 expression appears to be a chemoattractant for CD10(+) stromal cells.
