 AIM: The study of the anticancer effects of destruxin B (DB) is rare and its anticancer mechanism remains unknown. The aim of this study was to test the in vitro and in vivo anticancer effects of DB, on human HT-29 colorectal cancer (CRC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: DB was isolated and characterized by high pressure liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to assess the effects of DB on HT-29 cells in vitro. The anticancer effects of DB were investigated in a murine xenograft model of human colon cancer. RESULTS: A significant inhibition of cell viability was observed with DB treatment in time- and dose-dependent manners. DB administered subcutaneously daily at 0.6-15 mg/kg was proven to be safe and effective in inhibiting the growth of CRC cells. Expression of Bax, cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and active caspase-3 were observed with DB treatment and the increase in tumor volumes of treated groups were significantly (p<0.05) lower than those of the mock-treated group. CONCLUSION: DB has potential as a new therapeutic agent against human CRC.
