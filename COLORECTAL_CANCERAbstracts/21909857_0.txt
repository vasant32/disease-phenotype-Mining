 BACKGROUND: Self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) are used for colorectal obstruction preoperatively and palliatively. Limited data on the use of stents for obstruction caused by extracolonic malignancies exist, and the results are unclear. Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SEMS for patients stented as a bridge to surgery and as palliation for colorectal cancer or extracolonic malignancies. METHODS: Between 1998 and 2009, a total of 101 patients underwent 108 stenting procedures for malignant colorectal obstruction. The results were studied retrospectively. RESULTS: Of the study cohort, 11 patients were stented as a bridge to surgery. For palliatively stented patients, the etiology of obstruction was colorectal cancer in 66 patients and extracolonic malignancy in 24. Overall technical success was 99% and clinical success 88%. Complications occurred for 20 (20%) patients in 22 of 108 procedures. Complications included perforation (n = 6), recurrent obstruction (n = 8), and stent migration (n = 4). A median time to complication was 81.5 days. The overall stent placement-related mortality was 2/101 (2%). For patients stented as a bridge to surgery, a primary anastomosis in elective operations was achieved for 90% (9/10). In the palliation groups, patients with colorectal cancer had significantly higher clinical success rates than patients with extracolonic malignancies (94% vs. 65%, P = 0.0005). There was no difference in complications, operation, and stoma rates between the palliation groups. CONCLUSIONS: SEMS is a safe and effective treatment for patients stented as a bridge to surgery or as palliation due to colorectal cancer. Stents are also useful in relieving obstruction due to extracolonic malignancies, but the clinical failure rate is higher than for colorectal cancer.
