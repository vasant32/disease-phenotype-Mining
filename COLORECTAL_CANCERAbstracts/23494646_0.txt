BACKGROUND: Fujifilm has developed a novel endoscope system with two kinds of lasers that enables us to allow narrow-band light observation with blue laser imaging (BLI). The aim of this study was to evaluate BLI magnification in comparison with narrow-band imaging (NBI) magnification for the diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms. METHODS: This was a multicenter open study. A total of 104 colorectal neoplasms were examined with BLI and NBI magnifications in Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine and Fukuoka University Chikushi Hospital. Vascular and surface patterns of tumors under BLI magnification were compared with those under NBI magnification, using a published NBI classification. The main outcome was the correlation between the NBI classification diagnosed by BLI or NBI magnification and the histopathological analyses. RESULTS: Sixty-two cases of adenoma, 34 cases of intramucosal cancer and shallowly invaded submucosal cancer, and eight cases of deeply invaded submucosal cancer were diagnosed. The diagnostic accuracy of BLI magnification in the NBI classification was 74.0 % (77/104), similar to that of NBI magnification (77.8 %). The consistency rate between BLI and NBI magnification in the NBI classification was 74.0 %. Concerning image evaluation, the interobserver variability of two expert endoscopists (N.Y. and T.H.) in BLI magnification was κ = 0.863. On the other hand, the intraobserver variability of the two endoscopists was κ = 0.893 (N.Y.) and 0.851 (T.H.). CONCLUSIONS: BLI magnification by laser source could predict histopathological diagnosis and invasion depth of colorectal neoplasms. The diagnostic effectiveness of this method was similar to that of NBI magnification.
