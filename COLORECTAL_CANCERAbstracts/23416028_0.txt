OBJECTIVE: To describe the procedures of the colorectal cancer screening program in the Basque Country (Spain), and the main results of the first rounds in 2009-2011. METHOD: We carried out a retrospective study of invitations to attend screening between 2009 and 2011. Participation rates and the number of positive results of the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) were analyzed by sex and age group. RESULTS: There were 235.371 valid invitations (sent to the correct addresses), with an average participation rate of 64.3% (95%CI: 64.1-64.5%). Significant differences were found (p<0,001) between women (67.1%; 95%CI: 66.9-67.4) and men (61.4%; 95%CI: 61.1-61.7). The rate of positive FOBT results was higher (p<0,001) among men (9.1%; 95%CI: 8.9-9.2) than among women (4.8%; 95%CI: 4.7-4.9). CONCLUSIONS: Participation rates were adequate compared with those in the reviewed literature. These rates were probably affected by the invitation strategy and by cultural and social factors.
