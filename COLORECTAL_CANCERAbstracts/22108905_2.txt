 BACKGROUND: Interleukin-8 (IL-8) also referred to as CXCL8, a member of the CXC chemokine family that attracts neutrophils and other leukocytes, has been associated with cancer. Angiogenesis is a prime regulator of tumour expansion and data support that IL-8 is a potent angiogenic factor. Epigenomic instability has been postulated to play a role for the development of multiple neoplasias including colorectal cancer (CRC). DNA methylation of cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides leads to transcriptional silencing of associated genes. METHOD: In this study, we comparatively analysed the protein expression of IL-8 in plasma, tumour and paired normal tissue and methylation status of the IL-8 gene to evaluate its impact on CRC. RESULTS: Collectively, by using Luminex technology, we noted a significantly higher IL-8 level in cancer tissue compared to paired normal tissue and that CRC patients exhibit significantly higher plasma levels than healthy controls. Analysed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, we detected IL-8 hypomethylation in 64% of the cancerous tissue cases but no hypomethylation was found in paired normal tissue. We noted that the CRC patients with IL-8 hypomethylation revealed a significant higher level of IL-8 protein in cancerous tissue, which tended to be associated with distant metastasis. We also observed that patients with distant metastasis showed a significantly higher plasma level of IL-8 in relation to patients without distant metastasis. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the predominance of high plasma levels of IL-8 in patients with distant metastasis in combination with the hypomethylation of the IL-8 promoter region might be a useful marker of the disease advancement.
