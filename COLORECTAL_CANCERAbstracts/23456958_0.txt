Adjuvant fluoropyrimidine-based (5-FU) chemotherapy is a mainstay of treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC), but only provides benefit for a sub-set of patients. To improve stratification we examined (for the first time in CRC), whether analysis of GRP78 expression provides a predictive biomarker and performed functional studies to examine the role of GRP78 in sensitivity to 5-FU. 396 CRC patient samples were collected in a prospective uniform manner and GRP78 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays using a well-validated antibody. Expression was correlated with clinicopathological parameters and survival. The role of GRP78 in 5-FU sensitivity was examined in CRC cells using siRNA, drug inhibition and flow cytometry. GRP78 expression was significantly elevated in cancer tissue (P<.0001), and correlated with depth of invasion (P=.029) and stage (P=.032). Increased overall 5-year survival was associated with high GRP78 expression (P=.036). Patients with stage II cancers treated by surgery alone, with high GRP78 also had improved survival (71% v 50%; P=.032). Stage III patients with high GRP78 showed significant benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy (52% v 28%; P=.026), whereas patients with low GRP78 failed to benefit (28% v 32%; P=.805). Low GRP78 was an independent prognostic indicator of reduced overall 5-year survival (P=.004; HR=1.551; 95%CI 1.155-2.082). In vitro, inhibition of GRP78 reduces apoptosis in response to 5-FU in p53 wild-type cells. GRP78 expression may provide a simple additional risk stratification to inform the adjuvant treatment of CRC and future studies should combine analysis with determination of p53 status.
