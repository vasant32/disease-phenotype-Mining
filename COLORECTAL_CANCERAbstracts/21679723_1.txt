 OBJECTIVE: To examine whether a racial difference exists in self-reported recommendations for colorectal cancer screening from a health care provider, and whether this difference has changed over time. METHOD: Secondary analysis of the 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008 Maryland Cancer Surveys, cross-sectional population-based random-digit-dial surveys on cancer screening. Participants were 11,368 White and 2495 Black Maryland residents age â‰¥ 50 years. RESULTS: For each race, recommendations for colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy increased over time (67%-83% for Whites, 57%-74% for Blacks; p<0.001 for both), but the race difference remained approximately 10% at each survey. Among respondents without a colonoscopy in the last 10 years (n=5081), recommendations for fecal occult blood test (FOBT) in the past year decreased over time for Whites (37%-24%, p<0.001) and for Blacks (36-28%, p=0.05), with no difference by race in any year. In multivariable analysis, the effect of race on the odds of reporting a provider recommendation did not vary significantly across time for either test (p=0.80 for colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy, p=0.24 for FOBT for effect modification by year). CONCLUSION: Whites were more likely than Blacks to report ever receiving a provider recommendation for colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy. Although the proportion of patients receiving recommendations for colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy increased over time, the gap between races remained unchanged.
