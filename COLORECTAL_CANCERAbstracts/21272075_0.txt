The incidence of colorectal adenomas and advanced neoplasia in the transplant population has not been well characterized. The aim of this study was to determine whether or not there was an increased incidence of colorectal adenomas and advanced neoplasia in solid organ transplantation (SOT) recipients compared with an average-risk population. We reviewed 360 patients with solid organ transplants who underwent colonoscopy between February 1995 and July 2008, and 360 age- and gender-matched patients in an average-risk population. The mean duration from transplantation to colonoscopy in the SOT group was 40.4 Â± 34.0 months. Ninety-three (25.8%) adenomas were detected in the SOT group, while 98 (27.2%) adenomas were detected in the control group (p = 0.763). There was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.0001) in the number of patients with advanced neoplasia in the SOT group (24 patients [6.7%]) compared with the control group (3 patients [0.8%]). The independent risk factors of advanced neoplasia were old age (odds ratio [OR], 1.067; 95% CI, 1.019-1.118) and transplantation (OR, 6.069; 95% CI, 1.455-25.314). In summary, there was a significant increase in the incidence of advanced colorectal neoplasia in SOT recipients. The reason for this finding is unclear, and studies with a larger number of patients are needed to further evaluate this group.
