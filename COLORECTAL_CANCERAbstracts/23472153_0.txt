 BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence has suggested that Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 7 (SMAD7) rs12953717 polymorphism might be related to cancer risk. However, epidemiologic findings have been inconsistent. We therefore performed a meta-analysis to clarify the association between the SMAD7 rs12953717 polymorphism and cancer risk. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted to identify all eligible studies of SMAD7 rs12953717 polymorphism and cancer risk. We used odds ratios (ORs) to assess the strength of the association, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to give a sense of the precision of the estimate. Heterogeneity, publication bias, and sensitivity analysis were also explored. RESULTS: A total of 14 case-control studies, including 16928 cases and 14781 controls, were included in the present meta-analysis. The overall results showed that the variant genotypes were associated with a significantly increased risk of all cancer types (homozygote comparison, OR = 1.23, 95%CI = 1.10-1.38, P<0.01; heterozygote comparison, OR = 1.12, 95%CI = 1.02-1.22, P = 0.02; recessive model, OR = 1.17, 95%CI = 1.07-1.29, P<0.01; dominant model, OR = 1.15, 95%CI = 1.06-1.25, P<0.01; allelic model, OR = 1.12, 95%CI = 1.06-1.18, P<0.01). Further sensitivity analysis confirmed the significant association. In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, SMAD7 rs12953717 polymorphism was significantly associated with cancer risk in both Caucasians and Asians. In the subgroup analysis by cancer types, SMAD7 rs12953717 polymorphism was significantly associated with colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our investigations demonstrate that rs12953717 polymorphism is associated with the susceptibility of cancer. Large-scale and well-designed case-control studies are necessary to validate the risk identified in the present meta-analysis.
