 BACKGROUND/AIMS: The advantages of combined pharmacological and physical methods for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis after colorectal surgery have not been clearly determined. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of fondaparinux combined with intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) with IPC alone for VTE prophylaxis after resection for colorectal cancer. METHODOLOGY: Between June 2008 and March 2010, 137 consecutive patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) who underwent colorectal resection in our surgical unit were enrolled in the study. Patients were divided into 2 groups. The IPC group was treated with IPC alone as controls. The fondaparinux group was treated with IPC and received subcutaneous injections of fondaparinux once daily. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of fondaparinux combined with IPC with IPC alone for VTE prophylaxis. RESULTS: The demographic variables and risk factors, operating time, blood loss and length of the postoperative hospital stay were similar in the two groups. No clinically evident VTE, critical bleeding, and postoperative death occurred during the study period. No adverse reactions due to fondaparinux were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing resection of colorectal cancer, receiving fondaparinux and IPC thromboprophylaxis was highly effective, well tolerated and safe. The use of combined modalities for VTE prophylaxis is justified in patients at high risk of VTE.
