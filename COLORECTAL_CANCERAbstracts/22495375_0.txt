A large amount of DNA of high quality is essential for molecular analysis. The amount of DNA in routine paraffin sections is small. Surgical specimens retained in formalin for the long-term (several months) left over from the sampling required for wax embedding can be referred to as "long-term formalin-fixed" specimens, and clearly this material is a rich source of DNA; however, it is difficult to extract. In the current study, we designed a microwave-heating method for DNA extraction from these specimens. We found that the heating procedure achieved greater DNA yields than a common nonheating method used for comparison (DNA contents mean±SD, heating 2.16±0.95 μg/μL vs. common 1.75±0.90 μg/μL, P<0.05). Fluorescence multiplex polymerase chain reaction-capillary electrophoresis successfully detected microsatellite instability (MSI) in the DNA samples derived from this heating procedure (98.4%, 689 of 700 sample tests), at significantly higher levels than from the conventional method (82.3%, 247 of 300 sample tests, P<0.05). We identified 10 (14.3%) MSI with high frequency and 6 (8.6%) MSI with low frequency colorectal cancers. MSI with high frequency cancers showed distinct clinicopathologic features including higher incidence of right-sided location, high histologic grade, mucin-production, and prominent intraepithelial lymphocyte infiltration. We concluded that the microwave-heating method was efficient for DNA isolation from long-term formalin-fixed tissue samples. The successful fluorescence multiplex polymerase chain reaction-capillary electrophoresis analysis in these samples might facilitate MSI detection in clinical practice.
