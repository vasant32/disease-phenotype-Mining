Summary: At a simplistic level, colorectal cancer arises from mutations in various proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Aside from genetically inherited factors, environmental, lifestyle, and dietary habits have all been identified as risk agents promoting mutational events leading to the development of colorectal cancer. This "In Focus" presents evidence that the intestinal endogenous bacterial community represents a risk factor for the development of colorectal cancer. Cancer Discov; 3(4); 384-7. Â©2013 AACR.
