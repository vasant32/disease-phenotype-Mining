Two new and large molecular rectangles 4 and 5 were synthesized from two different arene-ruthenium [Ru(2)(μ-η(4)-C(2)O(4))(MeOH)(2)(η(6)-p-Pr(i)C(6)H(4)Me)(2)][O(3)SCF(3)](2) (2), and [Ru(2) (p-cymene)(2) (donq) (OH(2))(2)] [O(3)SCF(3)](2) (donq = 5,8-dioxydo-1,4-naphthaquinonato) (3) acceptors and a new unsymmetrical N-(4-(pyridin-4-ylethynyl)phenyl) isonicotinamide (1) donor ligand. X-ray crystallography of 4 confirmed a molecular rectangle. The (1)H NMR spectra of both rectangles 4 and 5 showed a mixture of two structural, head-to-tail (HTL) and head-to-head (HTH) type, isomers in a 1:1 ratio. The cytotoxicities of both rectangles have been established against Colo320 (colorectal cancer), A549 (lung cancer), MCF-7(breast cancer) and H1299 (lung cancer) human cancer cell lines. The cytotoxicity of rectangle 5 was found to be considerably stronger against all cancer cell lines than that of the reference drug cisplatin.
