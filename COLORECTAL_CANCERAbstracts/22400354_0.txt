Colorectal cancer is the second most frequent cancer at death and third most common neoplasm in Switzerland, with about 1600 deaths and 4000 new cases per year, respectively. This study describes the recent trends in colorectal polyps and cancers in the canton of Vaud where a rare population-based series on polyps has been available since 1983. The most salient results are the exponential increase in the detection rates of polyps since the late 1980s, associated with a doubling in the proportion of right-sided polyps, whereas colorectal cancer incidence remained constant over the last 25 years. The apparent paradox between the strong increase in detection and resection of polyps, largely due to screening activity, and the absence of reduction in colorectal cancer incidence in the Vaud population is discussed.
