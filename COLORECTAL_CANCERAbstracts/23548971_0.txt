Background: A Japanese postmarketing survey of panitumumab revealed that panitumumab-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD) occurred in approximately 1% (19/1767) of patients, causing death in 36.8% of these cases. Case Report: We report the case of a 60-year-old Japanese man who developed ILD associated with panitumumab therapy (third-line therapy) for metastatic sigmoid colon cancer involving the liver, lymph nodes, and lungs. 2 months after the initiation of panitumumab therapy, he developed a progressive nonproductive cough, dyspnea, and a fever, and was diagnosed with ILD. Intravenous pulse methylprednisolone treatment led to quick recovery. The patient had some risk factors for ILD associated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Conclusion: Further studies are required to elucidate the association between anti-EGFR antibodies and ILD.
