The homeodomain transcription factor CDX2 directs development and maintenance of normal intestinal epithelium. However, the role of CDX2 in colorectal carcinogenesis is poorly understood. Hence, we investigated the CDX2 expression in patients with colorectal cancer and its relationship to tumor cell proliferation and differentiation and evaluated the role of this molecule as a biologic marker for the prediction of poor patient survival. We retrospectively reviewed 207 patients with colorectal cancer, with an available paraffin block, who underwent surgical resection between January 2002 and December 2004 at Korea University Guro Hospital. CDX2 expression was compared between tumor tissue and the adjacent normal mucosa using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Immunohistochemical staining for CDX2, Ki-67, and CK20 was performed in each tumor tissue. Immunohistochemistry revealed that CDX2 protein is overexpressed by colorectal cancer compared with adjacent normal mucosa (P < 0.001). In the Western blot analysis, tumor tissue showed a trend toward overexpression of CDX2 protein compared with normal mucosa (P = 0.09). CDX2 expression showed a significant direct correlation with the expression of Ki-67 and CK20 in tumor tissue (P = 0.028 and P = 0.042, respectively). Survival analysis showed that reduced CDX2 expression was statistically and significantly related to poor overall survival. Reduced CDX2 expression is associated with poor overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer and may be clinically useful as a marker for poor prognosis.
