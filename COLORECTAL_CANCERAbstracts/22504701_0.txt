Chemotherapy with bevacizumab(BV)has been one of the standard treatments for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. However, emergent treatments are sometimes required because of severe adverse events associated with it. We experienced a case of massive rectal hemorrhage during BV treatment, and interventional radiology(IVR)successfully controlled it. An 81-year-old male visited our hospital, suffering from local recurrence of rectal cancer. He underwent colostomy for fecal diversion, and chemoradiation therapy was performed. Systemic chemotherapy with XELOX+BV was performed for the residual tumor. On the 27th day after the first administration of BV, the patient was hospitalized because of anal bleeding and a state of shock. The colonoscopic examination showed a dimple caused by tumor shrinkage, which was closed by clipping. However, a state of shock was caused by intermittent hemorrhages again afterwards. The hemorrhagic point was identified as the oral side of the dimple by angiography, and coil embolization led to immediate hemostasis. The colonoscopic examination revealed nothing abnormal besides the dimple. It is therefore suspected that the cause of rectal hemorrhage might be induced by BV. During combination chemotherapy with BV, bleeding is one of the severe adverse events requiring an emergent treatment regardless of BV dose. IVR may be an effective treatment when bleeding can not be controlled by endoscopic hemostasis. Therefore, we should construct a system for emergency hemostasis including IVR.
