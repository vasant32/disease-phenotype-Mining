Nearly 50 % of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients develop liver metastases with liver resection being the only option to cure patients. Residual micrometastases or circulating tumor cells are considered a cause of tumor relapse. This work investigates the influence of partial hepatectomy (PH) on the growth and molecular composition of CRC liver metastasis in a syngeneic rat model. One million CC531 colorectal tumor cells were implanted via the portal vein in WAG/Rij rats followed by a 30 % PH a day later. Control groups either received tumor cells followed by a sham-operation or were injected with a buffer solution followed by PH. Animals were examined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and liver tissues were processed for immunolabeling and PCR analysis. One-third PH was associated with an almost threefold increase in relative tumor mass (MRI volumetry: 2.8-fold and transcript levels of CD44: 2.3-fold). Expression of molecular markers for invasiveness and aggressiveness (CD49f, CXCR4, Axin2 and c-met) was increased following PH, however with no significant differences when referring to the relative expression levels (relating to tumor mass). Liver metastases demonstrated a significantly higher proliferation rate (Ki67) 2 weeks following PH and cell divisions also increased in the surrounding liver tissue. Following PH, the stimulated growth of metastases clearly exceeded the compensation in liver volume with long-lasting proliferative effects. However, the distinct tumor composition was not influenced by liver regeneration. Future investigations should focus on the inhibition of cell cycle (i.e. systemic therapy strategies, irradiation) to hinder liver regeneration and therefore restrain tumor growth.
