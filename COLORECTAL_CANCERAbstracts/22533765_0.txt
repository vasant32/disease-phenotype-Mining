 BACKGROUND AND AIM: Secure manipulation of forceps in endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for colorectal tumors is sometimes hindered by the characteristics of that organ. SB knife Jr, which are scissor forceps using a mono-pole high frequency, were developed to avoid the difficulty of ESD operation in the colorectum. The aim of the present study was to examine the effectiveness of the SB knife Jr in colorectal ESD in 11 hospitals, mostly in northeastern Japan. MATERIALS: One hundred and two colorectal tumors (49 non-granular laterally spreading tumor [LST] lesions, 39 granular LST lesions and 14 other lesions) that were resected by ESD operations using SB knife Jr between October 2009 and March 2010. RESULTS: All tumors (102/102) were resected en bloc and could be observed in detail. The mean size of the resected pieces was 40.3 mm. The mean operation time was 54.2 min. Of the complications, one case of micro-perforation occurred during the manipulation of submucosal dissection, and this case was treated with clips in that operation. The rates of resection carried out only with SB knife Jr were 74.5% (76/102). CONCLUSION: The novel ESD using SB knife Jr in the colorectum offers a breakthrough in resection techniques for not only expert endoscopists but also general endoscopists.
