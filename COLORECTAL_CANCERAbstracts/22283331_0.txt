 BACKGROUND: Hereditary colorectal cancer accounts for approximately 4-5% of all colorectal cancers. The causative genes for familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer are large, making comprehensive analyses difficult. Therefore, high-throughput and practical methods are required to make an early diagnosis of hereditary colorectal cancers and identify high-risk individuals. For this purpose, we developed a novel gene scanning method by high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis. METHODS: High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis is a promising prescreening method for nucleic acid sequence variants because of its high sensitivity and high-throughput capability. We evaluated HRM for screening APC, MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 genes for point mutations, small deletions, and insertions. Simultaneously, we evaluated quantitative polymerase chain reaction-HRM (qPCR-HRM) for screening the MSH2 gene for large rearrangements. RESULTS: All 28 point mutations and 1 large rearrangement were successfully detected by qPCR-HRM analysis. CONCLUSIONS: A fast and reliable mutation detection strategy with HRM and qPCR-HRM was used to diagnose hereditary colorectal cancers. Because this method is simple and economical, it may be useful in diagnostic laboratories.
