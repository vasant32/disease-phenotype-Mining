 OBJECTIVE: To study the expression of Bcl-2 and PD-L1 in colon cancer and its relationship with metastasis. METHODS: Tumor samples were collected from 57 cases of colon cancer, and tumor adjacent normal mucous tissue were obtained as normal control. The expressions of Bcl-2 and PD-L1 were assayed by immunohistochemical staining, and its correlations with patients' clinical pathological indexes were analyzed. RESULTS: The positive rate of Bcl-2 protein was 75.43% and 52.63% in colon cancer tissues and tumor adjacent colon mucous tissue respectively, with statistically significant difference (P<0.05). While the positive rate of PD-L1 was 45.61% and 15.79% in colon cancer tissues and tumor adjacent colon mucous tissue respectively, also with signficant difference (P<0.01). The positive rate of Bcl-2 was correlated with cellular differentiation, and the positive rate of PD-L1 protein was correlated with lymph node metastasis (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The expression of Bcl-2 may be associated with colon cancer pathologic differentiation, and the expression of PD-L1 may be associated with colon cancer metastasis.
