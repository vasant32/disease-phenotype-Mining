A 76-year-old man with colorectal cancer and hepatic metastases was referred to us for radioembolization of the liver. Angiography with 99mTc-MAA SPECT/CT was performed 8 weeks after the discontinuation of bevacizumab. 99mTc-MAA SPECT/CT showed a diffused intrahepatic tracer distribution with no focally accentuated accumulation in the tumorous region. The test was repeated 6 weeks later and Tc-MAA SPECT/CT showed this time a tumor accentuated tracer accumulation in the liver. Subsequently, the patient was treated with resin microspheres. Tc-MAA SPECT/CT allows a better evaluation of intrahepatic tracer accumulation of Tc-MAA and facilitates the determination of the most appropriate treatment time.
