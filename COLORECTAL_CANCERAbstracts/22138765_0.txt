Since tenascin C is a factor expressed highly in the tumor-associated matrix, it would be a desirable first step for targeting the tumor-specific microenvironment. In fact, a high level of tenascin C expression has been reported in most solid tumors, including lung cancer, colon cancer and glioblastoma. Therefore, the targeted binding of tenascin C in tumor stroma would inhibit tumor metastasis by modulating cancer cell growth and migration. We isolated a peptide that bound to tenascin C by phage display peptide library selection, and the selected peptide specifically recognized tenascin C protein in xenograft mouse tissue. We also observed exclusive staining of tenascin C by the selected peptide in tumor patient tissues. Moreover, the peptide reduced tenascin C-induced cell rounding and migration. We propose that the tenascin C targeting peptide may be useful as a specific anti-cancer diagnostic and therapeutic tool for most human solid tumors.
