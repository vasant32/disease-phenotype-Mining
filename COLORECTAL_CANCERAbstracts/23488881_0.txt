BACKGROUND AND AIM: There have been very few reported investigations on the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of intestinal cancer and all cancers other than intestinal cancer with Crohn's disease (CD) by organ in Japan. This study examined the risk of developing cancer (i.e., SIR) that occurs in association with CD. METHODS: The subjects were 770 CD patients managed at our hospital department, which specializes in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), during the approximately 25 years from July 1985 to August 2010. The number of expected cancer patients in a healthy population matched for sex and age with the CD patients in our hospital was then calculated. The relative risk, or SIR, was also calculated. RESULTS: The total observation period was 10,552 person-years, during which 19 cases (2.5%) of cancer were discovered in 770 subjects. The cancer cases included 9 cases of colorectal cancer (CRC), 1 case of small bowel cancer, 1 case of stomach cancer, 3 cases of acute myeloid leukemia, 2 cases of endometrial cancer, 1 case of lung cancer, 1 case of skin cancer, and 1 case of thyroid cancer. The SIR for cancers in Japan in 2003 was 0.87 (95%CI 0.52-1.35) for all cancers, 2.79 (95%CI 1.28-5.29) for CRC, and 6.94 (95%CI 1.43-20.3) for leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Among the cancers in Crohn's disease patients in our hospital, no significant difference was seen in the risk for all cancers in comparison to the standard population. However, the risks for CRC and leukemia were significantly higher than in the standard population.
