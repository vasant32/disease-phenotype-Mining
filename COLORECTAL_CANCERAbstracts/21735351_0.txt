 OBJECTIVE: Changes in splanchnic circulation have been seen in patients with colorectal cancer. We have previously reported that the inferior mesenteric vein is dilated in rectal cancer. We wanted to assess whether the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) is dilated in right-sided colon cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From a colorectal database, three cohorts were formed: right colon cancer, rectal cancer, and normal. The SMV (2 cm proximal to the confluence of the SMV and portal vein) and the gastrocolic trunk (GCT) were saved and anonymized. The short-axis diameter of the vein was measured independently by three radiologists. RESULTS: The diameter of the SMV and GCT was higher in the right colon group than the other two groups. There was no correlation with the stage of tumor (locoregional or metastatic). CONCLUSION: Patients with right colon cancer showed a significantly increased mean SMV diameter at presentation, which may be due to increased venous return secondary to neovascularization. Further studies are required to evaluate this further.
