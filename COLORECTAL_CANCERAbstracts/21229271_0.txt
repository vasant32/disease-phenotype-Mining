 BACKGROUND: Hepatotoxicity represents a frequent chemotherapy-related side effect, often associated with course delays, discontinuations, and dose reductions. S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) administration is effective in the treatment of a variety of liver injuries, but it has never been evaluated in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced damage. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-eight patients affected by metastatic colorectal cancer were enrolled. Forty-two patients were treated with bevacizumab and XELOX without administering AdoMet, 32 were treated with the same regimen plus supplementation with AdoMet. Liver enzymes levels were assessed before starting the treatment, and then every therapy cycle, liver toxicity, chemotherapy course delays, discontinuations, and dose reductions due to liver toxicity were recorded. RESULTS: Aspartate aminotransferase (P = 0.02), alanine transaminase (P < 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (P = 0.008), total bilirubin (P = 0.03), and gamma-glutamyltransferase (P < 0.001) were found to be significantly lower in patients treated with AdoMet than in those who were not. Patients supplemented with AdoMet experimented a lower grade of liver toxicity (P = 0.009) and had a reduced need of course delay (P = 0.042) and dose reduction (P = 0.051). CONCLUSIONS: AdoMet supplementation in patients affected by metastatic colorectal cancer treated with oxaliplatin-based regimen seems to be effective in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced liver injury.
