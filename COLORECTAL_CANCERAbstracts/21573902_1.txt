 PURPOSE: Half of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) have metastasis during the whole course of the disease. Fewer than 10% of those are still alive at 5 years. Locally advanced CRC accounts for 7% to 33% of CRC relapses. Of these, only a small number of patients are resectable with a curative intent. Management of unresectable metastatic or locally advanced CRC is a significant challenge. In this study, we focus on patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic CRC and analyze survival rate and prognostic factors influencing the survival. METHODS: There were 277 patients identified. Several clinicopathologic parameters were evaluated. To determine the prognostic impact of the factors in survival, all parameters were tested from their relationship in Cox-regression model and Cox proportional hazards model. Survival curves were generated according to Kaplan-Meier method and the differences in survival were determined by employing the log-rank test. RESULTS: Three factors that influence the survival were identified: one or more than two organs involved (p = 0.041), higher carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level (p = 0.001), and different salvage treatment (p < 0.001). In Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, there were significant differences between patients with one and more than two organs involved (p = 0.027), different ranges of CEA level (p = 0.004), and different salvage treatment (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We clearly demonstrated three factors that influence the survival, including more than two organs involved, higher CEA level, and different salvage treatment. The higher the CEA level and the more organs (≥2) involved, the worse the survival. Even in patients with unresectable metastatic or locally advanced, aggressive treatment with target therapy seems to have survival benefit.
