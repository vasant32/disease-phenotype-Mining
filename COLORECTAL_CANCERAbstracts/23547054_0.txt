Mutations in KRAS drive the oncogenic phenotype in a variety of tumors of epithelial origin. The NF-κB transcription factor pathway is important for oncogenic RAS to transform cells and to drive tumorigenesis in animal models. Recently TAK1, an upstream regulator of IKK, which controls canonical NF-κB, was shown to be important for chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer and for regulating KRAS+ colorectal cancer cell growth and survival. Here we show that KRAS+ upregulates GSK-3α leading to its interaction with TAK1 to stabilize the TAK1/TAB complex to promote IKK activity. Additionally, GSK-3α is required for promoting critical non-canonical NF-κB signaling in pancreatic cancer cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of GSK-3 suppresses growth of human pancreatic tumor explants, consistent with the loss of expression of oncogenic genes such as c-myc and TERT. These data identify GSK-3α as a key downstream effector of oncogenic KRAS via its ability to coordinately regulate distinct NF-κB signaling pathways.
