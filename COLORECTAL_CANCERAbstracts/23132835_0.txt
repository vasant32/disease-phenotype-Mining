 SCOPE: Low concentrations of folate, other B vitamins, and methionine are associated with colorectal cancer risk, possibly by changing DNA methylation patterns. Here, we examine whether plasma concentrations of B vitamins and methionine are associated with methylation of long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) among those at high risk of colorectal cancer, i.e. patients with at least one histologically confirmed colorectal adenoma (CRA) in their life. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used LINE-1 bisulfite pyrosequencing to measure global DNA methylation levels in leukocytes of 281 CRA patients. Multivariable linear regression was used to assess associations between plasma B vitamin concentrations and LINE-1 methylation levels. Plasma folate was inversely associated with LINE-1 methylation in CRA patients, while plasma methionine was positively associated with LINE-1 methylation. CONCLUSION: This study does not provide evidence that in CRA patients, plasma folate concentrations are positively related to LINE-1 methylation in leukocytes but does suggest a direct association between plasma methionine and LINE-1 methylation in leukocytes.
