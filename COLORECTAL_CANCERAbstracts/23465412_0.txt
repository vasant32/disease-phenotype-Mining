To investigate tissue fatty acid distribution in relation to the incidence of colorectal cancer prognosis, adjacent normal tissue and cancerous tissue from 35 samples of clinically incident colorectal cancer were obtained. Fatty acids were measured in the colorectal mucosa phospholipid fraction by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Palmitoleic acid and oleic acid were significantly lower in colorectal cancerous tissue, ranging from 20% to 50% less than the adjacent normal tissue. The omega-6 (n-6) fatty acid family members (20:2, 20:3, 20:4 and 22:4) were higher by 1-3 fold in cancerous colorectal tissue. Contrary with the high level of n-6 fatty acids, about a 37% to 87% reduction in EPA and DHA was observed in colorectal cancerous tissue. A higher level of linoleic acid and arachidonic acid was detected in the C cancer stage than in the B cancer stage (p<0.05), but a lower level of oleic acid and docosahexenoic acid was detected in the C cancer stage (p<0.05). The fatty acid distribution of colorectal tissue is strongly linked to the incidence of colorectal cancer. This study also provides scientific basis for identifying novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.
