 OBJECTIVE: The association between nutritional status and inflammation was assessed in patients with colorectal cancer and to verify their association with complications during anticancer treatment. The agreement between the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) and different nutritional assessment methods was also evaluated. METHODS: A cross-sectional, prospective, and descriptive study was performed. The nutritional status was defined by the SGA and the severity of inflammation was defined by the Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS). The complications were classified using the Common Toxicity Criteria, version 3. Anthropometric measurements such as body mass index, triceps skinfold, midarm circumference, midarm muscle area, and adductor pollicis muscle thickness were also performed, as were handgrip strength and phase angle. The chi-square test, Fisher exact test, Spearman correlation coefficient, independent t test, analysis of variance, Gabriel test, and κ index were used for the statistical analysis. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Seventy patients with colorectal cancer (60.4 ± 14.3 y old) were included. The nutritional status according to the SGA was associated with the GPS (P < 0.05), but the SGA and GPS were not related to the presence of complications. When comparing the different nutritional assessment methods with the SGA, there were statistically significant differences. CONCLUSION: Malnutrition is highly prevalent in patients with colorectal cancer. The nutritional status was associated with the GPS.
