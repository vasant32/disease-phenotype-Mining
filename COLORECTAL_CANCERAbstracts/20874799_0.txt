 AIM: To present a new biochemistry and haematology outcome model which uses a minimum dataset to model outcome following colorectal cancer surgery, a concept previously shown to be feasible with arterial operations. METHOD: Predictive binary logistic regression models (a mortality and morbidity model) were developed for 704 patients who underwent colorectal cancer surgery over a 6-year period in one hospital. The variables measured included 30-day mortality and morbidity. Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit statistics and frequency tables compared the predicted vs the reported number of deaths. Discrimination was quantified using the c-index. RESULTS: There were 573 elective and 131 nonelective interventional cases. The overall mean predicted risk of death was 7.79% (50 patients). The actual number of reported deaths was also 50 patients (χ(2) = 1.331, df = 4, P-value = 0.856; no evidence of lack of fit). For the mortality model, the predictive c-index was = 0.810. The morbidity model had less discriminative power but there was no evidence of lack of fit (χ(2) = 4.198, df = 4, P-value = 0.380, c-index = 0.697). CONCLUSIONS: The Colorectal Biochemistry and Haematology Outcome mortality model suggests good discrimination (c-index > 0.8) and uses only a minimal number of variables. However, it needs to be tested on independent datasets in different geographical locations.
