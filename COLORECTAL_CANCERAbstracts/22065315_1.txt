 INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to report on the feasibility of integrating 3D preoperative volumetry, portal vein transection and in situ split procedure. A 54-year-old female with now resectable colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) (segments III, IVb, V-VIII) underwent a two-staged procedure. METHODS: Segment III resection, right portal vein transection and an in situ split procedure (first stage) after 3D volumetry based on CT data and a right trisegmentectomy (second stage) were performed. RO resection of metastases was achieved, and the postoperative course was uneventful. CONCLUSION: The proposed strategy seems to be a promising method to achieve higher resectability rates in CRLM patients.
