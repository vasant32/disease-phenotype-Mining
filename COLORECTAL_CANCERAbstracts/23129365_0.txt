Approximately 20 % of patients with colorectal cancer have synchronous liver metastases at the time of diagnosis. In some instances it is difficult to determine the best treatment strategy in these patients. For example, should the primary tumor be removed in those patients with unresectable liver metastases and who do not have any symptoms of the primary tumor? Or which operation should be performed first in patients with rectal cancer and synchronous resectable liver metastases? Unfortunately, there are no clear answers to these questions from prospective randomized trials. In the present article retrospective studies are analyzed in order to define the best possible treatment strategy for patients with synchronous colorectal liver metastases.
