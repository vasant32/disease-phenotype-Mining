Atypical patterns of metastatic spread from colorectal primary tumors are often misdiagnosed, with potential implications for the clinical outcome. Metastatic diffusion to the splanchnocranium is extremely rare in colorectal cancer. A histological proof of diagnosis is rarely obtained and therapeutic management is a challenge. We describe the case of a 46-year-old patient who presented with a radiologically proven sphenoid wing metastasis. The patient presented with left-sided exophthalmos while receiving systemic chemotherapy for relapsed high-risk colorectal cancer. A left sphenoid wing metastasis was proven by a head computed tomography scan. A metastatic spread to the sino-nasal tract is regarded as a poor prognosis determinant in colorectal cancer and presents a unique set of diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The compression of noble structures such as the optic nerve holds serious implications in terms of quality of life but there is insufficient evidence clarifying whether radiotherapy or surgery represent the best option for these patients, leaving the therapeutic plan to be decided case by case.
