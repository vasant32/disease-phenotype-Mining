This study was initiated to identify how physicians inform women about specific side effects of endocrine therapy for early breast cancer. It is recommended that women with early breast cancer receive endocrine treatment for at least 5 years. Although this medication is an important step in curing breast cancer, continued application by patients is far below 100%; 30-50% of all women prematurely end their prescribed therapy. In an online survey, physicians specializing in treating breast cancer (members of the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group, ABCSG) were asked about their practice of informing patients about potential side effects of endocrine therapy for breast cancer. Two hundred and five members of the ABCSG completed the online questionnaire. The physicians indicated that patients were primarily informed regarding joint pain/muscle pain and flushes/sleep disturbances during the initial consultation as well as during the first follow-up visit. Patients were informed considerably less regarding side effects that influence quality-of-life areas, such as pain during intercourse, reduced orgasm capability, and hair loss. During the initial consultation, and during first follow-up visit, patients are not uniformly and are insufficiently informed about substantial side effects of endocrine therapy.
