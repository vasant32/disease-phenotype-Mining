Recently, cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been identified in many types of cancers, such as colorectal cancer (CRC). CSCs seem to be involved in initiation, growth, and tumor metastasis, as well as in radio- and chemotherapy failures. CSCs appears as new biological targets for cancer therapy, requiring the development of noninvasive cell sorting methods. In this study, we used sedimentation field flow fractionation (SdFFF) to prepare enriched populations of CSCs from eight cell lines corresponding to different CRC grades. On the basis of phenotypic and functional characterizations, "hyperlayer" elution resulted in a fraction overexpressing CSC markers (CD44, CD166, EpCAM) for all cell lines. CSCs were eluted in the last fraction for seven out of eight cell lines, but in the first for HCT116. These results suggest, according to the literature, that two different pools of CSCs exist, quiescent and activated, which can both be sorted by SdFFF. Moreover, according to CSC properties, enriched fractions are able to form colonies.
