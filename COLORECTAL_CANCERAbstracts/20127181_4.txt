The human multidrug resistance (MDR1) gene product P-glycoprotein is highly expressed in intestinal epithelial cells, where it constitutes a barrier against xenobiotics, bacterial toxins, drugs and other biologically active compounds, possibly carcinogens. In this study, an association of MDR1 gene polymorphism and the occurrence of colorectal cancer were evaluated. In this case-control-designed 118 unrelated colorectal cancer and 137 sex-and-ages matched healthy controls were enrolled. The C3435T MDR1 gene polymorphism was identified using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Significantly increased frequencies of the 3435T allele and the 3435TT were observed in patients with colorectal cancer compared with controls (P = 0.03; OR, 95% CI; 1.46 for 3435T allele and P = 0.003; OR, 95% CI; 2.2 for 3435TT genotype). In contrast, frequency of genotype TT was significantly higher in controls compared to colorectal cancer (P = 0.006; OR, 95% CI; 0.49 for TC genotype). In this study suggest that C3435T MDR1 polymorphism has an association with colorectal cancer. The results support that the presence of allele C results in decreased susceptibility to colorectal cancer.
