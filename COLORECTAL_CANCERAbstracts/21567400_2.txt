The stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)/CXC receptor 4 (CXCR4) axis has been shown to play a role in colorectal cancer progression. In addition, the protease urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is an important factor in tumor cell invasion and metastasis. However, the mechanism by which SDF-1 mediates uPA expression in human colorectal cancer cells remains unknown. We investigated the molecular mechanism governing the interaction between SDF-1 stimulation and uPA expression in three human colon cancer cell lines (DLD-1, SW48, and COLO 205). We found that SDF-1 stimulation led to an increase in the expression and secretion of uPA in these cells. Experiments involving specific inhibitors and small interfering RNA demonstrated that the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways are critical for SDF-1-induced uPA expression. Analysis of transcription factor binding using ELISA and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that SDF-1 increased Sp1- and AP-1-DNA-binding activities in DLD-1 cells. Inhibition of Sp1 and AP-1 activation blocked the SDF-1-induced expression and activity of the uPA promoter. The effect of SDF-1 on DLD-1 signaling and uPA expression was mediated by the CXCR4/Î²1 integrin axis. In summary, our findings elucidate the mechanisms of SDF-1/CXCR4 downstream signaling and provide insights into the function of SDF-1 in colon cancer cells.
