 AIM: The current study aimed to assess the long-term efficacy of combination therapy with oral S-1, a fluoropyrimidine prodrug, plus irinotecan in previously untreated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between April 2004 and February 2005, 41 patients with previously untreated advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer were enrolled in the study. Chemotherapy consisted of oral administration in S-1 at 40 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1 to 14 and intravenous infusion of irinotecan at 150 mg/m(2) on day 1 in a 21-day cycle. RESULTS: The median patient follow-up was 78.0 months. The median survival time was 23.7 months, and the 2-year survival rate was 50%. The median time to tumor progression was 8.3 months. CONCLUSION: The results of this long-term update confirmed that first-line combination therapy with oral S-1 plus irinotecan was effective in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
