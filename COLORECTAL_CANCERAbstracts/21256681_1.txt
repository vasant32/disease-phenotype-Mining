In view of the high incidence and mortality of the colorectal cancer, the limited efficacy and serious adverse effect of the conventional treatment, a novel alternative treatment needs to be developed. Recent studies have demonstrated that the targeted therapy as an alternative treatment showed a promising prospect. We hypothesized that construct a recombination non-pathogenic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), inserting a fusion gene TAT-Apoptin into this probiotic vector, as a targeted therapy strategy for patients of colorectal cancer. Compared with conventional treatments for tumors, the recombination EcN containing TAT-Apoptin fusion gene is capable of tumor-specific colonization, secretary expression and efficient intracellular delivery and therefore able to reduce the incidence of side effect and promote the efficiency of treatment.
