 BACKGROUND: We previously reported that the one-step nucleic acid amplification assay is effective for lymph node metastasis detection in breast cancer patients. This paper describes the identification of CK19 mRNA as an optimal marker and its cut-off value for use in the detection of one-step nucleic acid amplification-based lymph node metastasis in colorectal cancer patients. METHODS: Candidate mRNA markers selected from the genome-wide expressed sequence tag database were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR using a mixture of metastasis-positive and another mixture of metastasis-negative lymph nodes (n = 5 each), followed by quantitative RT-PCR using metastasis-positive and -negative lymph nodes (n = 10 each) from 20 patients. The one-step nucleic acid amplification assay for mRNA markers selected above was examined using 28 positive lymph nodes from 19 patients and 38 negative lymph nodes from the 11 pN0 patients. RESULTS: Quantitative RT-PCR analyses of the 98 mRNAs selected from the genome-wide expressed sequence tag database and the subsequent quantitative RT-PCR analyses of the nine mRNAs selected above indicated that CK19 and CEA mRNAs have the highest capability for distinguishing between positive and negative lymph nodes. CK19, CEA and CK20 mRNAs were evaluated by the one-step nucleic acid amplification assay. An area under a receiver-operating-characteristic curve for CK19 mRNA (0.999) was slightly larger than that for CEA mRNA (0.946; P = 0.062) and significantly larger that than for CK20 mRNA (0.875; P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: We found that CK19 mRNA has the best diagnostic performance and its cut-off value for discriminating positive from negative lymph nodes can be set in the range of 75-500 copies/Âµl with 96.4% sensitivity and 100% specificity.
