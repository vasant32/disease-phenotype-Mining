The relative contribution of nutrition-related chronic diseases to the total                     disease burden of the society and the healthcare costs have risen continuously                     over the last decades. This challenge requires to explore and use the potential                     of dietary prevention of diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes,                     dyslipidaemia, cardiovascular disease and cancer. This evidence-based guideline                     systematically assessed the potential role of carbohydrates in the primary                     prevention of these diseases. The major findings were: a high consumption of                     sugar-sweetened beverages increases the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes                     (strength of evidence: probable), whereas a high dietary fibre intake, mainly                     from whole-grain products, reduces the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes,                     dyslipidaemia, hypertension, coronary heart disease and colorectal cancer                     (strength of evidence: probable and convincing, respectively). The practical                     consequences for current dietary recommendations are presented.
