Combination therapy with 2 or more drugs with different mechanisms of action has been considered a promising strategy for the effective treatment of advanced and metastatic cancers. However, the rational design of combination therapy represents a potential prerequisite for its effectiveness. Recently, we showed that the combination of oral metronomic S-1 dosing with oxaliplatin (l-OHP)-containing PEG-coated "neutral" liposomes exerted excellent antitumor activity. In addition, we recently designed a PEG-coated "cationic" liposome for dual-targeting delivery of l-OHP to tumor endothelial cells and tumor cells in a solid tumor. This targeted liposomal l-OHP formulation showed efficient antitumor activity in a murine tumor model, compared with l-OHP-containing PEG-coated "neutral" liposomes. In the present study, we investigated the issue of whether metronomic S-1 dosing with l-OHP-containing PEG-coated "cationic" liposomes creates synergy. Unfortunately, metronomic S-1 dosing resulted in impaired delivery of PEG-coated "cationic" liposomes into tumor tissue, presumably by decreasing the binding sites on tumor blood vessels available for the liposomes. The anticipated cytotoxic synergistic effect of the combination treatment was not achieved. Instead, the combination treatment showed lower antitumor efficacy than l-OHP-containing PEG-coated "cationic" liposomes alone. These results suggest that the combined treatment of S-1 and l-OHP-containing PEG-coated "cationic" liposomes seems to be antagonistic rather than synergistic.
