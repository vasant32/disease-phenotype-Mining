Here, we present the case of a 76-year-old woman who consulted us in April 2010, following a positive fecal occult blood test, and was diagnosed with lower rectal cancer. Signet-ring cell carcinoma was diagnosed by histology. Because hydronephrosis of both sides was considered the cause of dissemination of the tumor, only chemotherapy was performed. After the eighth course of XELOX+bevacizumab treatment, hydronephrosis of both sides improved and the tumor marker level became normal. An abdominoperineal rectal resection was performed in February 2011. The results of pathological examination of the resected specimen showed complete response. After the operation, the tumor marker level was elevated, and recurrence in the pelvic cavity and multiple bone metastases were detected by positron emission tomography/ computed tomography. Chemotherapy has now been resumed. Signet-ring cell carcinoma is rare in colorectal cancer. The frequency of multiple organ metastases is high, and the growth rate of the tumor is also high. Poor prognosis compared to the usual colorectal cancer has been reported.
