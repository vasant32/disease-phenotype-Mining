 OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the rate of salvage resections in patients with stage II and III colorectal cancer following intensive surveillance in a comprehensive cancer center. METHODS: Patients with stage II and III colorectal cancer with a minimum follow-up of 3 years were included. Carcinoembryonic antigen was obtained every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for years 3-5. CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were performed every 6 months for 2 years and then yearly for years 3-5. Colonoscopy was performed at year 1 and then every 3 years. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-seven patients were followed for a median of 60 months; 44 patients were diagnosed with recurrent disease. CT was the first sign of recurrence in 68% of patients. Carcinoembryonic antigen test was normal in 20 patients (45%) at the time of disease recurrence. Twenty-five patients (57%) with recurrent disease underwent curative-intent resection, 12 of whom are still cancer free at a median follow-up of 81 months. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective study, intensive radiographic screening was associated with a high salvage resection rate, which led to favorable clinical outcomes. Randomized clinical trials are urgently needed to define the optimal duration and schedule of radiographic screening in stage II and III colorectal cancer.
