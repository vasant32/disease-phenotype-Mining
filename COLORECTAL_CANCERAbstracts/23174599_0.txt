 OBJECTIVE: To study the expression of angiotensin-2 (Ang-2), Tie-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) in colorectal cancer and analyze their relationship with the occurrence, recurrence, metastasis, angiogenesis and prognosis of colorectal cancer. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry with SP method was used to detect the expressions of Ang-2, Tie-2 and VEGFR-2 in 118 colorectal cancer, 40 adjacent normal tissue and 40 benign colorectal lesion specimens. RESULTS: The positivity rates of Ang-2, Tie-2 and VEGFR-2 in colorectal cancer tissue were 74.58%, 69.49%, and 61.02%, respectively, significantly higher than those in the adjacent normal tissues (25.00%, 17.50%, and 17.50%, P<0.05) and benign colorectal lesion tissues (35.00%, 32.50%, and 32.50%, P<0.05). The rates of two or three coexpressions were significantly higher than that of a single expression in the cancer tissues (61.02% vs 15.25%). The microvascular density (MVD) of colorectal cancer tissues was 31.43∓10.50, significantly higher than that of the adjacent normal tissues (10.61∓3.76) and benign colorectal lesions (16.89∓3.83) (P<0.05). The expressions of Ang-2, Tie-2, and VEGFR-2 were positively correlated with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and MVD (P<0.05). The expression of Ang-2, but not Tie-2 and VEGFR-2, was positively correlated with CA199. Ang-2, Tie-2, and VEGFR-2 expressions showed significant differences between cases with tumor recurrence/metastasis and those withouts 5 years after radical mastectomy, and were all positively correlated with the 5-year survival rates (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Ang-2, Tie-2 and VEGFR-2 are involved in the development, invasion, metastasis, and prognosis of colorectal cancer, and play important roles in the angiogenesis of the tumors.
