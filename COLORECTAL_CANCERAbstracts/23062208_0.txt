 BACKGROUND: Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is one of the most frequently mutated suppressor genes in human cancers. However, there are no data about the role of PTEN IVS4 polymorphism in development of colorectal cancer (CRC). The authors aimed to determine the role of PTEN IVS4 variants in the etiology of CRC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A hospital-based case-control study was conducted in 203 patients with CRC (127 colon, 76 rectum) and 245 healthy controls. The frequencies of PTEN IVS4 (rs 3830675) genotypes were determined by using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. RESULTS: The (-/-) genotype of PTEN IVS4 that absence of ATCTT insertion at downstream of exon 4 in intron 4 of PTEN gene was found to be associated with 1.55-fold increased risk of colon cancer (p < 0.005; OR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.24 - 1.94) and 1.4-fold increased risk of rectum cancer (p < 0.005; OR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.08 - 1.82). Subgroup analyses showed that PTEN IVS4 genotypes were not associated with any clinicopathological characteristics of patients with CRC (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The (-/-) genotype of PTEN IVS4 gene might be associated with increased risk for development of CRC in a Turkish population. Further studies will clarify the exact role of PTEN IVS4 polymorphism in the etiology of CRC.
