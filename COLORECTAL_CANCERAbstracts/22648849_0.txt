 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility and efficacy of transanal specimen extraction in laparoscopic colorectal resection. METHODS: From January 2009 to December 2010, transanal specimen extraction technique was performed in 12 patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal resection. The clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There were 8 males and 4 females. The age ranged from 41 to 67 (mean, 58) years old. The mean operative time was (240±45) min, mean blood loss was (70±40) ml. There was no anastomotic leakage or stenosis. One patient with constipation suffered from intractable right lower abdominal pain and was managed with antispasmodic agents. The frequency of bowel movements was 3-7/d in the 5 patients with constipation and 1-2/d in patients with colorectal carcinoma at six months postoperatively. No local recurrence and metastasis in patients with colorectal cancer after follow-up of 1-20 months. CONCLUSION: Transanal specimen extraction in laparoscopic colorectal resection is feasible, safe, and reliable.
