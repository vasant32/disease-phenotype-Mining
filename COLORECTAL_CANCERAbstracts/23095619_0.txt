 BACKGROUND: The objective was to determine the liver regeneration capacity and morbidity and mortality rates after major hepatectomy for colorectal metastases in patients having undergone bevacizumab-based chemotherapy (bev+). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2006 and 2011, 41 patients underwent major hepatectomy within 3 months of bevacizumab and were matched with 41 patients operated on following systemic chemotherapy without bevacizumab (bev-). The matching criteria were the following: number of courses of chemotherapy, chemotherapy-free interval, age, and type of hepatectomy. After measurements of remnant liver volume (RLV) preoperatively and at 1 month (RLV1M), volumetric gain was calculated as absolute (RLV1M-RLV) or relative regeneration [(RLV1M-RLV/RLV)]. Ninety-day morbidity was rated according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. RESULTS: There were 21 right, 9 extended right, and 11 left hepatectomies in each group. Groups were comparable in terms of matching criteria, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, and RLV. No mortalities were observed. There were no intergroup differences in overall morbidity (56% in bev+ vs 34.1%; P = 0.075) or postoperative liver failure. A severe complication occurred in 5 bev+ (4 eviscerations) and 4 bev- (bile leakages) (P = 0.95). The median hospital stay was similar in both groups as were the degrees of absolute and relative liver regeneration (143% in bev+ vs 114%; P = 0.20). Liver regeneration was not influenced by the type of hepatectomy, the number of courses of chemotherapy, or age more than 65 years. CONCLUSIONS: In a methodologically robust trial in the largest cohort reported up to date, bevacizumab did not impair liver regeneration after major hepatectomy-even in elderly patients or those with high exposure to chemotherapy.
