 UNLABELLED: INTRODUCTION. The screening programmes are very challenging from the ethical perspective, and their impact in terms of morbidity and mortality make secondary colorectal cancer prevention a valuable public health intervention. METHODS: The target population people aged 50-69 years receive an invitation card with a test-tube for the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and an immunochemical test is used for fecal occult blood. Subjects positive to FOBT are invited to perform a gastroenterologic examination and a full colonoscopy. RESULTS: In the firt round of screening, 100% of the target population has been invited with an adhesion rate of 41.3%. A total of 1739 FOBT-positive subjects have been invited to the second level of the screening. 1429 of them have performed the gastroenterologic examination (83.9%). To date 956 full colonoscopies have been completed and the rate of subjects affected by carcinoma, malignant polyp and advanced adenoma has been equal to 23.5%. DISCUSSION: Thanks to the reminders already sent, an increasing compliance has been registered with an increased rate of subjects with a low schooling that have performed a FOBT test. With the aim to optimize all the operative aspects of the screening programme it is already ongoing a set of meetings between health workers of Local Health Unit 4 and General Practioners.
