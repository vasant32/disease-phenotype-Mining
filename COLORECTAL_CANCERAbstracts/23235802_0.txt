BackgroundMicrosatellite instability (MSI) was suggested as a marker for good prognosis in colorectal cancer in 1993 and a systematic review from 2005 and a meta-analysis from 2010 support the initial observation. We here assess the prognostic impact and prevalence of MSI in different stages in a consecutive, population-based series from a single hospital in Oslo, Norway.Patients and methodsOf 1274 patients, 952 underwent major resection of which 805 were included in analyses of MSI prevalence and 613 with complete resection in analyses of outcome. Formalin-fixed tumor tissue was used for PCR-based MSI analyses.ResultsThe overall prevalence of MSI was 14%, highest in females (19%) and in proximal colon cancer (29%). Five-year relapse-free survival (5-year RFS) was 67% and 55% (P = 0.030) in patients with MSI and MSS tumors, respectively, with the hazard ratio (HR) equal to 1.60 (P = 0.045) in multivariate analysis. The improved outcome was confined to stage II patients who had 5-year RFS of 74% and 56% respectively (P = 0.010), HR = 2.02 (P = 0.040).Examination of 12 or more lymph nodes was significantly associated with proximal tumor location (P < 0.001).ConclusionsMSI has an independent positive prognostic impact on stage II colorectal cancer patients after complete resection.
