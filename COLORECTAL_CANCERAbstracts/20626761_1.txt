 AIM: In central Liverpool, the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is 119% of the national average. Currently, screening is offered to those aged 60-70 through the National Bowel Cancer screening programme. A theoretical model showing the effect of the introduction of biennial screening in individuals aged 50-59 has been applied to the population of central Liverpool. METHOD: The impact of screening using faecal occult blood testing (FOBT) in individuals aged 50-59 in central Liverpool (n = 47,440; males 23,312) was assessed by a model based on three levels of compliance. RESULTS: After modelling, the positive FOBT result for increased incidence of CRC, the positive predictive value for adenoma and cancer detection was calculated using age-specific positivity rates. The results indicate that between 120 and 162 new diagnoses of CRC per 100,000 population aged 50-59 could be detected by biennial screening, dependent on compliance rates. CONCLUSION: Screening individuals aged 50-59 can identify early cancers and significant adenomas, which may contribute to a reduction in the expected high mortality rate found in this geographical area.
