Colorectal cancer (CRC) can only be cured by complete resection of the tumour. Primarily unresectable metastases of the liver are treated by chemotherapy to achieve down-sizing of metastasis and curative resection. Chemotherapy can affect tumour-free healthy liver tissue and lead to histopathological and functional changes summarised as "chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis" (CASH). We have evaluated a histopathological scoring system for CASH and searched for preoperative risk factors for the development of CASH. Liver alterations such as CASH were more pronounced when patients received chemotherapy, especially when treated with oxaliplatin. A higher BMI, male sex and elevated serum transaminases were risk factors for the development of CASH. Patients with a higher CASH score, reflecting more advanced changes in liver tissue, had a higher serum peak bilirubin level postoperatively. We did not find a higher morbidity or mortality in patients with a more severe liver damage measured by the CASH score.
