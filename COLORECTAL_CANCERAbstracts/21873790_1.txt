 OBJECTIVE: To study the change of inflammatory factors at different stages of colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: Thirty normal subjects, 30 patients with colorectal adenomatous polyps and 120 CRC patients at different stages were enrolled. IgG, IgM, and IgA levels, the inflammatory cytokines IL-2, 4, 6, 10, and 12 and the expression of TGF-β 1 and VEGF in the serum were analyzed by ELISA or immunoturbidimetry. RESULTS: The serum concentrations of IL-12, TGF-β 1, and IL-6 in the CRC patients were statistically different compared with the normal and adenomatous polyps, and increased as the disease progressed (P<0.05). IL-6 reached the highest level in C phase of CRC.The serum concentrations of IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10 were significantly different among the groups. VEGF serum levels in CRC Phase A and Phase B compared with other groups were statistically different, but other serum concentrations had no significant difference (P>0.05). The serum level of IgG, IgM, and IgA in the 3 groups showed no significant difference (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The serum level of inflammatory cytokines TGF-β 1, IL-6, and IL-12 increases gradually with the development of CRC, which may change the microcirculation of patients with CRC, and promote the development of CRC.
