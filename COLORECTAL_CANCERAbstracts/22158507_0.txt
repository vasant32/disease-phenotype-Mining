 INTRODUCTION: Oxaliplatin is a third-generation platinum compound with proven antitumor activity in the treatment of colorectal cancer. The occurrence of life-threating hemolitic uremic syndrome has been observed after oxaliplatin therapy. The kind of tumor and treatment modalities seem to influence the onset of hemolitic uremic syndrome. METHODS: The clinical course of the case is reviewed and compared with reports of other similar cases in the literature. RESULTS: We describe the development of hemolitic uremic syndrome as a result of prolonged oxaliplatin treatment of a colon cancer patient. CONCLUSIONS: Although this rare event requires the concurrence of other unknown factors, it should be considered in a decision-making setting.
