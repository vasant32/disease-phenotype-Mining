Hepatoid adenocarcinoma is a rare extra hepatic neoplasm that displays morphological and phenotypic features similar to those of hepatocellular carcinoma. We report a case of a 75-year-old woman, presenting with abdominal pain and complaints of weakness and lost of appetite, who was found to have a mass on her right colon. She underwent right hemicolectomy for a pT3N2M0, stage IIIC colon cancer. The tumor phenotype and immunophenotype, as documented by alpha-fetoprotein immunoreaction positivity, were consistent with adenocarcinoma of hepatoid origin. The patient received FOLFOX-4 regimen as adjuvant treatment, relapsed after six cycles, then was switched to FOLFIRI regimen plus Bevacizumab and progressed after only four cycles. She died 1Â month later, eight months after the diagnosis. The lack of any clinical benefit despite an aggressive and multimodal therapeutic strategy, raises a question about what should be targeted when we face this rare disease associated with a very poor prognosis.
