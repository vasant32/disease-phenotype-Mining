 AIM: To construct a lentivirus-based inhibitor with specific secondary structure that could exert long-term suppression on microRNA-338-3p (miR-338-3p), thus elucidating its molecular function in colorectal carcinoma cells. METHODS: The miR-338-3p inhibitor sequence was synthesized and inserted into pLV-THM plasmid. HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with the lentiviral vectors pLV-THM-miR-338-3p-inhibitor, psPAX2, and pMD2.G. The supernatant containing the lentivirus particles was harvested to determine the viral titer, and then used to infect colorectal carcinoma-derived SW-620 cells. eGFP(+) cells were sorted using flow cytometry. The expression of miR-338-3p in SW-620 cells was determined with real-time RT-PCR, and the expression of the smoothened (SMO) protein was detected using Western blot analysis. The migration ability of the transfected SW-620 cells was assessed with transwell assay. RESULTS: Restriction endonuclease analysis and DNA sequencing demonstrated that the lentiviral vector pLV-THM-miR-338-3p-inhibitor was successfully constructed. The expression of miR-338-3p in SW-620 cells was significantly decreased by infection with the lentivirus pLV-THM-miR-338-3p-inhibitor. Moreover, the down-regulated expression of miR-338-3p caused up-regulated expression of the SMO protein in SW-620 cells, which showed significantly enhanced migration in transwell assay. CONCLUSION: The construction of the lentiviral vector pLV-THM-miR-338-3p-inhibitor with specific secondary structure provides a basis for further studies the molecular function of miR-338-3p in colorectal carcinoma. miR-338-3p may suppress SMO gene expression and thereby inhibit colorectal carcinoma migration.
