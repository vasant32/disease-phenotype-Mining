PURPOSE: We previously established a novel method of primary culture for human colorectal cancer. This method, termed the CTOS method, involves the preparation of multicellular spheroids of primary cancer cells that are cultured so that cell-cell contact is maintained. Here we applied the CTOS method to human urothelial cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CTOSs were prepared from xenografts or primary human bladder urothelial cancer tumors following the same protocol used for human colorectal cancer. The CTOSs were characterized using immunohistochemistry, Western blot and PCR. RESULTS: We established a xenograft from a primary bladder urothelial cancer and isolated and cultured CTOSs from the xenograft tumor. The CTOSs retained the characteristics of the original tumor as well as those of the xenograft. HRG promoted the growth of the CTOSs. Both inhibitors of PI3K and mTOR inhibited HRG-induced CTOS growth. Lapatinib, but not erlotinib, inhibited HRG-induced CTOS growth. We also prepared CTOSs from primary tumors of bladder urothelial cancer. The success rate of establishing primary CTOSs from non-muscle-invasive urothelial cancer was 90.7% and that from muscle-invasive cancer was 68.2%. The overall success rate was 84.2%. HRG promoted the growth of primary CTOSs from 4 of 7 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Here we report a method for establishing primary cultures of human urothelial cancer cells. Stimulation of the growth by HRG in CTOSs from xenografts and primary tumors suggests the possibility of molecular targeting therapy against HER3 signaling for human urothelial cancer. The CTOS method might be useful for selecting patients for molecular targeting drugs like lapatinib.
