We designed a case-control study to determine the plasma homocysteine (Hcy) level and evaluate the potential role of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T gene polymorphism in colorectal cancer (CRC). Total Hcy was quantified using the fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) on the IMx analyzer. Genomic DNA was analyzed by the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The plasma levels of Hcy in the CRC group (12.63±3.11 μmol/l) were significantly higher compared with those in the control group (10.87±2.42 μmol/l; P<0.05). The frequency of the MTHFR 677TT genotype in CRC patients was markedly high. The MTHFR 677TT genotype was significantly correlated with an increased risk of CRC (odds ratio, 1.671; 95% confidence interval, 1.094-2.553; P=0.018). This study suggests that the MTHFR C677T polymorphism indicates susceptibility to CRC and is correlated with CRC pathogenesis, suggesting that the homozygous variant MTHFR C677T polymorphism is a candidate risk factor for CRC.
