 BACKGROUND: 14-3-3ε regulates diverse biological processes and plays a significant role in the formation of malignant tumors. However, the localization and clinical significance of 14-3-3ε in colorectal cancer (CRC) have not been elucidated. METHODS: We investigated 14-3-3ε expression and its prognostic significance in CRC. CRC surgical samples were taken from 137 clinicopathologically characterized CRC cases. 14-3-3ε expression was tested by immunohistochemical assay. Separate Western blot of nuclear and cytosol preparations confirmed nuclear localization of 14-3-3ε protein. RESULTS: Nuclear expression of 14-3-3ε was observed in 76.9% of normal colorectal tissue and 78.8% of all CRC samples. Statistical analysis showed that there was significant difference of nuclear 14-3-3ε expression in patients categorized according to lymph node metastasis. A trend was identified between decreasing nuclear 14-3-3ε expression in CRC and worsening clinical prognosis. Multivariate analysis showed that loss of nuclear 14-3-3ε expression was an independent prognostic indicator for patient's survival. CONCLUSIONS: The current data provide evidence that 14-3-3ε is not exclusively a cytosolic protein, but is also detectable within the nucleus. Our results suggest that nuclear 14-3-3ε as a suppressor may serve as important biomarker of tumor metastasis. Loss of nuclear 14-3-3ε is closely associated with poor overall survival in CRC patients.
