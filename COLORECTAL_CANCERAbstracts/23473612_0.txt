BACKGROUND: The detection of KRAS mutations is mandatory to initiate an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody in the treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This observational retrospective study was performed in 160 French centres during a 2-week period in 2011. Its main objective was to evaluate the rate of KRAS testing in patients with mCRC having initiated their first-line therapy. Secondary objectives included time of process, techniques used and reasons for non-prescription. RESULTS: Five hundred and thirty eight mCRC patients (67.1±11.3years, synchronous metastases: 69.9%) were enrolled in the study. KRAS testing was prescribed in 81.1% of patients, in a median of 15days after the diagnosis of metastases, and of 15days prior to the initiation of the first-line metastatic chemotherapy. KRAS status was available for 87% of patients, after 23.6±28.2days, but after the choice of the first-line therapy in 56.6% of patients. Heterogeneity of reception time was noteworthy within regions (8.3±7days to 38.8±101days). KRAS testing was not prescribed mainly due to the planned non-prescription of an anti-EGFR antibody. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that KRAS testing is definitely part of the management of most of mCRC patients, despite discrepancies observed in the rate of prescription and the time of results.
