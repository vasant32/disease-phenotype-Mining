After lung cancer, bowel cancer is the second most deadly cancer in France. Since 2009, it has been subject to an organised screening programme aimed at reducing mortality rates. The nursing care brings together a multi-disciplinary team which, from the diagnosis announcement and throughout the treatment, seeks to place the patient at the centre of the therapeutic project.
