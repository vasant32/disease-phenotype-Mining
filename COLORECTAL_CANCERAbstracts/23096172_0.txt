 OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to assess the effect of observers on combined metabolic-vascular parameters in colorectal cancer. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five prospective patients (12 men and 13 women; mean age, 66.9 years) with proven primary colorectal adenocarcinoma underwent integrated (18)F-FDG PET/perfusion CT to assess tumor metabolism (mean and maximum standardized uptake value [SUV(mean) and SUV(max), respectively]) and vascularization (blood flow [BF], blood volume [BV], permeability surface-area product, and standardized perfusion value). Intra- and interobserver agreement for PET, perfusion CT, and combined metabolic-flow parameters were determined by Bland-Altman statistics and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). RESULTS: The mean tumor size was 3.8 Â± 1.6 cm; there were five stage IA/B, six stage IIA/B, eight stage IIIA/B, and six stage IV tumors. Intra- and interobserver agreement for individual parameters was fair to good, with mean differences between observers of -0.74 for SUV(max), -0.16 for SUV(mean), 9.72 for BF, 0.15 for BV, -0.76 for permeability surface-area product, and 0.09 for standardized perfusion value. ICCs were 0.44-0.99 and 0.38-0.89 for intra- and interobserver agreement, respectively. Interobserver agreement was variable for combined metabolic-flow parameters but better for metabolic-flow difference than for metabolic-flow ratio: ICCs were 0.69-0.88 for the metabolic-flow difference and 0.44-0.94 for the metabolic-flow ratio. CONCLUSION: Combined parameters to assess the metabolic-flow relationship are influenced by observer variation. Intra- and interobserver agreement are better for the metabolic-flow differences than for the ratios, suggesting that metabolic-flow differences may be a more robust parameter for clinical practice.
