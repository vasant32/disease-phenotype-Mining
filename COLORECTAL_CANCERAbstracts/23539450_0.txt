A subset of aggressive colorectal cancers exhibit BRAF mutation, MLH1 methylation and a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), but precursors are poorly established. In this study, we determined the status of these markers in colorectal polyps and evaluated associated risk factors. The study included 932 polyp cases and 1,027 controls who were ages 24-80, part of a group health program, received a colonoscopy from 1998-2007 and completed a structured questionnaire assessing risk factors. Following standard pathology review, polyps were assayed for BRAF mutation (V600E) and tested for MLH1 and CIMP methylation, the latter including the genes CACNA1G, IGF2, NEUROG1, RUNX3, and SOCS1. Polytomous logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between molecularly-defined subsets of polyps and potential risk factors. 580 conventional adenomas and 419 serrated lesions were successfully assayed. For adenomas, the prevalence of each marker was ≤1%. In contrast, 55% of serrated lesions harbored mutant BRAF, 26% were CIMP-high and 5% had methylated MLH1. In these lesions, the highest prevalence of markers was in sessile serrated polyps (SSPs) of ≥10 mm that localized to right-sided/cecal regions of the colon. Risk factors for CIMP-high serrated lesions included Caucasian race, current smoking status and a history of polyps, whereas for serrated lesions with mutant BRAF the significant risk factors were male sex, current smoking status, obesity and a history of polyps. Our results suggest that SSPs and other large, right-sided serrated lesions have a unique molecular profile that is similar to CIMP-high, BRAF-mutated colorectal cancers.
