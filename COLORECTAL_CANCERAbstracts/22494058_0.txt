Arm protein lost in epithelial cancers, on chromosome X (ALEX; also known as armadillo repeat containing, X-linked [ARMCX]) is a novel subgroup within the armadillo (ARM) family, which has several ARM repeat domains. The biological function of classical ARM family members such as Î²-catenin is well understood, but that of the ALEX/ARMCX family members is largely unknown. Here we evaluate the effects of ALEX1 overexpression on in vitro colony formation ability and expression of ALEX1 mRNA in human colorectal tumor. Overexpression of ALEX1 suppressed the anchorage-dependent and -independent colony formation of human colorectal carcinoma cell lines by the study of stable clones of HCT116 cells expressing ALEX1 protein. Bisulfite genomic sequencing revealed that the promoter region of ALEX1 gene was highly methylated in both HCT116 and SW480 cells in comparison with PANC-1 and MCF-7 cells, which express endogenous ALEX1 mRNA, indicating the capability of promoter methylation to silence ALEX1 gene in HCT116 and SW480 cells. Our current findings suggest that overexpression of ALEX1 play a negative role in human colorectal tumorigenesis.
