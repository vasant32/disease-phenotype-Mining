Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening has been shown to decrease the incidence of CRC cancers and decrease mortality. Studies show that the most important predictor of patient compliance with CRC screening is physician recommendation. We assessed the knowledge and attitudes of medical students regarding cancer screening. A study-specific questionnaire was distributed to medical students (MS) at two medical schools. There was a significant difference in the percentage of correctly answered questions regarding screening recommendations between first year MS and all other years for both schools. However, MS attitudes towards CRC screening were consistent between classes and schools. Although most MS had positive attitudes regarding cancer screening our survey identified several important deficits in knowledge.
