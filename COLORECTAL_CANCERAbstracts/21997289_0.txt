 OBJECTIVE: Published data on the relationship between E-cadherin (CDH1) gene promoter polymorphisms and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk are inconclusive. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis was carried out. METHODS: In this meta-analysis, we evaluated reported studies of associations between polymorphisms of CDH1 gene promoter -160 C > A and -347 G > GA site, and CRC risk using fixed-effects model and random-effects model. RESULTS: We found decreased CRC risk among subjects carrying CDH1 -160AA (odds ratio [OR] = 0.86, 95 percent confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.75-0.98) and CA + AA (OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.87-0.98), using 4,652/4,428 cases/controls and 7,866/7,689 cases/controls from ten studies, respectively. We found a protective effect of the CDH1 -160CA + AA polymorphisms for CRC in distal site tumor population and population-based control in stratified analysis. We found a protective effect of the CDH1 -160AA and CA + AA polymorphisms for CRC in European and American population (OR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.76-0.99 and OR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.85-0.98, respectively). We observed that the CDH1 -347 G/GA + GA/GA carrier had an increased risk of CRC, the summary OR was 1.33 (95% CI: 1.08-1.62). CONCLUSIONS: Data indicated that certain CDH1 gene promoter -160 C > A and -347 G > GA variants might affect the susceptibility of CRC. Recommendations for further studies include pooling of individual data to facilitate evaluation of multigenic effects and detailed analysis of effect modification by environmental and lifestyle factors.
