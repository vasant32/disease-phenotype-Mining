 BACKGROUND: The aim of this retrospective study was to compare the results achieved by simultaneous resection (SR) vs. delayed resection (DR) in patients with synchronous colorectal liver metastases (SCRLM). METHODS: In "Dan Setlacec" Center of General Surgery and Liver Transplantation from Fundeni Clinical Institute, between 1995 and 2010, 117 patients underwent SR and 25 patients underwent DR. It was compared the outcome of the patients in the two groups. It was also assessed if certain subgroups of patients present a better outcome after DR than after SR. RESULTS: The location of the primary tumor, the number and diameter of liver metastases, and the proportion of major hepatectomies were similar in the two groups (p value > 0.05). For all patients, the morbidity, mortality, disease-free and overall surrvival rates were not statistically significant different between the two groups (p value > 0.05). In subgroups of patients with rectal tumors, with multiple liver metastases, and undergoing major hepatectomies, the morbidity, mortality and survival rates achieved by SR were similar to those achieved by DR. CONCLUSION: Simultaneous resection of SCRLM is similarly safe and efficient as the delayed resection, even in patients with rectal tumors, with multiple liver metastases, or undergoing major hepatectomies.
