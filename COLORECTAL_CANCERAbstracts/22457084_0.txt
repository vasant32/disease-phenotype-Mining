 BACKGROUND: Current international guidelines on colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment suggest performing adjuvant chemotherapy only in Stage II patients presenting with high-risk prognostic factors. Aim of the study was to a the impact of these parameters on the survival of Stage IIa CRC patients, focusing on the prognostic value of the number of harvested lymph nodes (NHLN). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Out of 651 CRC patients undergoing surgical resection, 204 T3-N0-M0 were selected and reviewed. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were adapted for the evaluation of the prognostic factors. RESULTS: The 5 years actuarial DFS, DSS, and OS rates of patients with a NHLN >12 were significantly better compared to those of patients with a NHLN <12 (respectively: 72.8% vs. 50.4% P=0.001; 82% vs. 56% P=0.001; 78.5% vs. 53.1% P=0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that a NHLN >12 was the only independent parameter of statistical significance influencing DFS, DSS, and OS. CONCLUSIONS: According to our findings, the NHLN is the main predictor of survival in Stage IIa CRC patients. This would appear to suggest the need of a better stratification of Stage IIa CRC patients, sub-dividing patients with more or less than 12 NHLN.
