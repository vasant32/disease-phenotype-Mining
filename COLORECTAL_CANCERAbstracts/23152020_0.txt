Oxaliplatin (L-OHP)is an important chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of colorectal cancer. Peripheral neuropathy was observed in 90% of patients who received L-OHP.Neuropathy often results in the discontinuation of treatment or a decrease the quality of life(QOL). The most effective method for reducing neuropathy is the discontinuation of L-OHP. To reduce neuropathy, we administered Keishikajutsubutou(TJ-18)with powdered processed aconite root(TJ-3023), and we report the effect of these compounds. The subjects comprised 11 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. L-OHP(85mg/m2)was administered as part of the FOLFOX6(10 patients)or FOLFOX7(1 patient)regimen. All patients had experienced neuropathy. We administered TJ-18(7.5 g)and T-3023(1 g). After 2 weeks, the TJ-3023 dose was increased to 2 g for nonresponders. The response was evaluated according to the Neurotoxicity Criteria of DEBIOPHARM. Reduction in neuropathy was observed in 5 cases(45.5% ). Among 6 patients whose feet and hands felt warm, reduction in neuropathy was observed in 5(83.3% ).
