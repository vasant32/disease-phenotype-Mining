Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major health problem worldwide. Angiogenesis is a key process for tumor growth and metastasis. The conversion of tumor cells to an angiogenic phenotype involves the change in the balance of angiogenic growth factors and angiogenesis inhibitors. In our study we evaluated by qRT-PCR the level of expression of 3 growth factors involved in angiogenesis: platelet derived growth factor-B (PDGFb), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in patients with different stages of colon cancer. Our results showed the level of VEGF increased on all tumor without difference, statistically significant according with tumor stage whereas the others the levels of bFGF and PDGF were higher, statistically significant, on tumor classified stage B compared with stage C. The early implication of these molecules in colon carcinogenesis justifies the development of new biologic individualized therapies.
