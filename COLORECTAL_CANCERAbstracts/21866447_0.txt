 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of surgical treatment for recurrent colorectal carcinoma in the elderly. METHODS: The clinical and follow up data of 24 elderly patients with recurrent colorectal carcinoma who were treated between January 2000 and June 2009 at the Changhai hospital of the Second Military Medical University were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Among the 24 patients there were 14 men and 10 women. The mean age of the patients was 76.9 Â± 5.3 years. The local recurrence was found in 15 patients. In 9 patients, both distant metastases and local recurrence were found. A total of 24 patients received operation, including radical resection in 15 patients and palliative resection in 8 patients. One patient had laparotomy only because of diffuse metastases in the abdomen and involvement of the duodenum and common bile duct.The patient received stent placement in the common bile duct and chemotherapy after the surgery. Postoperative complication occurred in 7(29.2%) patients, which included ileus(n=1), pulmonary infection(n=1), urinary infection(n=1), wound infection(n=2), wound dehiscence(n=1), and wound fat liquefaction(n=1). There were no perioperative deaths. The median survival time was 6 months in the entire cohort. The median survival time was 33 months in patients undergoing radical resection, and the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rate was 71.4%, 28.6%, and 14.3%. The median survival time was 3 months in patients who underwent palliative resection, and the 1-year survival rate was 0. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant(P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Outcomes are acceptable after radical resection for elderly patients with recurrent colorectal cancer if careful preoperative evaluation and perioperative management are performed.
