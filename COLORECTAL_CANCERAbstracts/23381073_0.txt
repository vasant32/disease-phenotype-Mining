Although colonoscopy is estimated to reduce colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality by about 50%, there is room for improvement. Quality improvement efforts to date have largely focused on adenoma detection rate (ADR). A few studies have now been successful in improving this measure. However, the question remains whether continued quality improvement should focus so heavily on this metric. Given the likely importance of the serrated pathway to the problem of post colonoscopy (or interval) cancer, future quality work should consider both the detection and resection of these lesions.
