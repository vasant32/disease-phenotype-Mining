The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors related to screening intention in a population-based screening programme for colorectal cancer. The data were taken from the 2008 Korean National Cancer Screening Survey. We conducted a nationwide survey with trained interviewers using a questionnaire. A total of 2038 participants agreed to answer the survey. There were 955 study subjects aged â‰¥ 50 years in the target age group for colorectal cancer screening. Colorectal cancer screening behaviour and demographic characteristics were collected to evaluate intention for colorectal cancer screening and related factors. Descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression were used in the analysis. The lifetime screening rate was 50.4% (50.9% for men and 49.8% for women). The screening rate with recommendation was 39.7% (39.3% for men and 40.1% of women). The odds ratios of intention to be screened increased significantly in younger subjects and those screened with double-contrast barium enema or colonoscopy. 'Without any symptoms' was reported as the most frequent reason for non-attendance or no intention to be screened. Age and recent screening methods were important factors related to intention to be screened for colorectal cancer. Further research is needed to identify remaining barriers to screening.
