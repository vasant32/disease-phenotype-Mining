 BACKGROUND: An oxaliplatin-based regimen as the adjuvant treatment for stage III colon cancer demonstrated a survival advantage over fluorouracil (FU) and leucovorin (LV) in the MOSAIC and NSABP C-07 trials. For adjuvant treatment after the resection of metastases from colorectal cancer), active chemotherapy regimens such as FOLFOX are recommended. However, the safety data of FOLFOX are insufficient for its use after metastasectomy of colorectal cancer in Japanese patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of mFOLFOX6 for adjuvant treatment after the resection of metastases from colorectal cancer. METHODS: Among 67 consecutive patients who received mFOLFOX6 as the adjuvant treatment after resection of metastases from colorectal cancer between September 2002 and March 2009 in our institution, 51 patients who had not received preoperative chemotherapy were reviewed. The mFOLFOX6 treatment comprised oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2) and l-leucovorin 200 mg/m(2) given intravenously over a 2-h period on day 1, followed by a 5-FU bolus of 400 mg/m(2) and a 46-h infusion of 5-FU 2400 mg/m(2), every 2 weeks for up to 12 cycles. RESULTS: National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (NCI-CTC) grade 3-4 toxicities per patient were: peripheral neuropathy 8%, allergic reaction 4%, aspartate transaminase (AST) 4%, febrile neutropenia 4%, nausea 2%, anorexia 2%, fatigue 2%, alanine transaminase (ALT) 2%, bilirubin 2%, neutrophils 49%, leukocytes 6%, and hemoglobin 2%; 71% of the patients completed the scheduled 12 cycles. CONCLUSION: Adjuvant therapy with mFOLFOX6 after resection of metastases from colorectal cancer is feasible for Japanese patients.
