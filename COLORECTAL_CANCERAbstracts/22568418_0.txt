 OBJECTIVES: Advances in surgical techniques and chemotherapeutic options have expanded indications for surgery in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. This study aimed to examine how hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) surgeons approach the management of patients with hepatic colorectal cancer metastases (HCCM). METHODS: A web-based survey utilizing 10 clinical scenarios was distributed by e-mail to 37 HPB surgeons in Ontario, Canada. The study region has a population of approximately 13 million people and a universal, single-payer health care system. Descriptive analyses were used to tabulate results. RESULTS: Twenty-two (59%) surgeons responded to the survey. The majority (19/22, 86%) of respondents favoured neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with multiple synchronous and unilobar metastases; only nine of 22 (41%) respondents favoured neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with a single synchronous metastasis. In the setting of residual resectable disease following downstaging chemotherapy, 77% (17/22) of surgeons advocated hepatic resection with either radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or wedge resection of the 'ghost' lesions. Over 80% of surgeons would perform a liver and pulmonary resection in a patient with hepatic and multiple unilobar lung metastases. None would offer liver resection to patients with multiple retroperitoneal node involvement, although 55% (12/22) would do so if a single retroperitoneal node was involved. Preoperative portal vein embolization was favoured over RFA in patients with a small metastasis and inadequate functional hepatic volume. CONCLUSIONS: Notable heterogeneity was observed among Ontario's HPB surgeons in approaches to HCCM.
