This work was undertaken to gain further information on the molecular mechanisms             underlying autophagosome formation and its relation with tumor cell survival in             response to radiation in colon cancer. A human colon cancer cell line, HCT-116,             was examined with respect to cell survival after blockade of irradiation-induced             autophagosome formation by pharmacological interference. Autophagosome formation             was confirmed using a kinetic study with incorporated bovine serum albumin gold-conjugate             (BSA-Au) analyzed by electron microscopy and an autophagosome-associated LC3B             antibody measured by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Annexin V/PI double             staining was used to monitor cell death by apoptosis, and cell cycle profiles             by flow cytometry. Ionizing radiation (IR) promoted autophagosome formation in             the HCT-116 IR-surviving cells. Pharmacological interference showed that PI3K/Akt             and Src were involved in early stages of autophagosome formation. IR alone decreased             cell proliferation by arresting cells in the G2/M phase, and pharmacological interference             of autophagosome formation decreased proliferation, but did not affect cell survival.             Also, our data suggest that decreased proliferation caused by PI3K and Src inhibitors             could be through S phase cell cycle delay. Our results clearly indicate that blockade             of IR-induced autophagosome formation impairs proliferation but does not enhance             cell death in colon cancer cells.
