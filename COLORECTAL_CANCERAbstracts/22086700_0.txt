Chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer is constantly advancing. Its use in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting is also increasing. However, while long-term survival is improving, clinicians must be aware of the possible adverse events that can occur when treating with adjuvant chemotherapy and liver resection. We present a case of a life-threatening delayed bile leak following a liver resection for metastatic colorectal cancer in association with adjuvant treatment with bevacizumab. A 53-year-old man was treated with neoadjuvant bevacizumab followed by liver resection for metastatic colorectal cancer. He made an uneventful recovery. Forty-three days post-surgery he received bevacizumab and developed acute life-threatening bile leaks from the cut surface of the liver. He spent a total of 65 days in hospital, and required ERCP repeatedly and eventually had a repeat liver resection to resolve the bile leak. This case reports a possible association between bevacizumab and a life threatening delayed bile leak following liver resection.
