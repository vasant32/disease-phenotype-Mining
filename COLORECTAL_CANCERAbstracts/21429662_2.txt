Paclitaxel, one of key drugs to treat a wide range of malignancies, exhibits relative low sensitivity for colorectal cancer. The present study was to examine whether and how phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K) signals affect the sensitivity of colorectal cancer to paclitaxel. Four colorectal cancer cell lines were exposed to paclitaxel in the presence of PI3K signal inhibitors, such as LY294002, siRNA for Akt, or rapamycin, with or without MAPK inhibitor, PD98059. Cell viability and apoptosis were determined by MTT assay, cell cycle analysis in flow cytometer and Hoechst nuclear staining. To analyze the PI3K activity, the expression in phosphorylated Akt and downstream effectors of p70S6 kinase (S6K) were evaluated by Western blot analysis. Paclitaxel alone (5-10 nM) did not induce the apoptosis in all four cell lines. Although LY294002 alone did not affect the cell viability, it suppressed the Akt and S6K activities and induced the sub-G1 arrest/apoptosis when paclitaxel was co-administered, as well as the Akt siRNA and rapamycin did. Simultaneous blockade of PI3K and MAPK pathways more suppressed the S6K activity and further increased the apoptosis. In conclusion, PI3K is involved in low susceptibility of colorectal cancer to paclitaxel and dual PI3K/MAPK targeting agents may evolve a new paclitaxel-based chemotherapy for colorectal cancer.
