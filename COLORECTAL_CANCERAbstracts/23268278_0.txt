 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the independent predictors of postoperative mortality, morbidity, and long-term survival in patients with stage IIII( colorectal cancer. METHODS: Clinical data of 189 patients with stage IIII( colorectal cancer undergoing palliative resection of primary tumor in the presence of unresectable synchronous metastases were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Eighty-six (45.5%)patients developed postoperative complications. Preoperative predictors of medical complications included age(â‰¥65, P=0.039) and emergency operations (P=0.001). Preoperative predictors of surgical complications included advanced local disease (T4, P=0.022) and lymph node spread (N2, P=0.009). Seventeen (9.0%) patients died in the postoperative period. Mortality was independently associated with age(P=0.013), peritoneal dissemination(P=0.010), emergency operations(P=0.001) and medical complications(P=0.008). The survival rates at 1-, 2-, and 3- year of 172 patients admitted in survival analysis were 41.2%, 22.7% and 7.7% respectively. Independent factors associated with poor overall survival included lymph node spread(N2, P=0.015) and poor tumor differentiation(P=0.038). CONCLUSIONS: Emergency operations should be avoid when palliative resection of primary tumor is considered for stage IIII( colorectal cancer patients, especially for elderly patients and those with peritoneal dissemination. The significance of palliative resection is limited for stage IIII( colorectal cancer patients with lymph node spread and poor tumor differentiation.
