OBJECTIVES:There is suggestive but sparse evidence that dyslipidemia is associated with colorectal neoplasms. We investigated the association of serum lipid and apolipoprotein concentrations with the prevalence of colorectal adenomas.METHODS:Cross-sectional study of 19,281 consecutive participants aged 40-79 years undergoing screening colonoscopy at the Center for Health Promotion of the Samsung Medical Center in Korea from January 2006 to June 2009.RESULTS:We identified 5,958 participants with colorectal adenomas (30.9%), including 5,504 (28.5%) with non-advanced adenomas and 454 (2.4%) with advanced adenomas. The adjusted relative prevalence ratios (aRPRs) comparing the fourth with the first quartiles of serum triglycerides were 1.35 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20-1.52; P trend<0.001) for non-advanced adenomas and 1.45 (95% CI 1.02-2.06; P trend=0.005) for advanced adenomas. Higher levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-1 (ApoA-1) were significantly associated with 12% (Q4 vs. Q1 aRPR 1.12; 95% CI 1.00-1.26; P trend=0.049) and 17% (Q4 vs. Q1 aRPR 1.17; 95% CI 1.04-1.31; P trend=0.004) higher prevalence of non-advanced adenoma. There was also a non-significant association between higher levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (Q4 vs. Q1 aRPR 1.22; 95% CI 0.91-1.66; P trend= 0.12) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) (Q4 vs. Q1 aRPR 1.32; 95% CI 0.94-1.83; P trend=0.07) with higher prevalence of advanced adenoma. There was no association between total cholesterol levels with colorectal adenoma.CONCLUSIONS:In this large cross-sectional study, higher levels of serum triglycerides were significantly associated with an increasing prevalence of both non-advanced and advanced colorectal adenomas, while higher levels of ApoA-1 and HDL cholesterol were significantly associated with an increasing prevalence of non-advanced adenomas.Am J Gastroenterol advance online publication, 2 April 2013; doi:10.1038/ajg.2013.64.
