Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Half of Americans older than age 50 are not current with recommended screening; research is needed to assess the impact of interventions designed to increase receipt of CRC screening. The Colorectal Cancer Screening in Primary Care (C-TRIP) study is a theoretically informed group randomized trial within 32 primary care practices. Baseline median proportion of active patients aged 50 years or older up-to-date with CRC screening among the 32 practices was 50.8% (N = 55,746). Men were more likely to have been screened than women (52.9% vs. 49.2%, respectively). Patients 50 to 59 years of age were less likely to be up-to-date with screening (45.4%) than those in the 60 to 69 years and 70 to 79 years groups (58.5% in both groups). Opportunities exist to increase the proportion of CRC screening received in adults aged 50 and older. C-TRIP evaluates the effectiveness of a model for improvement for increasing this proportion.
