AIM: A recent study of unplanned reoperation within 28 days after colorectal surgery in England found a mean rate of 6.5% and suggested that this be used as a performance indicator. We aimed to find the unplanned 30 day reoperation rate for patients having colorectal cancer surgery in NHS Lanarkshire. METHOD: This retrospective study identified all patients having surgery for colorectal cancer in NHS Lanarkshire between 2006-2008 from a prospective colorectal cancer database. Scottish Morbidity Record (SMR01) data were then examined for each patient to determine whether they returned to the operating theatre within 30 days of the index procedure. RESULTS: 573 patients had a primary operation for colorectal cancer during the period. The unplanned rate of reoperation within 30 days of surgery was 5.4%. There was no statistically significant difference between the hospital site, emergency or elective operation or laparoscopic resection or laparotomy. There was no statistically significant difference in reoperation rate between colorectal and general surgeons. CONCLUSION: The rate of unplanned reoperation in NHS Lanarkshire compares favourably to that of England however similar methodological problems exist. The accuracy of the data is dependent on coding and entry. © 2013 The Authors. Colorectal Disease © 2013 The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland.
