 AIM: In patients with two-stage hepatectomy (TSH) for multiple bilobar liver metastases from colorectal cancer, few clinical series compare functional remnant hypertrophy of the liver volume between right portal vein ligation (PVL) and embolisation (PVE). Our objective is to analyse the effectiveness of portal vein ligation to achieve hypertrophy of the functional remnant volume (FRV) of the liver and to compare the results with portal vein embolisation in a series of patients with multiple bilobar liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between September 2001 and September 2011 we performed a TSH in 41 patients with multiple bilobar colorectal liver metastases. A right PVL was performed in 23 patients with an insufficient FRV (three patients did not complete the second stage due to tumour progression and were excluded). We prospectively compare these results with the increased remnant volume obtained in 18 patients with right PVE. RESULTS: The median FRV was higher in the patients with PVE, rising from 501 ml (range 309-703) to 636 ml (range 387-649), than those with PVL, rising from 510 ml (range 203-824) to 595 ml (range 313-1213) (p < 0.05). The median %FRVI was higher in the patients with PVE (median 40%; range 21-65%) than those with PVL (median 30%; range 21-60%) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: PVL and PVE were effective in all cases for obtaining hypertrophy of the FRV before major liver resection. Right PVE obtains better results and should be used where necessary to achieve a further increase in volume.
