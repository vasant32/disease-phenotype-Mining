 PURPOSE: Mutations in PIK3CA [the gene encoding the p110α catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)] play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis. Experimental evidence suggests that PIK3CA exon 9 and exon 20 mutations trigger different biologic effects, and that concomitant mutations in both exons 9 and 20 synergistically enhance tumorigenic effects. Thus, we hypothesized that PIK3CA exon 9 and exon 20 mutations might have differential effects on clinical outcome in colorectal cancer, and that concomitant PIK3CA exon 9 and 20 mutations might confer aggressive tumor behavior. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We sequenced PIK3CA by pyrosequencing in 1,170 rectal and colon cancers in two prospective cohort studies, and found 189 (16%) PIK3CA mutated tumors. Mortality HR according to PIK3CA status was computed using Cox proportional hazards model, adjusting for clinical and molecular features, including microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, LINE-1 methylation, and BRAF and KRAS mutations. RESULTS: Compared with PIK3CA wild-type cases, patients with concomitant PIK3CA mutations in exons 9 and 20 experienced significantly worse cancer-specific survival [log-rank P = 0.031; multivariate HR = 3.51; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.28-9.62] and overall survival (log-rank P = 0.0008; multivariate HR = 2.68; 95% CI: 1.24-5.77). PIK3CA mutation in either exon 9 or 20 alone was not significantly associated with patient survival. No significant interaction of PIK3CA mutation with BRAF or KRAS mutation was observed in survival analysis. CONCLUSION: Coexistence of PIK3CA (the PI3K p110α subunit) exon 9 and 20 mutations, but not PIK3CA mutation in either exon 9 or 20 alone, is associated with poor prognosis of colorectal cancer patients.
