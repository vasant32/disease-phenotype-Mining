Aim:  The Wales-Trent Bowel Cancer Audit (WTBA) was carried out in 1993 and since 2001 Welsh Bowel Cancer Audits (WBCA) have taken place annually. Screening for bowel cancer in Wales was introduced in 2008. This study compared patient variables, the role of surgery and operative mortality rates over the 15-year interval between the WTBA and the last WBCA before the introduction population screening. Method:  Data from the WTBA in 1993 were compared with those of the WBCA including patients diagnosed between April 2007 and March 2008. Results:  In 1993, 1536 patients were diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) against 1793 in 2007/8. Patient demographics and ASA did not change during these periods. Surgical treatment for CRC declined (93% in 1993 vs 80% in 2007/8 (p<0.001) particularly in the use of resectional surgery (84% in 1993 vs 71% in 2007/8; p<0.001). The 30-day postoperative mortality rate fell from 7.4% in 1993 to 5.9% in 2007/8, (p=0.097). Advanced disease at operation was more prevalent in the WTBA (25% of all operated patients were Stage IV in 1993 vs 13% in 2007/8 [p<0.001]). The use of surgery in patients with metastatic disease also declined over this period. Conclusion:  Surgery is used less frequently in the management of CRC compared with fifteen years previously. and is a factor in the reduction of the interpreted thirty-day operative mortality. © 2012 The Authors Colorectal Disease © 2012 The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland.
