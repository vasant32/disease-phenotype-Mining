 INTRODUCTION: Liver resection is proved to offer potential long-term survival for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). Accurate radiological assessment is vital to enable an appropriate surgical approach. The role of intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) has been controversial. This study was designed to analyse the accuracy of IOUS compared with that of preoperative imaging (POI) in these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective analysis of 51 consecutive patients who underwent liver resection for CRLM was undertaken. The accuracy of POI and IOUS were correlated and compared with histopathological analysis. Statistical analyses included t-tests, to compare continuous variables, and chi-square and Fisher's exact tests to compare categorical variables. p<0.05 was considered significant RESULTS: POI correlated with histology in 35 patients (68.6%). The sensitivity and specificity were 82.4% and 86.3% respectively. IOUS correlated with histology in 31 (60.8%) patients. The sensitivity and specificity were 84.3% and 76.5% respectively. There was no difference in accuracy between modalities. The accuracy of POI combined with IOUS correlated with histology in 40 patients (78.4%). The sensitivity and specificity were 88.2% and 84.3% respectively. The accuracy of combined modalities was significantly greater than IOUS or POI alone. CONCLUSIONS: POI combined with IOUS may significantly increase the diagnostic accuracy of patients undergoing liver resection for CRLM.
