Macrocyclic compounds bearing a 2-amino-6-arylpyrimidine moiety were identified as potent heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors by modification of 2-amino-6-aryltriazine derivative (CH5015765). We employed a macrocyclic structure as a skeleton of new inhibitors to mimic the geldanamycin-Hsp90 interactions. Among the identified inhibitors, CH5164840 showed high binding affinity for N-terminal Hsp90α (K(d)=0.52nM) and strong anti-proliferative activity against human cancer cell lines (HCT116 IC(50)=0.15μM, NCI-N87 IC(50)=0.066μM). CH5164840 displayed high oral bioavailability in mice (F=70.8%) and potent antitumor efficacy in a HCT116 human colorectal cancer xenograft model (tumor growth inhibition=83%).
