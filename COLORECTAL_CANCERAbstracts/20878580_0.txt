 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs (RECK), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) in colorectal cancer. METHODS: S-P immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of RECK, MMP-9 and VEGF-C in colorectal cancer specimen. Colorectal mucosal tissue at least 10 cm away from the tumor was used as control. RESULTS: The positive expression of RECK in colorectal cancer was significantly lower than that in the controls(53.3% vs. 100%, P<0.05). Both MMP-9 and VEGF-C were over expressed compared with the controls(86.7% vs. 23.3% and 71.7% vs. 13.3% respectively, P<0.01). The expression of RECK was negatively correlated with that of MMP-9 and VEGF-C, and the expression of MMP-9 was positively correlated with that of VEGF-C. There were significant associations between the expression of these proteins and lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and TNM staging (all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: RECK expression is low in colorectal cancer, while MMP-9 and VEGF-C expressions are high. Combined testing of these 3 markers is important in the evaluation of tumor metastasis and invasion, and is helpful in the prediction of the prognosis.
