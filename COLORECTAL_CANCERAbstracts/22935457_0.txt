 THE AIM OF THE STUDY: Was an evaluation of conversion causes and intraoperative difficulties in patients treated with laparoscopic surgery due to colorectal tumours on the basis of authors' own material. MATERIAL AND METHODS: in the period 2009-2012 160 patients were operated on because of large bowel cancer, 79 women and 81 men. Average age of patients was 66 years. The conversion was recognized as desuflation of peritoneal cavity, trocars removal and making laparotomy. RESULTS: The conversion was made in 22 cases (13,7%). More in men (16.1%) than in women. The conversion was made twice as likely in T3 and T4 tumors than in T1 and T2. CONCLUSIONS: The main cause of conversion in laparoscopic operations of colorectal cancer is local tumor progression.
