We investigated the role of fasting hormones and pro-inflammatory cytokines in cancer patients. Hormones (ghrelin, adiponectin, and leptin) and cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-6) were measured by ELISA or RIA in lung cancer and colorectal cancer patients before the administration of cancer therapy, and measurements were repeated every 2 months for 6 months. From June 2006 to August 2008, 42 patients (19 with colorectal cancer and 23 with lung cancer) were enrolled. In total, 21 patients were included in the cachexia group and the others served as a comparison group. No significant difference in the initial adiponectin, ghrelin, TNF-α, IFN-γ, or IL-6 level was observed between groups, although leptin was significantly lower in cachectic patients than in the comparison group (15.3 ± 19.5 vs 80.9 ± 99.0 pg/mL, P = 0.007). During the follow-up, the patients who showed a > 5% weight gain had higher ghrelin levels after 6 months. Patients exhibiting elevated IL-6 levels typically showed a weight loss > 5% after 6 months. A blunted adiponectin or ghrelin response to weight loss may contribute to cancer cachexia and IL-6 may be responsible for inducing and maintaining cancer cachexia.
