Cetuximab, a chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor, is indicated for the treatment of epidermal growth factor receptor-expressing metastatic colorectal cancer and recurrent or metastatic squamous cell cancer of the head and neck after failure of platinum-based therapy. The commonly reported side effects of cetuximab are infusion-related reactions, skin rash, fatigue, malaise and nausea. We report a case of aseptic meningitis developing as a rare side effect in a patient of stage IVB squamous maxillary cancer treated with cetuximab. To our knowledge, there have been very few cases of cetuximab-induced aseptic meningitis reported in literature. Clinicians should recognize that self-limiting aseptic meningitis can occur with administration of cetuximab. Our case report may serve as an additional reference for clinicians encountered with aseptic meningitis in the setting of using cetuximab.
