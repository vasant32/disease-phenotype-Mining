The development of effective therapies for the prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastasis is of great importance. Recently, chitosan (CS) nanoparticles have been utilized as carriers of interluekin-12 (IL-12) administered locally to deliver therapeutic proteins and genes. In this study, we encapsulated IL-12 by incorporation using tripolyphosphate (TPP) as the coacervated crosslinking agent to form CS-TPP/IL-12 nanoparticles. We further characterized the association efficiency, rate of release, liver-targeting, and toxicity, which were predominantly dependent on the factors of particle size, zeta potential, pH of solution, and whether or not modified with TPP. Systemic delivery of CS-TPP/IL-12 nanoparticles significantly reduced the number and volume of CRC liver metastasis foci compared to the CS-TPP treated mouse group. Although delivery of IL-12 alone also inhibited the number of CRC liver metastasis observed, further study of the change in hepatic metastasis volume demonstrated no significant differences between the groups treated with CS-TPP or IL-12 alone. Mechanistically, CS-TPP nanoparticles blocked the toxicity of IL-12 and induced infiltration of NK cells and some T cells, which are most likely the effector cells that mediate tumor metastasis inhibition during CS-TPP/IL-12 immunotherapy. The results obtained from this study demonstrate the potential benefit of using chitosan modification technology as a cytokine delivery system for the successful prevention of CRC liver metastasis by exploiting liver immunity.
