 OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether cytochalasin D can induce antitumor activities in a tumor model. METHODS: Murine CT26 colorectal carcinoma cells were cultured in vitro and cytochalasin D was used as a cytotoxic agent to detect its capabilities of inhibiting CT26 cell proliferation and inducing cell apoptosis by MTT and a TUNEL-based apoptosis assay. Murine CT26 tumor model was established to observe the tumor growth and survival time. Tumor tissues were used to detect the microvessel density by immunohistochemistry. In addition, alginate encapsulated tumor cell assay was used to quantify the tumor angiogenesis in vivo. RESULTS: Cytochalasin D inhibited CT26 tumor cell proliferation in time and dose dependent manner and induced significant CT26 cell apoptosis, which almost reached the level induced by the positive control nuclease. The optimum effective dose of cytochalasin D for in vivo therapy was about 50 mg/kg. Cytochalasin D in vivo treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged the survival times in CT26 tumor-bearing mice. The results of immunohistochemistry analysis and alginate encapsulation assay indicated that the cytochalasin D could effectively inhibited tumor angiogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Cytochalasin D inhibits CT26 tumor growth potentially through inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of cell apoptosis and suppression of tumor angiogenesis.
