 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the surgical outcomes after transumbilical single-port access laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer. METHODS: Patients undergoing transumbilical single-port access laparoscopic radical resection for colorectal cancer at the Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University were included. RESULTS: Three patients underwent transumbilical single-port access laparoscopic radical resection for sigmoid colon cancer and 1 for rectal cancer between August 2010 and September 2010. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. No conversion was required. The mean operative time was 206 min and the mean estimated blood loss was 75 ml. The mean number of harvested lymph nodes was 21. Patients were ambulatory in the same day of surgery or postoperative day 1. Length of hospital stay ranged from 7 to 10 days. CONCLUSIONS: Transumbilical single-port access laparoscopic surgery is safe for colorectal cancer. Long-term outcomes warrant further investigation.
