 AIM: Elevated circulating endothelin-1 (ET-1) has been demonstrated in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of this study was to examine the prognostic value of plasma big ET-1, the stable precursor of ET-1, in cancer-specific survival in patients having curative surgery for CRC. METHOD: Seventy-seven patients undergoing potentially curative surgery for CRC between January 2000 and January 2001 were studied. Clinicopathological data were obtained from a prospectively maintained database including long-term follow-up information (median follow up 84 months). The influence of plasma big ET-1 and clinicopathological variables upon over cancer-specific survival was determined by univariate and multivariable analysis. RESULTS: On univariate analysis, advanced Dukes' stage, tumour size and patient age were associated with shortened overall survival. Advanced Dukes' stage was the only factor associated with shortened survival on multivariable analysis. Plasma big ET-1 showed no association with either overall or cancer-specific survival following CRC resection. CONCLUSION: Plasma big ET-1 appears to have no prognostic value in primary CRC.
