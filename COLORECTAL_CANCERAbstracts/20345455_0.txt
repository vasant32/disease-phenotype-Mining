Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancer diagnoses and undergoing colorectal cancer surgery is reported to be associated with physical symptoms and psychological reactions. Social support is described as important during the postoperative period. The purpose of this paper was to describe how patients experience the early postoperative period after colorectal cancer surgery. Interviews according a phenomenological approach were performed with 13 adult participants, within 1 week after discharge from hospital. Data were collected from August 2006 to February 2007. Analysis of the interview transcripts was conducted according to Giorgi. The essence of the phenomenon was to regain control over ones body in the early postoperative period after colorectal cancer surgery. Lack of control, fear of wound and anastomosis rupture, insecurity according to complications was prominent findings. When caring for these patients it is a challenge to be sensitive, encourage and promote patients to express their feelings and needs. One possibility to empower the patients and give support could be a follow up phone call within a week after discharge.
