 PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to investigate the possibility of reducting vascular pain with peripheral vein administration of oxaliplatin (L-OHP)by heating infusion routes during XELOX therapy. METHODS: (1) Experiment: The temperature of the 5%glucose injection solution was measured at the leading edge of the infusion route when it was heated to 36°Cor 40°C. (2) CASES: Among five patients receving XELOX therapy for colorectal cancer, we examined the occurrence of vascular pain by heating the L-OHP solution to 40°C. RESULTS: (1) Experiment: The injection temperatures were reduced to 25°C and 31°C while passing through the infusion route when L-OHP solution was heated to 36°C and 40°C, respectively. (2) CASE: vascular pain did not occur in all five patients treated with XELOX therapy completely by heating the L-OHP solution at 40°C, including two patients who could not continue treatment caused by vascular pain without the heating method. CONCLUSION: The method using the heat infusion route of L-OHP at 40°C is useful for reducing vascular pain from L-OHP administered intravenously.
