 BACKGROUND: There are various computed tomographic appearances of liver metastases from colorectal cancer, but there is little data in Thailand. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This was a retrospective, descriptive study of the CT appearances of 21 patients diagnosed with liver metastasis from colorectal cancer in Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen, between January 2003 and December 2007. All of the patients were examined in the portovenous phases. RESULTS: Rim-enhancement was seen in 20 patients (95.2%). Irregular rim-enhancement was seen in 19 patients (90.5%) and smooth rim-enhancement in one (4.8%). Thin rim was seen in 16 patients (76.2%) and thick rim in four (19%). Internal heterogeneous enhancement was seen in 15 patients (71.4%). Irregular, thin rim-enhancement with internal heterogeneous enhancement was the most common combination seen in 12 patients (57.1%). CONCLUSION: An enhancing rim could be seen in 95.2% of patients. Internal heterogeneous enhancement was shown in 71.4% of patients. Familiarity with the various CT appearances may help to facilitate the diagnosis of colorectal liver metastases.
