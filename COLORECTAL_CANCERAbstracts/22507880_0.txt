 AIM: Elevated levels of von Willebrand factor (VWF) are often observed in many diseases including colorectal cancer, but this finding is not definite. The aim of our study was to examine the change in VWF multimer distribution in patients with colorectal cancer. METHOD: We randomly selected nine patients from each of the four Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) stages of colon cancer. VWF antigen (VWF:Ag), VWF-cleaving protease ADAMTS-13 level and factor VIII activity (FVIII:C) were determined. The multimer distribution of VWF was visualized using electrophoretic multimer analysis. RESULTS: The VWF multimer structure was normal with no difference between the four UICC stages. There was no significant increase in VWF:Ag and FVIII:C levels in the more advanced UICC stages. There was no significant difference in the ADAMTS-13 level according to the UICC stage. CONCLUSION: There was no change in the VWF multimer distribution to indicate acquired von Willebrand disease.
