 AIM: Management of malignant colorectal polyps (MCP) is contentious, with no randomized controlled trials comparing endoscopic with surgical management. This study reviews the management and outcomes of MCPs across a UK region. METHOD: Patients with a malignant polyp were identified using the NORCCAG (NORthern Colorectal Cancer Audit Group) database between April 2006 and July 2010. All histopathology reports and follow-up procedures were reviewed. RESULTS: Of 386 patients identified, 165 (42.7%) had the polyp biopsied and 221 (57.3%) had an endoscopic local excision (37 piecemeal excision, 184 polypectomy). All patients having an endoscopic biopsy underwent surgery. 103 (46.6%) having a local excision had follow-up surgery, of whom 79 (76.7%) had no residual cancer. Of the 118 patients managed endoscopically, none had residual cancer on follow-up endoscopy. The 21 (5.4%) Dukes C cancers were associated with Kikuchi SM3/Haggitt 4 lesions (χ(2) =10.85, P=0.005) and lesions with an involved/unsure excision margin (χ(2) =7.44, P=0.017). Predictors of finding residual tumour at surgery after local excision were Kikuchi SM3/Haggitt Level 4 (χ(2) =17.07, P<0.001) and an involved/unsure excision margin (χ(2) =20.45, P<0.001). An excision margin >0 mm was associated with the finding of no residual tumour (χ(2) =25.21, P<0.001). There was no difference in survival between surgical and endoscopic management (χ(2) =0.634, P=0.426) after a mean follow-up of 25.1 months. CONCLUSION: Endoscopic management of a subgroup of MCPs appears safe. A clear resection margin (>0 mm) appears sufficient to avoid surgery, except in locally advanced lesions (Kikuchi 3/Haggitt 4) which have a greater risk of residual cancer at surgery and lymph node metastasis.
