Systemic therapeutic efficacy is central to determining the outcome of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. In these patients, there is a critical need for predictive biomarkers to optimize efficacy while minimizing toxicity. The integration of a new generation of molecularly targeted drugs into the treatment of colorectal cancer, coupled with the development of sophisticated technologies for individual tumours as well as patient molecular profiling, underline the potential for personalized medicine. In this review we focus on the latest progress made within the genomic and proteomic fields concerning predictive biomarkers for individualized therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer.
