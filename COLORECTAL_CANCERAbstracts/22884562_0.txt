Colorectal cancer (CRC) is primarily a lifestyle disease of the western world. As such it can be likened to cardiovascular disease and indeed it shares many of the same risk factors. It is therefore perhaps unsurprising that cholesterol metabolism and colorectal cancer are also intricately linked. Many of the initial studies suggesting a link between dietary cholesterol, blood cholesterol levels and cholesterol lowering drugs were performed more than a decade ago. The most recent insights in this field are the result of meta-analyses, advances in pharmacogenetics and the new field of molecular pathological epidemiology. This review summarises the current evidence linking cholesterol metabolism with colorectal cancer including the suggested underlying molecular causes and the implications for colorectal cancer prevention.
