 PURPOSE: Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) measurements performed preoperatively and during the early postoperative period were examined prospectively to assess their prognostic value for colorectal cancer (CRC) patients receiving curative surgery. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2004, 1,361 patients with CRC who underwent curative surgery at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital were enrolled prospectively. CEA was measured prior to surgery and during the third or fourth postoperative week. The endpoint was length of postoperative disease-free survival, and prognostic importance was determined using the log-rank test and Cox regression hazard model. RESULTS: Six hundred (44.1%) CRC patients had high CEA concentrations preoperatively, and 188 (13.8%) patients retained high values postoperatively. Within the median follow-up period of 61 (6-108) months, CRC recurred in 313 patients. By univariate analysis TNM staging, tumor differentiation, lymphovascular invasion, preoperative CEA concentration, and postoperative CEA concentration affected the outcome. By multivariate analysis, the prognostic importance of postoperative CEA was retained (95% CI, 1.73-3.01; HR = 2.28) but that of preoperative CEA was lost (95% CI, 0.82-1.33; HR = 1.05). CRC recurred earlier in patients with high postoperative CEA concentrations; metastasis to the liver was common (72.3%) among patients in this group. CONCLUSIONS: Early postoperative CEA concentration is an independent prognostic factor for CRC. Patients with high postoperative CEA values should receive aggressive follow-up examinations for early relapse of CRC, with special attention paid to recurrence at the liver.
