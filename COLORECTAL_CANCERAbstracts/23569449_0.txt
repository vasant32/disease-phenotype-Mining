It has been reported that many colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with synchronous or metachronous liver metastases underwent surgery subsequent to neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy with folinic acid, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI), or capecitabine and oxaliplatin (XELOX). However, there are very few reports of the use of capecitabine and irinotecan (XELIRI). We herein report a successfully resected case of recurrent lung and liver metastases of rectal cancer treated with combination chemotherapy with XELIRI + bevacizumab (BV) therapy. A 63-year-old male developed recurrence of a solitary nodule in the right lower lobe of the lung and multiple liver metastases after low anterior resection for rectal cancer 1 year previously. Partial resection of the right lower lobe of the lung was performed and treatment with XELIRI + BV was initiated. A computed tomography scan revealed a reduction in tumor size without any new lesions after four cycles of XELIRI + BV therapy. Partial hepatectomy of S1, S5, and S7 was safely performed. The patient is now undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy and has been free from recurrence for 18 months following surgery. There are only few studies with relatively low patient numbers reporting on the outcome after resection of both pulmonary and hepatic metastases of CRC. We therefore report a patient who underwent sequential resection of pulmonary and hepatic metastases with XELIRI + BV therapy.
