PURPOSE: Over expression of tissue factor (TF) occurs in more than 50Â % of colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, TF represents an attractive target antigen for immunotherapy in CRC. METHODS: Here, we assessed the safety and efficacy of a recombinant adenovirus vector encoding the light chain of human coagulation factor VII (hfVII-LC) and human IgG1 Fc fragment (hIgG1-Fc), termed "benc vector," by targeting TF in the mouse model with colon cancer. Benc vector was administered intravenously or intratumorally in SCID mice with TF over-expressing HT-29 colon cancer. The safety and efficacy of benc vector were observed during animal experiments. RESULTS: Complete inhibition of tumor growth (5/5) was observed not only in the intravenously injection of benc vector group but also in the intratumorally of benc vector group. We also observed a precautionary effect on lung metastases of HT-29 cells by intratumoral injection of benc vector. In the control group of animals given empty control vector, all animals (5/5) developed lung tumors and exhibited a higher number of nodules after injection with HT-29 cells via the tail vein. In contrast, only three animals (3/5) in the treatment group receiving benc vector had any observable lung metastases and a lower number of nodules. No animals died and no bleeding was observed both in treatment groups and control groups. Moreover, only moderate liver damage was detected in mice receiving benc vector by intravenous injections. CONCLUSIONS: Benc vector encoding hfVII-LC and hIgG1-Fc can effectively inhibit tumor growth and metastases in SCID mice with TF over-expressing colon cancer and shows promise as an agent for CRC immunotherapy.
