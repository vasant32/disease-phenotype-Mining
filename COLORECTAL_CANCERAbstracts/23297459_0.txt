P53 gene mutations and the abnormal P53 protein can introduce the production to P53 antibody. A large number of studies showed that serum levels of P53 antibody had the correlation with the prognosis of patients with different cancers, the lymph node invasion and metastasis of colorectal cancer, and its recurrence after the curative resection. And it is possible for its application in predicting the early recurrence and metastasis in colorectal cancer after the curative resection.However, there are still a lot of work needed to be done before its use in the clinical settings.
