 INTRODUCTION: Colonoscopy of asymptomatic, healthy individuals for colorectal cancer screening rarely causes complications and adverse events. Thus, quality of life (QOL) of the participants should not be affected by the procedure. AIM: The aim of the study was to isolate the influence of colonoscopy, by investigation QOL before and after the procedure in a cohort of consecutive patients with different indications. METHODS: This study is a prospective, longitudinal study, designed to compare the potential influence of colonoscopy on QOL. For a cohort of consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy for various reasons and indications, we filled a QOL short form-36 and a short feedback questionnaire before, immediately after, and a month after the procedure. We also measured the quality of the endoscopy, the outcome in patients, and acceptability among patients. RESULTS: There was no significant change before and immediately after colonoscopy in any of the short form-36 parameters. Physical functioning, role limitation physical, pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role limitation mental, and mental health had very similar scores before and 2-3 h after the procedure. There was a decrease in the physical functioning a month after the procedure (P=0.01). The same was found for non-inflammatory bowel disease patients, but not for inflammatory bowel disease patients. CONCLUSION: Colonoscopy did not affect QOL in the short or the long duration after the procedure. As such, colonoscopy may be suitable as a part of screening programs. We believe that QOL estimation should be an integral part of assessment of a screening program.
