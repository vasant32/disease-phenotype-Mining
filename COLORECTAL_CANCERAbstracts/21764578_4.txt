 PURPOSE: To investigate the expression status and clinical implications of stem cell genes CD133 and CD44 in the colorectal cancers with early liver metastasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The differential genes of early liver metastases in colorectal cancer were detected by RT(2) Profiler™ PCR Array. The expression and the relationship of stem cell gene CD133 and CD44 were analyzed by immunofluorescent tests. RESULTS: CD133 and CD44 were significantly higher co-expressed in colorectal cancer with early liver metastases compared to those without early liver metastases, and the content of CD133 and CD44 proteins decreased following growth of the transplanted tumors. Of the 80 cases without early liver metastases, 12 were observed CD133 and CD44 proteins co-expression, while 36 of the 40 cases with early liver metastases were found CD133 and CD44 proteins co-expression (15% vs. 90%, P < 0.05). Survival analysis revealed CD133 and CD44 proteins co-expression was associated with poorest prognosis (57.14% vs. 87.41%, X(2) = 48.49, P = 0.001). After Cox regression, age, Duck's stage, lymph node metastasis, and CD133 and CD44 proteins co-expression were shown to be the independent prognostic factors of colorectal cancers. CONCLUSIONS: CD133 and CD44 proteins were highly co-expressed in colorectal cancer with early liver metastases, and may be a potential biomarker for the early liver metastases.
