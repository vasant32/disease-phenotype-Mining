 BACKGROUND: Myocardial infarction and colorectal cancer are associated at the population level and in autoptic studies. Glycated apolipoprotein B (apoB) is a risk factor for the development of myocardial infarction. The association of glycated apoB with dysplastic and neoplastic colorectal tissue was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight consecutive surgical specimens, 26 colorectal adenomas and 22 colorectal carcinomas, retrieved from the archives of the Pathologic Anatomy Department of our institution, were examined. The tissue content of glycated apoB was determined using a monoclonal antibody. RESULTS: Glycated apoB was detected in 27% of the adenomas and 45% of the cancer tissue, but only in 18% of the normal tissue near the cancer site. CONCLUSION: Glycated apoB is associated with dysplastic and even more so with neoplastic cancer tissue.
