Studies investigating the association between cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) Asn453Ser (453 A/G, rs1800440) polymorphism and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk report conflicting results. The aim of this study was to quantitatively summarize the evidence for such a relationship. Two investigators independently searched the Medline and Embase Databases. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for CYP1B1 polymorphism and CRC were calculated in a fixed-effects model (the Mantel-Haenszel method) and a random-effects model (the DerSimonian and Laird method) when appropriate. The pooled ORs were performed for co-dominant model (GG vs AA, GA vs AA), dominant model (GG+GA vs AA), and recessive model (GG vs GA+AA). This meta-analysis included 7 case-control studies, which included 6375 CRC cases and 7003 controls. Overall, the variant genotypes (GG and GA) of the 453 A/G were not associated with CRC risk when compared with the wild-type AA homozygote (GG vs AA, OR=0.94, 95% CI=0.77-1.14; GA vs AA, OR=0.99, 95% CI=0.87-1.12). Similarly, no associations were found in the dominant and recessive models (dominant model, OR=0.98, 95% CI=0.87-1.09; recessive model, OR=0.94, 95% CI=0.77-1.14). When stratifying for country, study sample size, matched control and source of controls, no evidence of significant association was observed in any subgroup, except among those studies from "Canada". No publication bias was found in the present study. No association was found between the CYP1B1 Asn453Ser polymorphism and risk of CRC among Caucasians.
