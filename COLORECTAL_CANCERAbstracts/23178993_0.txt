PURPOSE: Surveillance colonoscopy is undertaken after resection of colorectal cancer to detect and treat local recurrence and metachronous lesions, with the aim of improving survival. This study aimed to clarify the current timing of surveillance colonoscopies and evaluate the rates of local recurrence and metachronous tumors. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 459 patients who underwent surveillance colonoscopy at our institution after curative resection of colorectal cancer. The number and timing of surveillance colonoscopies, incidence of local recurrence and metachronous lesions, pathological findings of lesions, treatment of lesions, and outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: The first surveillance colonoscopy was undertaken at 6-18 months after surgery in 73 % of patients. Local recurrence was detected in three cases (0.7 %), all during the first surveillance colonoscopy, which was performed >1 year after surgery. These three patients all underwent additional surgery and were alive 5 years later. Invasive metachronous cancers were detected in six patients (1.3 %) at 18-57 months after surgery, and advanced adenomas were detected in 30 patients. CONCLUSION: Considering the low incidence of postoperative lesions and the timing of lesion detection, reducing the number of surveillance colonoscopies after surgery for colorectal cancer may be appropriate.
