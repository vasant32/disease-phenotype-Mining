 INTRODUCTION: Plasma from the second and third weeks after minimally invasive colorectal resection (MICR) has high levels of the proangiogenic proteins VEGF and angiopoietin 2 and also stimulates, in vitro, endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and migration, which are critical to wound and tumor angiogenesis. Soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) stimulates EC chemotaxis and angiogenesis. The impact of MICR on blood levels of sVCAM-1 is unknown. This study's purpose was to determine plasma sVCAM-1 levels after MICR in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. METHODS: Blood samples from 90 patients (26% rectal, 74% colon) were obtained preoperatively, on postoperative days (POD) 1 and 3, and at other points during the next 2 months. The late samples were bundled into 7-day time blocks. sVCAM-1 levels were determined in duplicate via ELISA and reported as ng/ml. Student's t test was used for data analysis (significance, P < 0.008 after Bonferroni correction). RESULTS: The mean incision length was 7.3 ± 3.1 cm, and the conversion rate was 3%. Compared with preoperative (PreOp) levels (811.3 ± 233.2), the mean plasma sVCAM-1 level was significantly higher on POD 1 (905.7 ± 292.4, P < 0.001) and POD 3 (977.7 ± 271.8, P < 0.001). Levels remained significantly elevated for the POD 7-13, POD 14-20, POD 21-27, and POD 28-67 time blocks. CONCLUSIONS: MICR for CRC is associated with a persistent increase in plasma sVCAM-1 levels during the first month. This sustained increase may promote angiogenesis and stimulate the growth of residual tumor cells early after surgery.
