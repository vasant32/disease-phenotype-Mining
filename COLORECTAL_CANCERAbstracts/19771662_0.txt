Danish rectal cancer patients previously had an inferior prognosis compared with the other Scandinavian countries. An analysis of overall and relative survival in 1994-2006 was based on the Danish Colorectal Cancer Group's national colorectal cancer databases and the Central Population Registry. The 5-year overall survival in 10,632 operated patients increased from 37% to 51% and the 5-year relative survival rose from 46% to 62%. In conclusion, the prognosis improved considerably mainly due to implementation of total mesorectal excision, improved preoperative staging and centralised surgical treatment.
