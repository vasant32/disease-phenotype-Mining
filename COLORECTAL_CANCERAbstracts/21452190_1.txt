 BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to determine the association between short- and long-term outcomes and deprivation for patients undergoing operative treatment for colorectal cancer in the Northern Region of England. METHODS: This was a retrospective analytical study based on the Northern Region Colorectal Cancer Audit Group database for the period 1998-2002. The Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004, an area-based measure, was recalibrated and used to quantify deprivation. Patients were ranked based on their postcode of residence and grouped into five categories. RESULTS: Of 8159 patients in total, 7352 (90·1 per cent) had surgery; 6953 (94·6 per cent) of the 7352 patients underwent tumour resection and 4935 (67·7 per cent) of 7294 had a margin-negative (R0) resection. Deprivation was not associated with age, sex, tumour site, stage or other tumour-related factors. Compared with the most affluent group, the most deprived patients had fewer elective operations (72·9 versus 76·4 per cent; P = 0·014), more adverse co-morbidity (P < 0·001) and fewer curative resections (65·5 versus 71·2 per cent; P < 0·001). In multivariable analysis, deprivation was not an independent predictor of postoperative death (odds ratio (OR) 0·72, 95 per cent confidence interval 0·48 to 1·06; P = 0·101) but it was a predictor of curative resection (OR 1·24, 1·01 to 1·52; P = 0·042), overall survival (HR 0·83, 0·73 to 0·95; P = 0·006) and relative survival (HR 0·74, 0·58 to 0·95; P = 0·023). CONCLUSION: Deprivation, both independently and by influencing other surgical predictors, impacts on short- and long-term outcomes of patients with colorectal cancer.
