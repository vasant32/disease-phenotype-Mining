 OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the immune function in patients with colorectal cancer after laparoscopic surgery (LS) and conventional open surgery (OS). METHODS: PUBMED, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library were searched and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the immunological difference between LS and OS were included. Two authors extracted data and assessed trial quality. RESULTS: Eleven studies including 695 patients were analysed. Immune-competent cells demonstrated no significant differences between LS and OS in six trials. Eight trials assessed various perioperative plasma cytokine concentrations with no significant differences in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels between LS and OS. However, meta-analysis showed higher T suppressor lymphocytes (CD8+) counts on postoperative days (POD) 1-3 and lower plasma levels of CRP on POD 0-1 in LS group compared with OS group. CONCLUSION: Although LS groups displayed higher T suppressor lymphocyte (CD8+) counts on postoperative days (POD) 1-3 and lower plasma levels of CRP on POD 0-1, there is no sufficient evidence to support superior preservation of global immune function with LS compared to OS.
