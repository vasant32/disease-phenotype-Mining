Directed cell migration and axonal guidance are essential steps in neural development that share many molecular mechanisms. The guidance of developing axons and migrating neurons is likely to depend on the precise control of plasmalemma turnover in selected regions of leading edges and growth cones, respectively. Previous results provided evidence of a signaling mechanism that couples chemotropic deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC)/Netrin-1 axonal guidance and exocytosis through Syntaxin1(Sytx1)/TI-VAMP SNARE proteins. Here we studied whether Netrin-1-dependent neuronal migration relies on a similar SNARE mechanism. We show that migrating neurons in the lower rhombic lip (LRL) express several SNARE proteins, and that DCC co-associates with Sytx1 and TI-VAMP in these cells. We also demonstrate that cleavage of Sytx1 by botulinum toxin C1 (BoNT/C1) abolishes Netrin-1-dependent chemoattraction of migrating neurons, and that interference of Sytx1 functions with shRNAs or Sytx1-dominant negatives disrupts Netrin-1-dependent chemoattraction of LRL neurons. These findings indicate that a Sytx1/DCC interaction is required for Netrin-1 guidance of migrating neurons, thereby highlighting a relationship between guidance signaling and SNARE proteins that regulate membrane turnover.
