The precise relationship between GCF2 expression and carcinogenesis has not yet been established. To clarify the metastatic potential of GCF2 in colorectal cancer, HT-29 cells stably suppressing GCF2 expression were injected into the spleens of severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. GCF2 suppression reduced the number of metastatic foci in the liver and reduced fibronectin-induced cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. Downstream from the integrin signaling pathways, GCF2 regulates RhoA interaction with the RGS domain of Leukemia associated RhoGEF (LARG). Altogether, our results suggest that GCF2 plays an important role in colorectal cancer metastasis by regulating RhoA-induced cell adhesion, migration, and invasion.
