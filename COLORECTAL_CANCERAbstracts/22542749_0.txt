 BACKGROUND & AIMS: Colorectal cancer (CRC) has a high prevalence among the US Hispanic population. In Puerto Rico, CRC is the third leading cause of cancer death in men and the second in women. There are limited published data on the prevalence of colorectal neoplasia (CRN) among the US Hispanic population. We determined the prevalence of CRN (colorectal adenomas and cancer) among asymptomatic, Hispanic subjects who were screened in Puerto Rico and evaluated risk factors associated with CRN. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of the medical, endoscopic, and pathology records of individuals who underwent first-time screening colonoscopies at an ambulatory gastroenterology practice from January 1, 2008, to December 1, 2009. The prevalence of CRN (overall and advanced), documented by colonoscopy and pathology reports, was calculated for the complete cohort and by sex. RESULTS: Of the 745 Hispanic individuals who underwent screening colonoscopies during the study period, the prevalence for overall CRN was 25.1% and for advanced CRN (â‰¥ 1 cm and/or with advanced histology) was 4.0%. The prevalence of CRN was higher for men than women (32.0% vs 20.6%; P = .001; odds ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-2.6). CRN was more frequently located in the proximal colon (67.7% proximal vs 32.3% distal). A family history of CRC was associated with advanced CRN (odds ratio, 2.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-6.79). CONCLUSIONS: CRN was more common among Hispanic men than women and increased with age. CRNs among Hispanic individuals were predominantly located in the proximal colon. These findings indicate that there are ethnic and sex disparities in patterns of CRN that might be related to genomic admixture and have important implications for screening algorithms for Hispanic individuals.
