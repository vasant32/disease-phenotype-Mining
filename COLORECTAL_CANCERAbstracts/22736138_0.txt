 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of SNCG in colorectal cancer with liver metastasis and its clinical significance. METHODS: Surgical specimens were collected from 217 colorectal cancer patients with complete clinical and follow up data between January 1999 and December 2003. There were 113 cases with liver metastasis and 104 without liver metastasis. SNCG expression was identified by immunohistochemistry. Association of SNCG expression with clinicopathologic factors and prognosis of colorectal cancer was accessed. RESULTS: The positive rate of SNCG in colorectal cancer with and without liver metastasis was 68.1% and 27.9%, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant(P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that SNCG expression was an independent factor associated with the presence of liver metastasis(OR=8.29, 95%CI: 3.37-20.37, P<0.01). In synchronous colorectal liver metastasis, the median survival time of SNCG-negative and SNCG-positive was 12.6 months and 8.2 months, respectively(Log Rank, P<0.05). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that SNCG expression was an independent prognostic factor for colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastasis(RR=1.97, 95%CI:1.10-3.53, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: High expression of SNCG is present in the tumor tissue in patients with liver metastasis from colorectal cancer. SNCG may be used as a predictive biomarker for colorectal liver metastases and is an important prognostic factor in patients with liver metastasis from colorectal cancer.
