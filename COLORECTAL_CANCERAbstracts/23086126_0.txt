BACKGROUND: Hispanics are the largest and fastest growing ethnic group in the United States (US). AIMS: We evaluated the incidence and survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) among this population. METHODS: Data from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results program were used to calculate CRC age-adjusted and age-specific incidence rates in Hispanics during 1993-2007. Temporal trends in CRC incidence were examined using annual percent change (APC) and Poisson regression. The 1- and 5-year survival rates were calculated. RESULTS: The annual age-adjusted incidence rates for CRC in Hispanics of all ages declined from 47.4 per 100,000 in 1993-1997 to 43.8 per 100,000 in 2003-2007, with an APC during 1993-2007 equal to -0.8/year. However, there was a 45 % increase in CRC incidence among Hispanic men and women aged 20-49 years that affected both the right and left colon. The proportions of CRC cases with regional (+37 %) and distant (+18 %) spread increased, now constituting 72 % of cases diagnosed at that age. The Poisson model confirmed the increasing CRC incidence in Hispanics aged 20-49 years during 1993-2007 while adjusting for sex and geographic region. The 1-year survival improved in younger Hispanics from approximately 86 % in 1993-1997 to 91 % in 2003-2007 with no significant improvement in 5-year survival. In Hispanics aged >50 years, no significant improvements in survival were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of CRC in young Hispanic men and women has increased in the US. Most are diagnosed with regional or distant disease. No significant improvement in long-term survival was observed in young Hispanics with CRC.
