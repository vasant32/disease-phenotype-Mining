 AIM: According to the revised Bethesda Guidelines, colorectal cancer (CRC) occurring under age 50 years should be screened to exclude Lynch syndrome. However, in current practice in East Anglia, tumour screening is initiated only after genetics referral, reserved for those with a strong pedigree. This study aimed to determine how many patients with young-onset CRC undergo tumour screening in hospitals in East Anglia. METHOD: A retrospective case notes review over 5 years in four hospitals was undertaken to determine what proportion of those with young-onset CRC underwent referral for tumour screening and to assess local practices in terms of patient counselling and management. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-two patients were included. There was an average yearly caseload of 6-9 patients per hospital. Documented family history was rare, as was counselling concerning metachronous and extra-colonic tumour risk and CRC risk in relatives. The rate of referral for genetic testing varied from 44% to 65%. Postoperative colonoscopic surveillance was inconsistent. CONCLUSION: Many patients with young-onset CRC are managed as sporadic cancers, without Lynch syndrome having been excluded. This may have implications for survival of patients and any affected relatives. A streamlined management algorithm for tumour screening and genetics referral is recommended.
