In the last few decades there have been significant changes in the approach to rectal cancer management. A multimodality approach and advanced surgical techniques have led to an expansion of the treatment of metastatic disease, with improved survival. Hepatic metastases are present at one point or another in about 50% of patients with colorectal cancer, with surgical resection being the only chance for cure. As the use of multimodality treatment has allowed the tackling of more complicated cases, one of the main questions that remain unanswered is the management of patients with synchronous rectal cancer and hepatic metastatic lesions. The question is one of priority, with all possible options being explored. Specifically, these include the simultaneous rectal cancer and hepatic metastases resection, the rectal cancer followed by chemotherapy and then by the liver resection, and finally the "liver-first" option. This paper will review the three treatment options and attempt to dissect the indications for each. In addition, the role of laparoscopy in the synchronous resection of rectal cancer and hepatic metastases will be reviewed in order to identify future trends.
