Surgical resection of liver metastases of colorectal cancer can improve clinical outcome and even cure some patients with metastatic disease. For patients with unresectable liver metastases, the ultimate treatment goal is to let them become eligible for resection. In recent years, considerable attention has been paid to molecular targeted therapies to improve the efficacy of the available chemotherapeutic regimens in order to increase the downsizing rate of liver metastases and increase resectability. This overview will focus on the oncological management and chemotherapeutic options of patients with unresectable liver metastases.
