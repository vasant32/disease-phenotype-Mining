In Hungary, mortality rates from colorectal cancer are dramatically high, therefore the reduction by population screening as a public health measure is considered as one of the priorities of National Public Health Program. In the beginning, a human-specific immunological test was applied in the "model programs", as a screening tool, to detect the occult blood in the stool; compliance was 32% in average. However, the objectives of the model programs have not been achieved, because, among other reasons, a debate on the method of choice and the strategy to follow have divided the professional public opinion. In this study the debated issues are critically discussed, being convinced that, at present, population screening seems to be the most promising way to alleviate the burden of colorectal cancer.
