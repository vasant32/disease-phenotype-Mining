Emerging evidence has demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors to participate in cancer development. In this study, we found that miR-429 expression was up-regulated in human colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues, and the high miR-429 expression was significantly associated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. Functionally, miR-429 overexpression suppressed cell apoptosis by directly targeting SOX2 in HT-29 cells. Taken together, our data suggest for the first time that miR-429 could play an oncogenic role in the cellular processes of CRC and represent a novel prognostic biomarker for CRC.
