The VELOUR and VITAL studies recently demonstrated ziv-aflibercept improved overall survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), including those previously treated with bevacizumab, but did not improve overall survival in non-small-cell lung cancer. Thus, VEGF-directed agents might be useful throughout the continuum of care in mCRC, but biomarkers are needed to identify patients likely to benefit.
