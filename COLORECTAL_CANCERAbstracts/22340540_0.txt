 BACKGROUND: The continual and rapid development of techniques which are used for diagnosis and treatment makes management of colorectal cancer more difficult depending on single discipline. Colorectal cancer multidisciplinary team (MDT) working model is recommended by UK and other countries, but there is little information on the impact of MDT working on management of colorectal cancer in China. The aim of this study was to assess the effect on management of colorectal cancer after the inception of an MDT. METHODS: A total of 595 consecutive colorectal cancer patients were referred to the Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, the pre-MDT cohort include 297 patients, recruited from January 1999 to November 2002, and the MDT cohort had 298 patients enrolled from December 2002 to September 2006. Information recorded included: TNM stage from histological reports, degree of differentiation, the number of examined lymph nodes and CT TNM staging performed or not, and its accuracy, including local and distant recurrence. RESULTS: The number of examined lymph nodes and the accuracy of TNM staging by CT in the MDT group were significantly more than those in pre-MDT group. CT TNM staging was more accurate in the MDT group compared to the pre-MDT group (P = 0.044). The rate of tumor recurrence in the MDT group was lower than pre-MDT group (log-rank test, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that age (P = 0.001), management after inception of the MDT (P = 0.002), degree of differentiation (P = 0.003), number of examined lymph nodes (P = 0.002), and TNM stage (P = 0.000) were important factors that independently influence overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: The inception of MDT working improved the diagnostic accuracy and overall survival of colorectal cancer patients. MDT working promoted communication and cooperation between disciplines and ensured high-quality diagnosis, evidence-based decision making, and optimal treatment planning.
