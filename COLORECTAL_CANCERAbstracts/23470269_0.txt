 BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) associated with Lynch syndrome usually presents at a relatively young age. The Revised Bethesda Guidelines advise screening for Lynch syndrome in patients diagnosed with CRC and a positive family history (FH) of CRC and other Lynch-related cancers. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate recording of the FH and identify factors associated with recording in young patients with CRC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In one academic and two nonacademic hospitals, of all patients diagnosed with CRC at the age of 60 years or younger between 1999 and 2007, electronic medical records were evaluated for a recorded FH of CRC and other Lynch-related cancers. Patient and tumor characteristics were retrieved from the Dutch Comprehensive Cancer Centre and the Dutch Pathological Archive. RESULTS: A total of 676 patients were identified. FH was recorded in 395/676 (58%) patients. From 1999 to 2007, recording improved with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.10 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-1.17] per year. Stage III CRC (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.07-2.75) and administration of chemotherapy (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.17-2.89) were associated with recording in multivariate analysis. Other factors, including age at diagnosis, sex, surgery, radiotherapy, proximal tumor localization, poor differentiation, and mucinous histology, were not associated with recording. CONCLUSION: A FH of CRC and other Lynch-related cancers was not recorded in âˆ¼40% of young CRC patients and recording improved only slightly over the years. As a first step in the identification of Lynch-related cancer families, physicians should be trained to record a detailed FH in the work-up of all newly diagnosed CRC patients.
