 OBJECTIVE: To investigate a possible association between the preoperative concentration of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor (sVEGF), perioperative blood transfusion, and survival in patients operated on for colorectal cancer. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: University hospital, Denmark. SUBJECTS: 614 patients operated on for primary colorectal cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Association between preoperative blood transfusion and preoperative concentration of sVEGF. Association between perioperative blood transfusion and survival. RESULTS: Blood transfused up to one month before preoperative serum samples were obtained was significantly (p = 0.02) associated with high preoperative concentrations of sVEGF. The frequency of perioperative blood transfusion was significantly (p = 0.0007) higher in patients with rectal cancer than in patients with colon cancer. A multivariate analysis showed that intraoperative or postoperative blood transfusion or both, were significantly (p = 0.03) associated with poor survival in patients with Dukes stage A, B and C rectal cancers, while this association was not found in patients with colon cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative blood transfusion may be associated with high preoperative concentrations of sVEGF in patients with colorectal cancer. Transfusion during or after the operation is associated with poor survival in patients with Dukes stage A, B, and C rectal cancers.
