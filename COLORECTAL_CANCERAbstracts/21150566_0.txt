 OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to evaluate the use of fecal hemoglobin-haptoglobin (Hb-Hp) complex, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and secretory IgA as potential diagnostic markers for the screening of colorectal cancer. METHODS: Our study consisted of 190 participants (150 patients and 40 healthy individuals) aged 40 to 70 years who underwent complete colonoscopy. From each participant, a stool sample was collected 1 day before colonoscopy. The patients were instructed to collect another sample after the fourteenth postoperative day. No special diet was recommended. RESULTS: In the control group, all fecal markers were within normal values in most participants. Colorectal tumors were accompanied by a highly significant increase in all markers. The median value of Hb-Hp complex was 23.22±10.02 (P<0.0001) whereas the median values of MPO and sIgA were 14936.43±9580.83 (P<0.0001) and 6503.38±2794.87 (P<0.0001), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of Hb-Hp complex, MPO, and sIgA are 95.3% and 87.5%, 96% and 87%, and 90.8% and 85%, respectively. The difference of preoperative and postoperative values of the patients was statistically significant for all markers. After surgical intervention, the value of Hb-Hp complex was normalized in 133 of the 150 patients (88.7%). The postoperative values of MPO were within normal limits in 131 patients (87.3%), whereas those of secretory IgA were within normal limits in 103 of the 150 patients (68.5%). CONCLUSION: Fecal Hb-Hp complex, MPO, and sIgA can effectively be used as screening tools for the early diagnosis of colorectal cancer, and for the postoperative follow-up of patients.
