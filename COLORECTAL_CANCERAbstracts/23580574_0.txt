Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is best known for its crucial role in colorectal cancer suppression. Rodent models with various Apc mutations have enabled experimental validation of different Apc functions in tumors and normal tissues. Since the development of the first mouse model with a germline Apc mutation in the early 1990s, 20 other Apc mouse and rat models have been generated. This article compares and contrasts currently available Apc rodent models with particular emphasis on providing potential explanations for their reported variation in three areas: (i) intestinal polyp multiplicity, (ii) intestinal polyp distribution, and (iii) extraintestinal phenotypes.
