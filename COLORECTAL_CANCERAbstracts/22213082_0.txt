 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstricting peptide, plays an important role in carcinogenesis. Previous in vitro studies have shown that colorectal cancer cells produce ET-1. METHODS: ET-1 and its receptors ET-A (ET(A) R) and ET-B (ET(B) R) were analyzed in colorectal cancer cell lines and tumors by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Also, ET-1 levels were measured by ELISA in blood samples collected before and after tumor resection. RESULTS: ET-1 was immunohistochemically expressed by tumor cells at a variable level in 39 cases tested. The adjacent normal mucosa was negative for ET-1 expression. Strong ET(A) R expression observed in the deeper infiltrating areas at the periphery of neoplastic tissue correlated significantly with tumor stage. ET(B) R levels were very low or undetectable. Western blot analysis in paired (normal, tumor) fresh-frozen samples of colorectal cancers and in four colon carcinoma cell lines confirmed these findings. In addition, lower levels of ET-1 in the peripheral circulation after the tumor resection were found by ELISA as compared to those observed before surgery. CONCLUSIONS: ET-1 and ET(A) R, but not ET(B) R, are expressed at a higher level in primary and cultured colon carcinoma cells as compared to normal colon mucosa cells. Further functional studies are needed to explore the role of ET-1/ET(A) R axis in colon carcinogenesis.
