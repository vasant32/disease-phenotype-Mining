Chronic inflammation is a well-recognized risk factor for development of human cancer in several tissues, including large bowel. Inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, is a longstanding inflammatory disease of intestine with increased risk for colorectal cancer development. Several molecular events involved in chronic inflammatory process may contribute to multistep carcinogenesis of human colorectal cancer in the inflamed colon. They include overproduction of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, overproduction and upregulation of productions and enzymes of arachidonic acid biosynthesis pathway and cytokines, and intestinal immune system dysfunction. In this paper, I will describe several methods to induce colorectal neoplasm in the inflamed colon. First, I will introduce a protocol of a novel inflammation-associated colon carcinogenesis in mice. In addition, powerful tumor-promotion/progression activity of dextran sodium sulfate in the large bowel of Apc(Min/+) mice will be described. Finally, chemoprevention of inflammation-associated colon carcinogenesis will be mentioned.
