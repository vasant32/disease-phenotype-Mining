 BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic salvage surgery for colorectal cancer is a novel but technically challenging option for surgeons. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic surgery in patients with recurrent or metachronous colorectal cancer in comparison with an open approach. METHODS: The data used in this study were obtained from databases, the data of which were collected prospectively from January 1996 to February 2010. Data pertaining to patients, operations, and short-term outcomes were analyzed and compared between open and laparoscopic salvage groups. RESULTS: Among the 3,425 patients studied, colorectal cancer recurred in 565 patients (16.5%) and 41 patients had colorectal salvage operations. Twenty-six patients with recurrence underwent open surgery and 15 cases underwent laparoscopic surgery. The short-term outcomes of the laparoscopic group were comparable with those of the open surgery group or were partly favorable. The five-year disease-free interval and overall survival of recurrent cancer patients were not significantly different from those of the open patients. Metachronous colorectal cancer occurred in 13 patients (0.38%), 5 of whom had open surgery and 6 had laparoscopic salvage. The only significant difference between the groups was a shorter operating time for the laparoscopic group. Late in the study, four patients in the laparoscopic recurrent group and one patient in the metachronous group were converted to open surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic surgery yielded short-term outcomes that were comparable to those of conventional open surgery, in both recurrent and metachronous colorectal cancer patients. Thus, minimally invasive salvage approaches should be considered as a treatment option for the recurrent and the metachronous colorectal cancer patient.
