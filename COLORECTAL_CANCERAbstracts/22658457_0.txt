 BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab prolongs OS when added to first- or second-line chemotherapy for mCRC. This retrospective analysis evaluated the association between the continued use of BBP and survival outcomes in mCRC patients treated in a community oncology setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were derived from the US Oncology iKnowMed electronic medical record system. Patients with mCRC who received first-line bevacizumab-containing therapy between July 1, 2006 and June 30, 2009, were dichotomized into 2 second-line treatment cohorts: those receiving BBP and No-BBP. Clinical outcomes, including OS and postprogression OS (ppOS; time from start of second-line therapy to any-cause death), were calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the effects of patient and treatment characteristics on survival outcomes, adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Overall, 573 patients met the inclusion criteria for analysis-BBP (n = 267) and No-BBP (n = 306). Median OS and ppOS were longer in the BBP cohort (27.9 and 14.6 months, respectively) compared with the No-BBP cohort (21.4 and 10.1 months). According to multivariate analyses, BBP was associated with longer OS (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61-0.95) and ppOS (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60-0.93) after adjusting for potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS: In the community oncology setting, BBP treatment was correlated with prolonged OS and ppOS in patients with mCRC. These results provide insight into real-world patterns of care and resultant bevacizumab use in this patient population.
