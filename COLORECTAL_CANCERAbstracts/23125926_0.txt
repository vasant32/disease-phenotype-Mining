The early results (e.g., patient survival) of RFA for the treatment of patients with NSCLC and pulmonary metastasis from various primary lesions including colorectal cancer, lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and sarcoma appear encouraging and suggest the potential to offer long-term survival for the patients with oligorecurrence or oligometastasis of lung cancer. The usefulness of RFA for oligorecurrence or oligometastasis of lung cancer should be clarified by prospective studies in the future.
