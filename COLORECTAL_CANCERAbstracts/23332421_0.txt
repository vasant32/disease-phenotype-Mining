BACKGROUND: 5-Fluorouracil- or oxaliplatin-based regimens are the treatments of choice in patients with PC from colon cancer. There are currently no useful preclinical evaluations to guide the decision-making process for tailored therapy. The aim of the present study was to compare the advantages and limits of a conventional in vitro chemosensitivity test with those of a panel of biomolecular markers in predicting clinical response to different drugs used to treat colon cancer-derived PC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fresh surgical biopsy specimens were obtained from 28 patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis from colon cancer. TS, TP, DPD, MDR1, MRP-1, MGMT, BRCA1, ERCC1, GSTP1, and XPD gene expression levels were determined by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. An in vitro chemosensitivity test was used to define a sensitivity or resistance profile to the drugs used to treat each patient. RESULTS: Expression levels of the genes analyzed were generally poorly related to each other. TS and ERCC1 expression was inversely related to response to 5-FU-and/or oxaliplatin-containing regimens. Significant predictivity in terms of sensitivity but poor predictivity of resistance (56.2%) (P = .037) were observed for ERCC1 expression (90%), and high predictivity of resistance (100%) but very low predictivity of sensitivity (40%) (P = .014) were registered for TS. The best overall and significant predictivity was observed for chemosensitivity test results (62.5% sensitivity and 89% resistance; P = .005). CONCLUSIONS: Sensitivity and resistance to drugs used in vivo was better defined by the chemosensitivity test than by biomarker expression.
