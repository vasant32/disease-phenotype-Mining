Liver resections by metastatic colorectal cancer are considered to be seldom applicable on the reason of bilobar lesions and insufficient volume of the left liver lobe. The two-stage operations have been suggested for such situations. Of 276 patients, treated in our centre, 52 cases, unsuitable for the single-stage liver resection according to the preoperative data, had been retrospectively chosen. All these patients had the procedure of the right branch of vena porta occlusion, which aimed the compensatory hypertrophy of the left liver lobe. The efficacy of the occlusion was up to 73%. The median left lobe enlargement was 11%. The increase of the summary diameter of metastases was 60,4% (from 53 mm to 85 mm; p < 0,0001). The follow-up time was from 3 to 96 months. The three-year survival time was significantly higher in patients with the completed two-stage surgical treatment in comparison with those, who were refused the liver resection--77 and 43%, respectively. The multifactorial analysis revealed the only independent factor of the survival time--the extrahepatic intraabdominal lesion (p = 0,014).
