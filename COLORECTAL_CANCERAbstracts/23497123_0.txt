 BACKGROUND: In order to analyze postoperative liver regeneration following hepatic resection after chemotherapy, we retrospectively investigated the differences in liver regeneration by comparing changes of residual liver volume in three groups: a living liver donor group and two groups of patients with colorectal liver metastases who did and did not undergo preoperative chemotherapy. METHODS: This study included 32 patients who had at least segmental anatomical hepatic resection. Residual liver volume, early postoperative liver volume, and late postoperative liver volume were calculated to study the changes over time. From the histopathological analysis of chemotherapy-induced liver disorders, the effect on liver regeneration according to the histopathology of noncancerous liver tissue was also compared between the two colorectal cancer groups using Kleiner's score for steatohepatitis grading {Hepatology, 41(6):1313-1321, 2005} and sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) grading for sinusoidal obstructions {Ann Oncol, 15(3):460-466, 2004}. RESULTS: Assuming a preoperative liver volume of 100%, mean late postoperative liver volumes in the three groups (the living liver donor group and the colorectal cancer groups with or without chemotherapy) were 91.1%, 80.8%, and 81.3%, respectively, with about the same rate of liver regeneration among the three groups. Histopathological analysis revealed no correlation between either the Kleiner's scores or the SOS grading and liver regeneration. CONCLUSIONS: As estimated by liver volume, the level of liver regeneration was the same in normal livers, tumor-bearing livers, and post-chemotherapy tumor-bearing livers. Liver regeneration was not adversely affected by the extent to which steatosis or sinusoidal dilatation was induced in noncancerous tissue by chemotherapy in patients scheduled for surgery.
