Ulcerative colitis (UC) patients have an increased risk of colorectal cancer. UC has two general patterns of dysplasia, which are commonly classified as adenoma-like dysplasia-associated lesion or mass (DALM) and non-adenoma-like DALM. The latter has a high risk of concurrent malignancy and often requires a colectomy. Unfortunately, non-adenoma-like DALMs sometimes have endoscopic features similar to those of adenoma-like DALMs. Therefore, new endoscopic techniques to distinguish between these two kinds of DALM have been proposed.
