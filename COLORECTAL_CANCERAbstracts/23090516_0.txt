 OBJECTIVE: Women with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) have a 40-60% lifetime risk for endometrial cancer. Guidelines in Denmark recommend gynecologic screening for female members of families with HNPCC. We estimated the knowledge of endometrial cancer risk and identified possible predictors of compliance with the screening among women from families with HNPCC. METHODS: A questionnaire exploring the knowledge of endometrial cancer risk and compliance with screening was sent to 707 women from families with HNPCC who had been recommended endometrial cancer surveillance. The response rate after one reminder was 86% (606 of 707). Data were analyzed by simple and multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: Four hundred seventy-one women were included in the final analyses; 65% reported being aware of the increased risk of endometrial cancer. The awareness was significantly greater among women with high educational level (81%; P<.001), women who had received genetic counseling (75%; P<.001), women with family history of gynecologic cancer (76%; P<.001), and those with high perceived endometrial cancer risk (77%; P<.001). Overall, 67% had participated in gynecologic screening. No significant differences were found in compliance regarding women's educational level or their family risk classification. Analyses of data in a multivariable logistic regression model showed that knowledge of endometrial cancer risk was the most important predictor for positive compliance with the gynecologic screening (odds ratio 4.86, 95% confidence interval 3.05-7.74). CONCLUSION: Women's awareness of endometrial cancer risk is the most important predictor of their compliance with gynecologic screening in families with HNPCC. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.
