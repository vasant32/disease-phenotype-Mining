E-cadherin, encoded by the CDH1 gene, involves in invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. CDH1 -C160A polymorphism was shown to contribute to genetic susceptibility to colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the results from different studies remain controversial. This study was conducted to further explore the association between CDH1 -C160A genetic polymorphism and CRC susceptibility by means of a meta-analysis. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify all case-control studies of CDH1 -C160A polymorphism and risk for CRC. A total of nine eligible studies, including 7954 CRC cases and 7369 controls, were identified to the meta-analysis. On the whole, the meta-analysis indicated that CDH1 -C160A genetic polymorphism could reduce the risk of CRC under AA versus CC contrast (odds ratio [OR]=0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.75-0.98, p(heterogeneity)=0.11), recessive model (OR=0.88, 95% CI=0.77-0.99, p(heterogeneity)=0.23), dominant model (OR=0.92, 95% CI=0.87-0.99, p(heterogeneity)=0.11), and allele A versus allele C contrast (OR=0.93, 95% CI=0.88-0.98, p(heterogeneity)=0.26). A conclusion could be drawn from the research that CDH1 -C160A polymorphism provides a possible protection against CRC, which is especially evident in Caucasian and hospital populations.
