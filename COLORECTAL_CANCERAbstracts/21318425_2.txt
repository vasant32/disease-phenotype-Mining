 BACKGROUND: There is wide variation in the incidence of colorectal cancer globally and also within the same country among different racial or ethnic groups. The present population-based study was undertaken to determine the incidence of colorectal cancer in Kashmiri population which is non-migratory and ethnically homogeneous having stable food habits. METHODS: Over a period of one year, all newly diagnosed and histological proved cases of colorectal cancer in all possible areas, where such patients are diagnosed and treated were prospectively registered. RESULTS: A total of 212 cases of colorectal cancers were registered; of them 113 (53.3%) originated in the colon and other 99 (46.7%) in rectum. Male to female ratio was 1.2:1. The crude incidence rate of colorectal cancer was 3.65/100,000; it was 3.78 in males, and 3.50/100,000 in females. The incidence rates for colorectal cancer in Muslims and Hindus were different. The crude incidence rate for colorectal carcinoma was highest for district Srinagar 6.19/100,000 (urban area) and lowest for district Kupwara (rural area) 1.59/100,000. The highest numbers of cases were detected in the age group 55-59 years (n = 34). The age-specific rate for colorectal carcinoma was highest in the age group 55-59 years (17.21/100,000), followed by 65-69 years (14.86/100,000). The age standardized incidence rate was 4.52/100,000 per year. The truncated age adjusted incidence rates in age group 35-64 years was 8.31/100,000; while that for colorectal carcinoma was 8.77/100,000 in males and 7.66/100,000 in females. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the incidence of colorectal cancer in Kashmir valley is similar to that reported in the rest of India.
