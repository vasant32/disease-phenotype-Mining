Epidemiological and experimental evidence indicates chronic inflammation as a risk factor for colorectal cancer. We investigated whether IL-1B -511C>T (rs16944), IL-1B +3954C>T (rs1143634) and IL1-RN +2018T>C (rs419598) cytokine polymorphisms are correlated with colorectal cancer. Blood samples were obtained from 377 Romanian subjects: 144 patients with sporadic colorectal cancer and 233 healthy controls. Polymorphisms were analyzed by allelic discrimination TaqMan PCR assays with specific probes. The results of our study showed that IL-1RN +2018T>C polymorphism is associated with colorectal cancer. We found that there was a significant difference in the frequency of CC genotype between patients with colorectal cancer and the control group (OR 2.42, 95 % CI: 1.06-5.53, p = 0,034) when TT genotype was used as reference. Furthermore, in a stratified analysis, a positive association was found only for IL-1RN +2018CC genotype, that was limited to early I and II stages (OR 2.72, 95 % CI: 1.05-7.03, p = 0,033). We did not find any association between any of the IL-1B polymorphisms and colorectal cancer. In conclusion this study found that IL-1RN +2018T>C polymorphism is associated with colorectal cancer, mainly for localized disease.
