Galectin-1 (gal-1) is an important molecule secreted by many tumors, which induces apoptosis in activated T-cells and promotes tumor angiogenesis, both of which phenomena facilitate successful establishment of tumor in the body. However, little is known about the function of intracellular gal-1 or its transcriptional regulation in colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we demonstrate that gal-1 expression is epigenetically regulated in CRC through promoter hypermethylation. Intracellular gal-1 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in CRC cells with concomitant down-regulation of Wnt and NF-ÎºB signaling pathways. Together, these data suggested that gal-1 silencing imparts CRC with the ability to proliferate and escape apoptosis.
