BACKGROUND:                  Liver is one of the commonest sites of metastasis in colorectal cancer patients. Solitary liver metastasis or oligometastasis are traditionally treated by surgical resection or chemotherapy.                                DISCUSSION:                  There may be a subgroup of these patients who are not suitable for surgery or chemotherapy due to various co-morbid factors. These patients can be treated by novel minimally invasive or noninvasive ablative techniques like interstitial brachytherapy, extracranial stereotactic radiotherapy, and radiofrequency ablation.
