 PURPOSE: Recently, some studies have shown that diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome increase the risk of colorectal neoplasms. Although the mechanism is not known, those have been proposed to contribute to this phenomenon, including insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and adipokine production. The objective of this study was to assess the association between metabolic risk factors and colorectal neoplasm. METHODS: Study participants visited the National Cancer Center, Korea, for screening (2007-2009). A total of 1,771 diagnosed adenoma patients and 4,667 polyp-free controls were included. The association between risk factors and colorectal neoplasm was evaluated using logistic regression models. RESULTS: High waist circumference, blood pressure, and serum triglyceride levels were associated with an increased risk of colorectal adenoma. Metabolic syndrome (MS) was associated with an increased risk of adenoma (OR = 1.44, 95 % CI = 1.23-1.70). The association between MS and colorectal adenoma was observed regardless of advanced/low-risk adenoma, and multiplicity. MS affected right colon adenomas (OR = 1.50, 95 % CI = 1.22-1.85), left colon adenomas (OR = 1.36, 95 % CI = 1.05-1.76), and adenomas in multiple anatomical locations (OR = 1.59, 95 % CI = 1.19-2.12), but was not associated with rectum. CONCLUSION: Central obesity, triglyceride level, and MS are risk factors for colorectal adenoma including advanced adenoma and multiplicity.
