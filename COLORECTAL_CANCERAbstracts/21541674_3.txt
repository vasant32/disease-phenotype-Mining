Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer related death in developed countries. One of the reasons is the absence of tumor specific diagnostic and prognostic markers. The aim of this study was to examine the correlation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and -9 (MMP-9) expressions in serum and clinicopathological features of the colorectal adenocarcinoma. Another aim was to examine expression of MMP-9 in the tissue of the colorectal carcinoma in MMP-9 serum positive patients. In addition, we tried to establish the correlation between preoperative levels of serum markers (CEA and CA 19-9) and presence of MMP-2 or MMP-9. The study was performed on 32 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma who underwent surgery and 11 patients in a control group who were operated for benign diseases. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to determine the molecular mass and SDS-PAGE zymography to determine levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Expression of MMP-9 was determined immunohistochemically in the tissue of the colorectal carcinoma of MMP-9 serum positive patients. MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels were increased in the serum of the patients with colorectal cancer compared to the control group. There was significant correlation in MMPs levels among the patients with tumor stage I and II and the patients with tumor stage III and IV. Obtained results did not demonstrate correlation between levels of CEA, CA 19-9 and presence of MMP-2 or MMP-9. MMP-9 expression was positive in 85% of MMP-9 serum positive patients with colorectal carcinoma. The overexpression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 strongly suggests its association with colorectal adenocarcinoma. Detection of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in serum might be useful for identification of patients with higher risk for colorectal cancer recurrence.
