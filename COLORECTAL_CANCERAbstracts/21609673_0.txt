The setting up and the progression of the colorectal cancer (CCR) follow a sequence of events that are spatio-temporally rigorously orchestrated. The failures that specifically target the signaling pathways responsible for the cancerization of the colorectal mucosa have been well described and among these it seems that a dysregulation of the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway is involved in the triggering of near 90 % of the cases. It has been also described that several risk factors linked to metabolic disorders (feeding, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, etc.) predispose individuals to CCR but no rational explanations were given. We propose that, since it is implicated in the control of the insulin pathway among other actions, the nutritional sensor O-GlcNAcylation may be the element linking these metabolic disorders to CCR.
