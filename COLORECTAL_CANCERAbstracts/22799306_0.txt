 BACKGROUND: Previous studies concerning the association between methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism and colorectal cancer risk in Asian populations generated conflicting results. A meta-analysis was therefore performed to allow a more reliable estimate of any link. METHODS: Relevant studies concerning the association between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and risk of colorectal cancer were included into this meta-analysis. The quality of the studies was assessed according to a predefined scale. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined for this gene-disease association using fixed or random effect models according to the heterogeneity between included studies. RESULTS: Finally, 21 studies with a total of 6692 cases and 8266 controls were included. Meta-analyses showed that there was an obvious association of the MTHFR 677T allele with decreased risk of colorectal cancer (OR = 0.91, 95%CI=0.85-0.98, P=0.011). Subgroup analyses by country further identified this association, with dietary folate as the main source of heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: The MTHFR 677T allele is associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer in Asian populations, and there is effect modification by population plasma folate.
