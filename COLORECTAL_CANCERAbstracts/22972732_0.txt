 OBJECTIVE: To describe cancer screening rates for cancer survivors and compare them with those for matched controls. DESIGN: Population-based, retrospective study with individuals linked across administrative databases. SETTING: Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: Survivors of breast (n = 11 219), colorectal (n = 4348), or endometrial (n = 3473) cancer, or Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) (n = 2071) matched to general population controls. Survivors were those who had completed primary treatment and were on "well" follow-up. The study period was 4 years (1 to 5 years from the date of cancer diagnosis). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Never versus ever screened (in the 4-year study period) for breast cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC), and cervical cancer and never versus ever received (during the study period) a periodic health examination; rates were compared between cancer survivors and controls. Random effects models were used to estimate odds ratios and 95% CIs. RESULTS: Sixty-five percent of breast cancer survivors were never screened for CRC and 40% were never screened for cervical cancer. Approximately 50% of CRC survivors were never screened for breast or cervical cancer. Thirty-two percent of endometrial cancer survivors were never screened for breast cancer and 66% were never screened for CRC. Forty-four percent of HL survivors were never screened for breast cancer, 77% were never screened for CRC, and 32% were never screened for cervical cancer. Comparison with matched controls showed a mixed picture, with breast and endometrial cancer survivors more likely, and CRC and HL survivors less likely, than controls to be screened. CONCLUSION: There is concern about the preventive care of cancer survivors despite frequent visits to both oncology specialists and family physicians during the "well" follow-up period.
