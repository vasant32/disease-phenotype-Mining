BACKGROUND & AIMS: Liver X receptors (LXR) are transcriptional regulators of cholesterol metabolism, controlling cholesterol flow into cells, catabolism, and efflux. Cholesterol controls cell proliferation; disruptions in cholesterol metabolism have been associated with development of colon cancer. We investigated whether expression of activated LXR protects against intestinal tumorigenesis in mice. METHODS: We analyzed development of colon cancer in mice that express a constitutive active form of LXRa only in the intestinal epithelium, under the control of villin promoter (iVP16LXRa). These mice were crossed with Apc (min/+) mice, or given azoxymethane followed by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), to assess intestinal tumor formation. We also assessed proliferation and apoptosis of a human colorectal cancer cell line (HT29) transfected with an adenoviral vector that expressed Ad VP16hLXRa, compared with cells expressing AdVP16 (control), and their ability to form xenograft tumors in mice. HT29 cells were also incubated with the LXR ligand GW3965. RESULTS: In human colorectal cancer cells, ligand-induced activation of LXR or transfection with Ad VP16hLXRa blocked G1 phase, increased caspase-dependent apoptosis, and slowed growth of xenograft tumors in mice. iVP16LXRa mice formed fewer, smaller tumors than VP16 (control) mice following administration of azoxymethane and DSS. APC (min/+)/iVP16LXRa mice also developed fewer, smaller intestinal tumors than APCmin/+/iVP16 mice. Gene expression analysis indicated that activation of LXRa affected lipid metabolic networks and increased cholesterol efflux in the intestine. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of activated LXRa blocks proliferation of human colorectal cancer cells and slows growth of xenograft tumors in mice. It also reduces intestinal tumor formation following administration of chemical carcinogens, and in Apc (min/+) mice. LXR agonists might therefore be developed as therapeutics for colorectal cancer.
