 PURPOSE: Although the regional lymph node status is essential for staging of colorectal cancer, the importance of the total number of collected nodes remains controversial. Our aim was to examine the impact of the metastatic lymph node ratio (LNR) on the survival of patients with Dukes C colorectal cancer. METHODS: All patients with Dukes C histology were selected from a prospectively collected database of all colorectal cancers resected between 1997 and 2007 at our institution. Demographic, histopathological and adjuvant treatment data were collected. The total number of positive lymph nodes was divided by the total number of lymph nodes examined to calculate the LNR. Patients were categorised into LNR groups 1 to 5 according to cut-off points: ≤0.1, 0.21, 0.36, 0.6 and ≥0.61. Survival from the date of operation was calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify those factors influencing survival. RESULTS: Of 1,098 patients who underwent colorectal cancer resections, 41% were staged as Dukes C. Sixty-four percent of patients received chemotherapy. The median number of lymph nodes harvested and positive for tumour were 11 (range 1-52) and 4 (range 1-28), respectively. In patients who received chemotherapy, 5-year survival was 69.3% for LNR 1 and 23.6% for LNR 5. When no chemotherapy was given, the 5-year survival was 43.1% for LNR 1 and 8.7% for LNR 5. CONCLUSIONS: Current evaluation of positive lymph nodes may not accurately stage Dukes C colorectal cancer. The assessment of the LNR is a useful prognostic method in this heterogenous group of patients.
