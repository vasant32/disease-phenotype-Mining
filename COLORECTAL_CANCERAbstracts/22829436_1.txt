 BACKGROUND: Intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) is considered the standard for the identification of liver metastases. Use of lipid-stabilized perfluorobutane microbubbles as an ultrasound contrast agent may improve this. The value of contrast-enhanced IOUS (CE-IOUS) in enumerating colorectal liver metastases was studied here. METHODS: CE-IOUS was performed in consecutive resections for colorectal liver metastases in 2007-2010. All patients underwent preoperative computed tomography. Magnetic resonance imaging was not carried out routinely. Conventional intraoperative examination including IOUS, and CE-IOUS with peripherally injected contrast were performed. The histopathological findings and 6-month follow-up images were used as the reference standard. RESULTS: The study group of 102 patients had a total of 315 lesions identified on preoperative imaging (2·4 lesions per operation; 129 operations). Conventional intraoperative examination including IOUS identified 350 lesions (2·7 per operation). CE-IOUS identified 370 lesions (2·9 per operation). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of CE-IOUS were 97·1, 59·1 and 93·2 per cent respectively. The CE-IOUS findings altered the surgical plan in 19 operations (14·7 per cent). CONCLUSION: CE-IOUS provided additional information to that obtained using contemporary preoperative imaging and conventional intraoperative examinations.
