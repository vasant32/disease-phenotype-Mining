 BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to compare the direct costs of laparoscopic surgery (LS) and open surgery (OS) in the treatment of mid or low rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients in Korea. METHODS AND RESULTS: The records of 130 LS patients and 125 OS patients were reviewed. Hospital stay after surgery and overall complication rates within three months of surgery were not significantly different. The LS group had significantly higher median costs than the OS group ($7,467.30 vs. $5,667.00; P < 0.001). The median hospital costs during hospitalization for surgery were higher in the LS group ($7,436.60 vs. $5,626.60; P < 0.001), but hospital costs for management of early postoperative complications were similar. The higher direct costs of LS were mainly due to the more expensive consumables and equipment needed for LS. CONCLUSIONS: Further study is needed to determine whether the higher direct costs of LS for rectal cancer are balanced by advantages of LS over OS, such as better short-term outcomes and cosmetic effect.
