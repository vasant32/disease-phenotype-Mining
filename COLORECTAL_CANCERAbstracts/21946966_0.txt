 AIM: To explore the views of GPs and specialists on colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. METHODS: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews of 15 GPs and 11 specialists investigating views on the proposed introduction of CRC screening in New Zealand. RESULTS: Both GPs and specialists in this study, whilst agreeing on the overall merit of a population screening programme for CRC in New Zealand, argued that there were not sufficient resources to warrant the implementation of such a programme. There was also little support, especially by the GPs, for the faecal occult blood test, which is likely to be the screening test if implemented. CONCLUSIONS: The concerns of GPs and specialists need to be addressed if a screening programme for CRC is introduced in New Zealand. GPs undoubtedly would have to be the advocates of this programme to their patients and therefore they will have to be convinced of the value of this exercise.
