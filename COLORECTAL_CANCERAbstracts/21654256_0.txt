 BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is a major cause of mortality. This gives high public health priority to mass screening using a noninvasive, fecal occult blood test of asymptomatic individuals. A positive test selects those who should undergo colonoscopy to ensure early detection of colorectal cancer. Guaiac fecal occult blood test has low sensitivity. Automated immunochemical tests that measure the fecal human hemoglobin concentration are more sensitive and can be simplified as a 1- to 3-sample format with optimum cutoff points. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to improve the sensitivity of the test by choosing an accurate format (1- to 3-sample and optimum hemoglobin concentration) while maintaining acceptable specificity and avoiding alteration of the screening program in terms of quality of life and economic outputs. METHODS: We used a Markov model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a screening program for a population of 100,000 asymptomatic individuals by use of immunological fecal tests with different cutoffs, leading to different sensitivity/specificity ratios, and to compare its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio compared with the guaiac fecal test program. RESULTS: The results suggest that a 3-sample immunological test with 50 ng/mL as a positive cutoff is cost-effective. It provides more asymptomatic cancer detection without significantly increasing normal colonoscopies. CONCLUSION: This format should be prospectively evaluated in mass screening.
