INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer is a major public health problem. However, this cancer is usually developed on preexisting lesion. This makes this cancer accessible to a prevention strategy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the clinicopathologic characteristics of patients under 50 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study involved 133 patients with colorectal cancer recruited in CHU Ibn-Rochd, Casablanca. Data relating age, sex, stage at presentation, histological type and tumor location were obtained from the pathological and clinical records of each patient. Statistical analysis was performed to compare clinicopathological data in patients under 50 years and in older patients. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The average age of patients was 54 years. The frequency of patients aged 50 or under was 40.6% The tumors in the youngest age group were more often mucinous and signet ring cells (18.5%) versus (5.1%) in the oldest age group. The right colon was more often affected in the youngest age group, 38.9% versus 17.7% in the oldest age group (P=0.008). CONCLUSION: The proposition of colorectal cancer in subjects 50 or under was high in Morocco. Colorectal cancers in the youngest age group were more often mucinous or signet ring cells and was more often located in the right colon. We intend to complete this study by a genetic study to help improve prevention and care of young patient.
