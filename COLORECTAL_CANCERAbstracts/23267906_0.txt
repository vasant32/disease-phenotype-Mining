We report a case of metastatic liver carcinoma treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and hepatectomy. A 53-year-old man suffering from sigmoid colon carcinoma and unresectable multiple liver metastases was treated with capecitabine and oxaliplatin and bevacizumab. After the seventh course, tumor reduction was confirmed but liver dysfunction meant that it was difficult to continue the same regimen. Because preoperative evaluation of liver function showed a high risk of postoperative liver failure, a combination of partial hepatectomy and RFA was planned in order to reduce the amount of liver resection. High anterior resection, partial hepatectomy and RFA were performed as planned. He underwent S-1 therapy following 7 courses of irinotecan, S-1, and bevacizumab therapy. To date, no recurrence has been observed 18 months after the operation. A combination of hepatectomy and RFA is expected to be an effective local treatment for multiple liver metastases of colorectal cancer, although the evidence is currently insufficient.
