 OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the outcome of patients with colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) treated with stereotactic radiofrequency ablation (SRFA). METHODS: Following IRB approval, a retrospective evaluation of 98 SRFA treatment sessions of 189 CRLMs in 63 consecutive patients was performed. Local recurrence rate (LR), overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were analysed. RESULTS: LR was identified in 16% of the tumours (31/189), with no significant differences (P = 0.635) when comparing tumour sizes <3 cm (17.7%), 3-5 cm (11.1%) and >5 cm (17.4%). The median OS from SRFA treatment was 33.2 months after a mean follow-up of 25 months (range 2-66); the corresponding 1-, 3- and 5- year survival rates were 87%, 44% and 27%. The median OS was significantly different when comparing unresectable and resectable patients (27 vs. 58 months, P = 0.002) with OS rates of 92%, 66% and 48% at 1, 3 and 5 years in resectable patients. Tumour size did not affect OS and DFS. CONCLUSION: Due to the favourable outcome, SRFA challenges resection as first-line local treatment of patients with CRLM. As long as randomised studies are pending, we recommend entering an individual decision-making process with every patient. KEY POINTS: Large colorectal liver metastases can be effectively treated by stereotactic radiofrequency ablation (SRFA). Using SRFA the overall survival is not affected by tumour size. SRFA achieves similar overall and disease-free survival rates as surgical resection. SRFA challenges surgical resection as the first-line treatment for colorectal liver metastases.
