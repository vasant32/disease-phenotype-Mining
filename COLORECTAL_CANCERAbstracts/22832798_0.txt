 BACKGROUND/AIMS: Early detection of polyp is important for the prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC). There have been few studies to investigate the relationship between colorectal adenoma and family history of CRC (FHCRC) in Korea. The aim of this study was to identify the relationship between colorectal adenoma and FHCRC. METHODS: Between March 2009 and September 2010, 225 patients with adenomatous polyps were included. Their medical records with clinical history and size, numbers, histology of polyps were reviewed. Immunohistochemical staining using Bcl-2, Bax, p-AKT, NF-κB, and β-catenin antibodies were performed. We compared the histology of adenoma and expression of immunohistochemical staining according to the existence of FHCRC. RESULTS: The incidence of colorectal adenoma increased in case of FHCRC (p=0.029). In patients with FHCRC, the mean age of patients was 49 years old and younger than patients without FHCRC. In addition in patients with FHCRC, the incidence of advanced adenoma was significantly higher than in patients without FHCRC (p=0.001). The expression of Bax was significantly lower in patients with FHCRC than without FHCRC (p=0.046). CONCLUSIONS: There was a tendency for polyp to develop in their younger ages and to be more advanced adenomas in patients with FHCRC. The low expression of Bax, tumor suppressor gene, might be associated with the development of polyps in patient with FHCRC. Therefore, patients with FHCRC may be better to start screening colonoscopy earlier than patient without FHCRC.
