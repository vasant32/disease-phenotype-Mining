The V600E mutation of BRAF has emerged as both an effective biomarker and therapeutic target for select benign and malignant cutaneous and non-cutaneous human tumors and is typically determined using DNA-based techniques that include allele-specific PCR and direct DNA sequencing. Recently however, the development of new antibodies directed against the V600E protein has opened the door for an easier and more efficient strategy for identifying this mutation. Our present aim was to determine the efficacy of one such antibody, anti-B-Raf (V600E), a mouse monoclonal antibody in which the immunogen is a synthetic peptide derived from the internal region of BRAFV600E. A total of 35 cases of primary cutaneous melanoma were evaluated using a combination of DNA-based techniques that included allele-specific PCR and/or direct DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry. Cases of papillary thyroid carcinomas (n=5) and colorectal carcinomas (n=5), known to harbor the BRAFV600E mutation, served as positive controls for the study. DNA analyses revealed that 6 of 35 (17%) cases of the primary cutaneous malignant melanoma possessed the BRAFV600E mutation. For immunohistochemical analyses, cytoplasmic positivity with anti-B-Raf was noted in 7 of 35 (20%) cases of primary melanoma and in all 10 positive controls. Statistical analyses of the data demonstrated that the sensitivity of the immunohistochemistry was 100% and specificity was 97%. Findings from the current study support the potential use of immunohistochemistry as an ancillary screening tool to assess the BRAFV600E mutation status in primary cutaneous melanoma.
