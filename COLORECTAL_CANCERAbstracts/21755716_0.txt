This study compared Triclosan coated polyglactin 910 (Vicryl* Plus) with polyglactin 910 (Vicryl*) on abdominal wall healing in colorectal surgery patients. 184 patients with colorectal cancer were included in the study. In 91, the abdominal wall was closed with the Vicryl* Plus, and in 93 patients with Vicryl*. Demographic characteristics, biochemical inflammatory parameters, wound appearance, length of hospital stay, postoperative wound complications and post-incisional hernia were recorded. In the Vicryl* Plus group there was a shorter hospital stay (13.2 +/- 1.3 days; 21.4 +/- 2.8 respectively). In the Vicryl* Plus group inflammatory parameters decreased to normal within the first week whereas in the Vicryl* group remained increased. In the Vicryl* Plus group four patients had a wound discharge, seven had inflammatory reactions to the skin sutures. One dehiscence was noticed. In the Vicryl* group 12 patients had an SSI, 14 patients had inflammatory reactions to the skin sutures and 7 patients had a wound dehiscence. Closure of the abdominal wall using Vicryl* Plus decreases postoperative wound complications, length of hospital stay and is associated with a more rapid return of inflammatory markers to normal.
