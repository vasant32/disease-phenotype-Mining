BACKGROUND AND AIM: Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are at increased risk of colon cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the natural history of LGD and its progression to high grade dysplasia (HGD)/colorectal cancer (CRC) in PSC-UC patients. METHODS: Ten PSC-UC patients with LGD who underwent surveillance colonoscopy from 1996 to 2011 were evaluated. Raised dysplasia was defined as a discrete raised lesion located in an area involved by either quiescent or active colitis that was endoscopically resected, while flat dysplasia was defined as the absence of documentation of a raised lesion. RESULTS: Of the 10 patients with LGD, 3 (30%) progressed to raised HGD over a mean follow-up of 13Â±11months. Three of 10 patients had initial raised LGD while 7 had flat LGD. The location of HGD was in the proximal colon in all 3 patients. However all 3 patients who progressed to HGD had initial dysplasia located in the distal colon and had flat morphology. The incidence rate for detection of HGD/CRC was 9.4 cases per 100 person years at risk. Patients with LGD with flat morphology had an incidence rate of 17.8 cases per 100 person years at risk. HGD occurred more frequently within the first year of initial detection of LGD (23.5 per 100 patient years of follow-up). CONCLUSIONS: One-third of patients with LGD progressed to HGD/CRC in PSC-UC. Most patients progress within the first year of diagnosis of LGD supporting early colectomy in PSC-UC patients with LGD.
