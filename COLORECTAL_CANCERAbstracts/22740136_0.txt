Recently, a genome-wide association study of gastric cancer (GC) reported the significant association of seven genetic variants (rs4072037 and rs4460629 on 1q22; rs753724, rs11187842, rs3765524, rs2274223, and rs3781264 on 10q23) with GC in a Chinese population. These findings were confirmed in a subsequent independent study. However, it remains unknown whether these loci are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). This study was to test whether the seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with GC were also associated with CRC in a Chinese population. The seven SNPs were genotyped using MassARRAY system. Allelic, genotypic, and haplotypic associations of the SNPs with CRC were investigated using Ï‡(2) tests and logistic regression analysis. The SNPs rs3765524 and rs2274223, located on 10q23, were found to have significant protective effects against CRC, with equal odds ratios per allele. The two SNPs located on 1q22 (rs4072037 and rs4460629) showed a weak association with CRC. No significant association was identified with CRC for the remaining three SNPs located on 10q23 (rs753724, rs11187842, and rs3781264). These results suggest that rs3765524 and rs2274223 on 10q23 are associated with a protective effect against CRC in a Chinese population.
