OBJECTIVE: To present the epidemiological profile of cancer patients belonging to a database of a Hospital Cancer Registry and to report on the importance of this database in managing healthcare services at an Oncology and Hematology Center. METHODS: A retrospective survey conducted with 1617 records of patients diagnosed with cancer at the institution between 2004 and 2009. The types of cancer analyzed were of the colon and rectum, breast, prostate and lung. The variables used in the study were age, gender, stage of disease upon diagnosis and treatment. Researchers used an application called SisHCR for data collection, and ExcelÂ® for data analysis. To ensure data safety and reliability, passwords were required for accessing files, spreadsheets were backed up on a weekly basis, and patients' CPF numbers were used to avoid data duplication. RESULTS: Of the 1617 records analyzed, 36.42% belonged to the topographic group of the breast, and approximately 40% of patients with colorectal cancer were 70 years of age or older. Stage II was prevalent, representing 44% of the sample, and the treatment most used was surgery (57% of cases). CONCLUSION: The study suggested that the Hospital Cancer Registry database is an instrument capable of generating important information about cancer, and that through this information, epidemiological studies can be carried out and the processes of management and care can be improved.
