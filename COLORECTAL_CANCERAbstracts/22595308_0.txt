 BACKGROUND: It has long been suggested that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) might be involved in human oncogenesis. However, whether HCMV was associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) was still controversial. OBJECTIVE: To clarify whether HCMV specifically infects the tumorous tissue of CRC. STUDY DESIGN: Paired tumor and adjacent non-neoplastic CRC specimens were collected from 163 patients. HCMV DNA was detected and quantified through PCR and quantitative real-time PCR. Virus location was determined by in situ hybridization (ISH) of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections with an HCMV-specific probe. RESULTS: By PCR, HCMV DNA was detected in 42.3% (69/163) of the tumor specimens, while only 5.6%(14/163) samples of adjacent non-neoplastic tissue were positive for HCMV (p<0.0001). Quantitative real-time PCR in 54 sample pairs revealed significantly higher viral copies in the tumor specimens than the adjacent non-neoplastic tissue specimens (p<0.001). By ISH, the nucleic acids of HCMV were detected in the cytoplasm of neoplastic epithelium. No hybridization was detected in the inflammatory infiltrates, submucosa, or other stromal tissues. CONCLUSIONS: HCMV preferentially infects the tumor epithelium of CRC. How the virus subsists in and interacts with the microenvironment of tumor epithelium of CRC should be studied.
