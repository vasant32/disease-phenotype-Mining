 BACKGROUND: Hepatic resection is a potentially curative option for patients with colorectal liver metastases who are candidates for surgery. With the increasing availability of highly effective chemotherapy, surgery may be further advanced by the improved tumor response and better long-term outcomes associated with its use in the perioperative setting. METHODS: A commentary about the optimal timing of chemotherapy from the currently available evidence was performed. RESULTS: There is evidence to suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery for colorectal liver metastases improves disease-free and overall survival. The recent EORTC trial (40983) by Nordlinger and co-workers provides evidence for improved progression-free survival with the use of perioperative chemotherapy compared to surgery alone. CONCLUSION: Both adjuvant and perioperative chemotherapy appear to be beneficial over surgery alone for resectable colorectal liver metastases. Whether one is superior over the other remains unknown. Participation in ongoing trials to optimize the perioperative sequencing of chemotherapy would be important in identifying the optimal peri-surgical chemotherapy management of resectable colorectal liver metastases.
