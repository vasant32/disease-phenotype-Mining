Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in the nation. The incidence is especially high in the state of Louisiana, where the number of male deaths caused by colon cancer is higher than that in any other state in America. The excessive number of deaths may be attributed to decreased compliance with current screening recommendations. CRC screening, like most preventative health measures, is largely at the mercy of primary care physicians (PCPs) who must recommend or refer the patient before the preventative health measure can be completed. The project removed PCP dependence and made the patient an active participant in his or her care through a community-focused education program. The program provided instruction on CRC prevention and screening. Educational avenues used included flyer distribution, newspaper advertisements, radio advertisements, and publicly displayed posters. Patients were able to use the contact information provided to make an appointment with a provider, and insurance prerequisites, such as PCP referrals, were handled by the office staff. At the conclusion of the program, a statistical analysis showed increased compliance as a result of the educational program. A positive correlation was found between the intent of the education and the number of respondents.
