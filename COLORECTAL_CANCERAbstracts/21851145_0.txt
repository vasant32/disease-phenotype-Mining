 OBJECTIVE: To determine whether offering home fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) to eligible patients during a high volume influenza vaccination clinic could lead to increased colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) rates in a managed care setting. STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. METHODS: During influenza vaccination clinics in 2008, trained staff provided FITs to patients who were eligible for CRCS (FLU-FIT group) (FLU indicates influenza vaccine). Screening outcomes for this cohort of patients were compared with those of a similar group of influenza clinic attendees who were not exposed to the intervention (FLUonly group). RESULTS: Among eligible participants in the FLU-only group (N = 4653), 13.7% completed FIT within 90 days of their influenza vaccine, and in the FLU-FIT group (N = 2812), 30.3% completed FIT (P <.0001). In the FLU-FIT group, 1447 (51.4%) were provided with a FIT kit, and 653 (45.1%) of these patients completed a FIT kit within 90 days. In multivariate analyses, FLU-FIT group participants were significantly more likely to complete FITs compared with FLU-only group participants (Odds Ratio = 2.76 [95% confidence interval, 2.45-3.11]). Overall, the CRCS rate for the FLU-only group increased from 51.5% to 56.3% (increase of 4.8 percentage points), compared with an increase from 49.2% to 63.2% (increase of 14.0 percentage points) in the FLU-FIT group (P lt;.0001 for change difference). CONCLUSIONS: The FLU-FIT Program is feasible to implement in a high volume influenza vaccination clinic conducted in a managed care setting and increases colorectal cancer screening activity among eligible influenza vaccination recipients who are reached with the intervention.
