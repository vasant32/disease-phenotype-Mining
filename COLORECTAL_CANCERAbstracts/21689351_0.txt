 AIM: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is associated with an almost 100% chance of colorectal cancer by the age of 50 years. Surgery is the only prophylaxis. The study compared the outcome of prophylactic laparoscopic colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) with conventional open surgery. METHOD: A case-control study was carried out including all cases of proven FAP undergoing prophylactic laparoscopic colectomy with IRA between 1 April 2006 and 31 March 2008 using a standardized technique within an enhanced recovery programme (ERAS). All data were collected prospectively. Controls were identified retrospectively from patients who underwent open prophylactic IRA before 31 March 2008 and were matched for age, gender, BMI and ASA. Outcomes included duration of surgery, complications, length of stay, readmission and mortality. RESULTS: During the study period 25 patients underwent laparoscopic IRA. The median operating time was longer in the laparoscopic group (235 vs 180 mins, P < 0.0001) but the median hospital stay was shorter (6 vs 9 days, P = 0.002). Overall there were fewer complications in the laparoscopic group (20%vs 40%, P = 0.3). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic prophylactic colectomy with IRA in FAP is safe and feasible, and combined with ERAS leads to accelerated recovery and possibly fewer complications than open surgery. FAP patients undergoing prophylactic IRA should be offered laparoscopic surgery.
