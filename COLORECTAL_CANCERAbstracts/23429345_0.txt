Phytochemical investigation of an ethanolic extract of stems of Schisandra neglecta led to the isolation and identification of two new dibenzocyclooctadiene lignans, designated neglschisandrins E (1) and F (2), and thirteen known lignans. All structures and stereochemistries were determined by spectroscopic methods, including 2D-NMR techniques. The isolates were evaluated for in vitro cytotoxic activity. Among them, compounds 2-6 exhibited moderate to weak cytotoxicity against the human colorectal carcinoma HCT-8 cell line with EC₅₀ values of 7.33~19.8 μg/mL. In addition, compounds 2-4 also exhibited marginal cytotoxicity against the human lung carcinoma A549 cell line with EC₅₀ values of 11.8~15.0 μg/mL.
