PURPOSE: Laparoscopic colorectal surgery is a technically challenging procedure for beginners, such as surgical fellows. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety, feasibility, and short-term surgical outcomes of laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery by a single surgical fellow. METHODS: The study analyzed the data from 143 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal resection by a single surgical fellow between August 2009 and October 2010. The patients were divided into two groups: the early group-the first 70 patients (under supervision of experienced surgeon), and the late group-the last 73 patients (without supervision). The short-term surgical results were compared between two groups. RESULTS: The operations were 24 right colon resections, two transverse colectomies, six left colectomies, 36 anterior resections, 57 low anterior resections, 12 intersphincteric resections, two abdominoperineal resections, three Hartmann's operations, and 1 total colectomy. The mean operating time, mean amounts of blood loss, and conversion rate were similar between the two groups. The morbidity rate, anastomosis leak rate, and mortality rate within 30 days of surgery did not differ significantly. The mean number of lymph nodes was larger in the late group (23.8 vs. 31.7, P = 0.017). In terms of low anterior resection, the mean number of endo-linear staplers used was smaller in the late group (2.46 ± 0.81 vs. 1.97 ± 0.83, P = 0.028). The anastomosis leakage rate in rectal cancer surgery was not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that laparoscopic colorectal resections can be independently performed safely after a period of supervision and training by an experienced surgeon.
