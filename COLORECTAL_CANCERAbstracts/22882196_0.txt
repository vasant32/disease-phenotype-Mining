 BACKGROUND: Ultrasound (US) is the most commonly used form of image guidance during liver surgery. However, the use of navigation systems that incorporate instrument tracking and three-dimensional visualization of preoperative tomography is increasing. This report describes an initial experience using an image-guidance system with navigated US. METHODS: An image-guidance system was used in a total of 50 open liver procedures to aid in localization and targeting of liver lesions. An optical tracking system was employed to localize surgical instruments. Customized hardware and calibration of the US transducer were required. The results of three procedures are highlighted in order to illustrate specific navigation techniques that proved useful in the broader patient cohort. RESULTS: Over a 7-month span, the navigation system assisted in completing 21 (42%) of the procedures, and tracked US alone provided additional information required to perform resection or ablation in six procedures (12%). Average registration time during the three illustrative procedures was <1 min. Average set-up time was approximately 5 min per procedure. CONCLUSIONS: The Explorerâ„¢ Liver guidance system represents novel technology that continues to evolve. This initial experience indicates that image guidance is valuable in certain procedures, specifically in cases in which difficult anatomy or tumour location or echogenicity limit the usefulness of traditional guidance methods.
