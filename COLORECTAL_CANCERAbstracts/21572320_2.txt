 OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to identify determinants of disease recurrence after potentially curative resection of colorectal cancer. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The identification of patients at increased risk of disease recurrence is currently based on pathological factors. Recently, there has been considerable interest in the potential impact of perioperative factors on long-term colorectal cancer outcome. Few studies have examined pre-, intra-, and postoperative variables in a single cohort. METHODS: Four hundred and twenty-three patients with histologically confirmed colorectal cancer who underwent surgery with curative intent between 1997 and 2007 were included. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative variables were recorded. Logistic and Cox regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of surgical complications and disease recurrence, respectively. RESULTS: The postoperative mortality rate was 4% and the morbidity rate 34%. The most important predictors of complications were smoking (odd ratio [OR] 1.32), ASA grade (OR 1.90) and POSSUM operative score (OR 1.32). During follow up (median 80 months), 35% of patients developed disease recurrence. Predictors of recurrence, independent of tumor stage, were POSSUM physiology score (hazard ratio [HR] 1.31) and systemic inflammatory response (HR 1.31). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative risk factors, but not postoperative complications, are associated with early disease recurrence after potentially curative resection of colorectal cancer.
