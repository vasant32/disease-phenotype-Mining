 AIM: The 30-day outcome after laparoscopic resection for cancer in patients over the age of 80 years was studied. METHOD: An electronic database was used to identify patients over 80 years who underwent laparoscopic bowel resection between December 2000 and October 2009 at three UK laparoscopic colorectal training units. Patients who required abdominoperineal excision of the rectum were excluded. RESULTS: In all, 173 patients (80 men) of median age 84 (80-93) years were identified. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grades were ASA 1, 14; ASA 2, 87; ASA 3, 68; and ASA 4, 4. Median body mass index was 26 (14-45) kg/m(2). Thirteen (7.5%) patients were converted to open surgery. The major causes for conversion were bleeding and adhesions. Thirty-three major complications occurred in 21 (12%) patients. Ten (5.8%) required readmission after discharge for complications giving a total of 17.8% of patients with complications. The median hospital stay was 5 (1-37) days. Three (1.7%) patients died within 30 days of surgery. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that laparoscopic large bowel resection is safe and beneficial in a population over 80 years. It has low morbidity and mortality and a shortened hospital stay. Octogenarians should not be denied major laparoscopic bowel surgery based on age alone.
