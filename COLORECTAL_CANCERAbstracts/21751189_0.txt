 BACKGROUND: Screening by fecal occult blood test and lower endoscopy has lowered colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality, but compliance gaps persist. Of concern are possible disparities in uptake of CRC screening between white and African American men. The goal of this study was to assess for disparities in uptake of CRC screening among men participating in a high-risk prostate cancer clinic. If present, such disparities could support hypotheses for further research examining racial differences in awareness and patient preferences in undergoing CRC screening. METHODS: Baseline data on a racially diverse cohort of men aged 50 to 69 years at increased risk of prostate cancer collected via the Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment Program at Fox Chase Cancer Center were analyzed. Predictors of uptake of CRC screening were assessed using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Compared with whites, African American men had statistically significantly lower uptake of fecal occult blood testing (African American 49.0% vs white 60.7%, P = .035), lower endoscopy (African American 44.1% vs white 58.5%, P = .011), and any CRC screening (African American 66.2% vs white 76.3%, P = .053). Predictors of uptake of lower endoscopy among African American men included older age (odds ratio [OR], 3.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.87-6.97), family history of CRC (OR, 3.47; 95% CI, 1.30-9.25), and insurance status (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.04-3.46). CONCLUSIONS: Despite awareness of cancer risk and motivation to seek prostate cancer screening through a specialized prostate cancer risk assessment program, evidence supporting compliance gaps with CRC screening among men was found. Tailored messages to younger African American men with and without a family history of CRC are needed.
