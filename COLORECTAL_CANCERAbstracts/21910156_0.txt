Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SMAD7 (18q21) have been linked to colorectal cancer (CRC) risk in genome-wide association studies, but little is known about their effects on survival. SMAD7 regulates gastrointestinal inflammation by inhibiting transforming growth factor-Î² (TGFB), which can act as both a tumor suppressor and a promoter of metastasis. Regular use of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) inhibitors, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), reduces the risk of developing CRC. Because COX2 overexpression reduces the growth suppressing effects of TGFB, we hypothesized that survival may depend on both SMAD7 genotype and prediagnostic NSAID use. Postmenopausal women, ages 50-74, diagnosed with incident invasive CRC from 1997 to 2002 were identified using the Seattle-Puget Sound Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry. Information on prediagnostic NSAID use and other risk factors was ascertained by interview, and women were followed-up for survival through December 31, 2009. Seven hundred and twenty-seven cases were genotyped for two GWAS hits in SMAD7 with minor allele frequency > 30%, one with minor allele associated with decreased risk (rs4939827) and one with minor allele associated with increased risk (rs4464148). Two hundred and forty-two deaths occurred, 160 attributable to CRC. Among those without distant disease at diagnosis, CRC-specific survival differed by genotype only for NSAID users: each minor allele of rs4939827 was associated with worse survival [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.67, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.33-5.37] and each minor allele of rs4464148 was associated with better survival (HR = 0.41, CI 0.18-0.94). SMAD7 variants known to be important for CRC risk were associated with disease-specific survival among prediagnostic NSAID users.
