Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Risk factors are extent and severity of colonic inflammation, concurrent primary sclerosing cholangitis, and a positive family history of sporadic CRC. The chromosomal instability, microsatellite instability and hypermethylation pathways form the molecular background of IBD-related carcinogenesis, which is not different from sporadic CRC. The dysplasia-carcinoma sequence of IBD-related colorectal carcinogenesis makes patients suitable for endoscopic surveillance. In the future, new molecular biomarkers and endoscopic techniques may improve early detection of precursor lesions of IBD-related CRC. The potential of aminosalicylates and ursodeoxycholic acid as chemopreventive agents needs to be studied in randomized clinical trials. Patients with IBD who are being treated with thiopurines have a slightly increased risk of developing lymphoproliferative disorders, whereas patients with small bowel Crohn's disease have a high relative risk and a small absolute risk of developing small bowel adenocarcinoma.
