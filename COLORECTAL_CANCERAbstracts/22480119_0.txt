Colorectal cancer, a public health problem with major social implications, has attracted major economic resources and specialized centers focused in the direction of obtaining an early diagnosis from effective screening means in the last decades. It is obvious that the therapeutic results and the social costs are primarily dependent on the precocity of diagnosis. The present paper aims to bring to attention a number of orientations, which may open a new perspective in approaching the genetic and molecular level of these lesions. Out of these, the value of the molecular screening based on the detection of the APC gene located on the short arm of chromosome 5, a method that allows the selection of the subjects to be subjected to further endoscopic screening is underlined. The optimization of the costs as well as the increased compliance of the subjects to such a method is thus accomplished.
