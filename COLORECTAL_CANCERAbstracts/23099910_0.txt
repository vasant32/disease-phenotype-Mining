 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of tight junction protein Claudin-1 and Claudin-4 in colorectal cancer tissues and its clinical significance. METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining detected the expression of tight junction protein Claudin-1 and Claudin-4 in 60 cases of colorectal cancer and 20 normal colorectal mucosa tissue. The clinical significance was analyzed. RESULTS: The positive rates of Claudin-1 and Claudin-4 in colorectal cancer tissues were 76.6%(46/60) and 85.0%(51/60), significantly higher than 20.0% (4/20) and 30.0%(6/20) in the normal colorectal mucosa(both P<0.01). The positive rates of Claudin-1 and Claudin-4 were associated with tumor differentiation degree, lymph node metastasis and TNM staging(all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The high expression of the Claudin-1 and Claudin-4 may play a promoting role in colorectal cancer development and progression.  Claudin-1 and Claudin-4 may become prognostic markers of colorectal cancer.
