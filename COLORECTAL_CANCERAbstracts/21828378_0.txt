 BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common malignancy in Japan. Treatment with inhibitors of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signalling pathway has proven benefit in metastatic CRC. Cediranib is an oral highly potent VEGF signalling inhibitor that inhibits all three VEGF receptors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 172 patients with metastatic CRC were randomised to receive once-daily cediranib (20 or 30 mg) or placebo, each combined with modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6). The primary objective was comparison of progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: The comparison of cediranib 20 mg versus placebo met the primary objective of PFS prolongation [hazard ratio = 0.70 (95% confidence interval 0.44-1.11), P = 0.167], which met the protocol-defined criterion of P < 0.2. Median PFS was 10.2 versus 8.3 months, respectively. The PFS comparison for cediranib 30 mg versus placebo did not meet the criterion. The most common adverse events (AEs) in the cediranib-containing groups were diarrhoea and hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Cediranib 20 mg plus mFOLFOX6 met the predefined criteria in terms of improved PFS compared with placebo plus mFOLFOX6. Cediranib 20 mg was generally well tolerated and the AE profile was consistent with previous studies.
