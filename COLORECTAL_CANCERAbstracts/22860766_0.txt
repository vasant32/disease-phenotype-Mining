Recent evidence suggests that fatty acid synthase mediating de novo fatty acid synthesis plays a crucial role in the carcinogenesis process of various cancers. Moreover, HER2 and related PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which links intimately with cellular metabolism, influence cancer biological behavior. However, it remains unknown whether malignant phenotype of colorectal cancer cells is regulated by the HER2-PI3K/Akt-FASN signaling pathway. In this study, Caco-2 cells were selected for functional characterization, and treated with ZSTK474, followed by RT-qPCR and Western blot assays examining PI3K, Akt, HER2, and FASN expression. The MTT and colony formation assays were used to assess proliferation. The migration was investigated by transwell, apoptosis, and cell-cycle analysis. We found that the blockade of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by ZSTK474 treatment led to downregulation of PI3K, Akt, HER2, and FASN expression. The proliferation was decreased upon treatment which was consistent with an increased percentage of G(1) arrested cells instead of apoptosis. The migration of Caco-2 cells was also impaired by ZSTK474 treatment. Inhibition of HER2-PI3K/Akt signaling pathway suppresses FASN expression of Caco-2 cells, and inhibition of FASN expression changes malignant phenotype of Caco-2 cells.
