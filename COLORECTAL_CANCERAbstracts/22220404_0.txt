Natural killer T (NKT) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an important role in innate immune response. Natural killer (NK) and NKT cells are indispensable factors in the body's ongoing defense against tumor development, as well as viral infection. NKT cells are a subset of T cells that shares properties of natural killer cells and conventional T cells. They are involved in innate immune responses, tumor rejection, post transplantation immunotherapy, immune surveillance and control of autoimmune diseases. They may also play both protective and harmful roles in the progression of certain autoimmune diseases, such as diabetes, lupus, atherosclerosis, and allergen-induced asthma. Immune surveillance involves the process whereby precancerous and malignant cells are recognized by the host immune system as damaged and are consequently targeted for elimination. The pharmacological management of postoperative pain in patients with malignancies uses very different techniques whose possible cytotoxic functions we still known very poor. The present study compared effects of two different postoperative pain management techniques in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery on the innate immunity. Our data indicate that the patients with colorectal cancer have significantly increased the percentage of Tregs and NKT cells. The values were statistically higher during epidural analgesia in comparison with intravenous analgesia, indicating that epidural pain management technique ameliorate the immune suppression after surgery.
