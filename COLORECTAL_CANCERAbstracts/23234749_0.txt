 BACKGROUND: adenocarcinoid tumor is a rare malignancy that combines clinical and histological features of epithelial origin (adenocarcinoma) and neuroendocrine (carcinoid), occupies less than 1 % of all colorectal cancer histology, occurring mainly in the appendix and its presence in the colon is rare. CLINICAL CASE: we present a case of a 41-year-old female with sigmoid colon tumor, who underwent an extended left hemicolectomy and anastomosis; having a good postoperative evolution, with hospital stay of seventh days. The final histopathological study reported was adenocarcinoid colon tumor with free margins of injuries and four positive nodes of adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: adenocarcinoid tumors are present in the appendix in 85 to 95 % of all cases and only 6 % are located in the colon (13 % in sigmoid). Early diagnosis is certainly the most important determinant of good prognosis, in these cases the five-year survival is 80 to 84 %, and 15 years of 60 %.
