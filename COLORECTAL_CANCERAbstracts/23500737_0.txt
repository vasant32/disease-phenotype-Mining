 INTRODUCTION: Non-muscle invasive transtitional cell carcinoma (TCC) with metastases is exceedingly rare. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report the case of a 78-year old man with an incidental finding of a non-muscle invasive TCC of the left distal ureter during treatment for Duke's B Colon cancer. Following laparoscopic nephro-ureterectomy (LNU) he had two further superficial recurrences in the bladder over a 14-month period which underwent transurethral resection (TUR). On surveillance imaging for his colorectal cancer follow-up a lung nodule was detected and video-assisted thoracic surgical (VATS) resection of the lesion showed it to be TCC in origin. He was referred to oncology for chemotherapy and remains clinically well. DISCUSSION: A Literature search found only three other such cases and the ureteric TCC is the most likely source of the metastasis. CONCLUSION: This occurrence is exceedingly rare.
