The p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) plays important roles in cell growth, motility, and transformation. The aims of this study were to delineate the signalling mechanisms downstream of PAK1, and to investigate the importance of PAK1 for colorectal cancer (CRC) growth and metastasis in vivo. PAK1 knockdown in human CRC cell lines inhibited β-catenin expression, β-catenin/TCF4 transcriptional activity, and the expression of c-Myc. In mouse models PAK1 knockdown suppressed the growth and metastasis of human CRC cells by decreasing proliferation and increasing apoptosis. Our findings demonstrate for the first time the crucial role of PAK1 in CRC progression in vivo.
