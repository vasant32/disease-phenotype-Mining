BACKGROUND: This longitudinal study describes the five year trajectories of health-related quality of life(HR-QOL) and life satisfaction in long term colorectal cancer survivors.Patients and methodsA population-based sample of 1966 colorectal cancer survivors were surveyed at six timepoints from five months to five years post-diagnosis. Predictor variables were: sociodemographicvariables, optimism; cancer threat appraisal; perceived social support. Qualityof life was assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal (HRQOL);and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. Growth mixture models were applied to identifytrajectory classes and their predictors. RESULTS: Distinct adjustment trajectories were identified for HR-QOL and life satisfaction. Loweroptimism, poorer social support, a more negative cognitive appraisal, and younger age wereassociated with poorer life satisfaction, while survivors with less than 8 years of educationhad higher life satisfaction. This pattern was similar for overall HR-QOL except thateducational level was not a significant predictor and later stage disease and female genderemerged as related to poorer outcomes. One in five survivors reported poorer constant HRQOL(19.2%) and a small group had poor life satisfaction (7.2%); 26.2% reported constanthigh HR-QOL and 48.8% had high constant life satisfaction. Socioeconomic disadvantageand remoteness of residence uniquely predicted poorer outcomes in the colorectal cancerspecific HR-QOL sub domain. CONCLUSION: Although HR-QOL and subjective cognitive QOL share similar antecedents their trajectorypatterns suggested they are distinct adjustment outcomes; with life satisfaction emerging astemporally stable phenomenon. Unique patterns of risk support suggest the need to accountfor heterogeneity in adjustment in longitudinal QOL studies with cancer survivors.
