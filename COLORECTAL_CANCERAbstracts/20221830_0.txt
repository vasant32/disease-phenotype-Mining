 PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of FOLFIRI regimen in patients with advanced colorectal cancer refractory to fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin. METHODS: The FOLFIRI regimen consisted of intravenous infusion of irinotecan 180 mg/m(2) on day 1 plus leucovorin (LV) 400 mg/m(2) on day 1 plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 400 mg/m(2) bolus on day 1 plus 46-hour intravenous infusion of 5-FU 2,400 mg/m(2), every 2 weeks as one cycle. The main selection criterion for this study was the advanced colorectal cancer refractory to fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin. RESULTS: Of the 57 evaluable patients for efficacy, 4 (7.5%) had a partial response, 36 (67.9%) had stable disease, and 13 (24.5%) had progressive disease. Median progression-free survival was 4.8 months (95% CI 3.9-5.7 months), and median overall survival was 7.8 months (95% CI 13.1-16.5 months). Safety analysis was based on the data of 57 evaluable patients. The most frequently observed grade 3 or 4 toxicities were neutropenia 16 (27.8%), nausea/vomiting 7 (12.3%), and diarrhea 1 (1.8%). CONCLUSION: FOLFIRI regimen is effective and well tolerated in patients with advanced colorectal cancer refractory to fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin in Chinese population.
