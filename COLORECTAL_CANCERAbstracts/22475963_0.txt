An early diagnosis of colorectal polyp can be achieved through screening and surveillance programs. In the past few years, advances in endoscopic imaging of the colorectal mucosa have been extensively developed, leading to an increased detection of pre-malignant lesions as well as low-grade and nonneoplastic polyps. In order to reduce the overall cost of care with minimal impact on the quality of care in colorectal cancer prevention, the "diagnosis and discard" strategy has been considered. High-definition, narrow band imaging and confocal endomicroscopy are image enhancement technologies that have been widely studied lately. The studies from Pasha et al. and Kuiper et al. demonstrate the limitations of these new advanced imaging technologies and that further studies should continue to be developed.
