 AIM: To analyze the upregulated CD133 expression in tumorigenesis of primary colon cancer cells. METHODS: Upregulated CD133 expression in tumorigenesis of colorectal cancer cell lines (Lovo, Colo205, Caco-2, HCT116 and SW620) was analyzed by flow cytometry. Human colon cancer tissue samples were stained with anti-human CD133. SW620 cells were sorted according to the CD133 expression level measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Spheroids of colorectal cancer cells were cultured with the hanging drop. Expression of CD133 and Lgr5 in spheroids of colorectal cancer cells and monolayer culture was detected by RT-qPCR. Spheroids of colorectal cancer cells were analyzed using anti-human CD133 with immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: CD133 antigen was expressed in colorectal cancer cell lines (Lovo, Colo205, Caco-2, HCT116 and SW620) as well as in primary and metastatic human colon cancer tissues. However, the CD133 was differently expressed in these cell lines and tissues. The expression levels of CD133 and Lgr5 were significantly higher in spheroids of parental, CD133(hi) and CD133⁻ cells than in their monolayer culture at the mRNA level (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemical staining of spheroids of CD133⁻ cells showed that CD133 was highly expressed in colorectal cancer cell lines. CONCLUSION: Upregulated CD133 expression plays a role in tumorigenesis colorectal cancer cells, which may promote the expression of other critical genes that can drive tumorigenesis.
