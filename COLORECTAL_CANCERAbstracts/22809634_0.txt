 BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) are uncommon diseases and both are associated with marked increased risk of colorectal cancer. METHODS: We present a patient diagnosed in parallel with ulcerative colitis and FAP. Mutational analysis of the APC germline and somatic DNA was performed by sequencing. RESULTS: This patient's phenotype consisted of polyps only on the right side of the colon (cecum and ascending colon) whereas the area affected by ulcerative colitis (descending colon and rectum) was free of polyps on endoscopy and microscopic adenomas on histology. This raises the possibility that mosaicism or inflammation in the presence of active ulcerative colitis modified the phenotypic expression of adenomatous polyposis in the left colon. Mosaicism was excluded by DNA analysis. DISCUSSION: This case of a patient diagnosed with both inflammatory bowel disease and familial adenomatous polyposis offers potential insights into the distinct pathogenesis of cancer susceptibility within these syndromes, and suggests that a collision of phenotypes may influence their mutual presentation. Both of these conditions independently increase the risk of colorectal cancer.
