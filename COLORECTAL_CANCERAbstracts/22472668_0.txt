Guidelines published by the American College of Gastroenterologists suggest that African Americans (AA) begin preventive screening at the age of 45 years due to increased risk of colorectal cancer. This study examines characteristics associated with having fecal occult blood tests (FOBT), sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy among adults aged 45-75 years. Using cross-sectional data from the 2007 Health Information National Trends Survey, the sample included 3,725 participants (mean age = 59.01 Â± 8.41), with 59.8% female, 88.8% Caucasian, and 11.2% AA. Binary logistic regression with interactions between race, gender, and age entered in block 2 revealed that odds of having FOBT, colonoscopy, or sigmoidoscopy were increased among older individuals with higher education. Fecal occult blood test was higher among women and those with insurance. Colonoscopy was higher among those with insurance and higher income. Having a sigmoidoscopy was more likely among those with higher income but was lower among AA men. Understanding the characteristics of individuals who participate in colorectal cancer screenings may contribute to the development of interventions geared toward those who do not, particularly AA men who are at greatest risk for colorectal morbidity and mortality.
