AIM: The TMN staging system is the most important tool to predict long-term survival of colorectal cancer patients. However, physiological conditions and the operation may also influence survival. This study evaluated the impact of the Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enUmeration of Mortality and morbidity (POSSUM) and the colorectal version (CR-POSSUM) on the long-term survival of patients with rectal cancer. METHOD: Prospectively collected data were included of consecutive patients who underwent rectal cancer resection during 2000 - 2004. The relationship between the POSSUM and CR-POSSUM scores and the physiological components with outcomes and survivals were analyzed. RESULTS: The study included 343 patients (196 males, 263 open resections, 74 laparoscopic resections, 6 local resections) with a mean follow-up of 56.5 months. Thirty-five patients had had neoadjuvant chemoradiation and 115 had adjuvant chemotherapy. Their median POSSUM score was 34 (interquartile range 31 - 39) and the median CR-POSSUM score was 19 (interquartile range 18 - 21). The Log rank test showed a significant difference (p<0.05) in long-term survival for patients who belonged to different score groups of POSSUM and physiological component of the POSSUM system. Factors found on multivariate analysis to have significant association with long-term survival included TMN stage, perineural invasion, local invasion, obstruction, emergency operation, POSSUM score and physiological score of POSSUM. CONCLUSION: The mortality of patients after rectal cancer surgery can be predicted by POSSUM, P-POSSUM or CR-POSSUM with no significant difference between them. Both POSSUM and physiological score of POSSUM were significantly related with survival. The POSSUM score was one of the factors that independently predicted long-term survival.
